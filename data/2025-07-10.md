### [1] [Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network for Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06735)
*Guan Zheng,Xue Wang,Wenhua Qian,Peng Liu,Runzhuo Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPFNet是一种基于残差先验和频域融合的图像融合网络，通过双分支框架和交叉促进模块提升融合效果，实验验证其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像融合中长距离特征依赖计算成本高和缺乏真实数据的问题。

Method: 采用双分支框架（RPM和FDFM）和交叉促进模块（CPM），结合辅助解码器和损失函数优化。

Result: RPFNet能有效整合特征、增强纹理细节和显著对象，提升高级视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: RPFNet在图像融合中表现出色，为高级视觉任务提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

### [2] [Dual-Granularity Cross-Modal Identity Association for Weakly-Supervised Text-to-Person Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06744)
*Yafei Zhang,Yongle Shang,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种局部和全局双粒度身份关联机制，通过跨模态身份关系增强和动态调整机制，显著提升了文本到人物图像匹配的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升，因此需要一种更有效的方法来减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。

Method: 采用局部和全局双粒度身份关联机制，局部层面显式建立跨模态身份关系，全局层面构建动态跨模态身份关联网络，并结合信息不对称样本对构建和一致性学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

### [3] [Unveiling the Underwater World: CLIP Perception Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06234)
*Jiangzhong Cao,Zekai Zeng,Xu Zhang,Huan Zhang,Chunling Fan,Gangyi Jiang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CLIP感知损失模块和课程对比正则化的水下图像增强方法，以提升感知质量和内容恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在水下图像增强中忽视人类感知且缺乏解空间约束，导致增强图像感知质量下降或内容恢复不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP模型的视觉语义特征提取能力学习提示对，评估图像质量，并作为感知损失模块融入增强网络；结合课程对比正则化优化约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化能有效提升水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

### [4] [SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06265)
*Ali Nasiri-Sarvi,Hassan Rivaz,Mahdi S. Hosseini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC框架通过统一稀疏潜在空间和跨模型语义一致性，显著提升了不同AI模型间概念对齐的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因模型独立表示导致的概念空间不兼容问题，实现跨模型和跨模态的通用概念对齐。

Method: 提出SPARC框架，利用Global TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，强制不同模型共享统一的潜在空间。

Result: 在Open Images数据集上，SPARC的Jaccard相似度达到0.80，比之前方法提升三倍以上。

Conclusion: SPARC不仅实现了跨模型概念对齐，还支持文本引导的空间定位和跨模态检索等应用。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/SPARC.

### [5] [MST-Distill: Mixture of Specialized Teachers for Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07015)
*Hui Li,Pengfei Yang,Juanyang Chen,Le Dong,Yanxin Chen,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MST-Distill提出了一种新颖的跨模态知识蒸馏框架，通过混合专业教师模型和动态路由网络解决了传统方法的路径选择和知识漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在跨模态场景中因数据和统计异质性难以利用跨模态教师模型的互补先验知识。

Method: MST-Distill采用多教师模型集成和实例级路由网络，结合掩码模块抑制模态差异。

Result: 在五个多模态数据集上的实验表明，MST-Distill显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MST-Distill有效解决了跨模态知识蒸馏的挑战，提升了知识迁移效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is
available at https://github.com/Gray-OREO/MST-Distill.

### [6] [A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)
*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF是一种用于神经隐式SDF模型不确定性量化的概率框架，通过拉普拉斯近似实现高效计算，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林流体模拟）需要精确的几何和不确定性量化，现有方法缺乏几何一致性。

Method: 利用拉普拉斯近似和基于Hessian的度量量化局部表面不稳定性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，不确定性预测与几何重建质量高度相关。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D重建和模拟提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

### [7] [LIRA: Inferring Segmentation in Large Multi-modal Models with Local Interleaved Region Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06272)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和理解任务中的不准确和幻觉问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在分割和理解任务中存在不准确分割和幻觉理解的问题，主要源于视觉理解能力弱和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割准确性和减少幻觉理解。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中实现了最先进的性能，并通过AttrEval数据集量化了语义推断能力。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，有效解决了多模态模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于提升多类别分割模型在野火科学领域的性能，特别是针对火类分割。该方法通过集中复制粘贴火簇来增加数据集多样性，实验证明其优于其他增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在野火科学领域，获取和标注用于训练分割模型的图像成本高昂且公开数据集稀缺，尤其是火类的标注数据。这限制了分割模型的性能提升。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三个步骤：(i)识别源图像中的火簇，(ii)通过集中技术聚焦火区核心，(iii)将精炼的火簇粘贴到目标图像上，以增加数据集多样性。

Result: 通过数值分析和多目标优化比较，CCPDA显著提升了火类分割的性能指标，优于其他数据增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小型手动标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在提升火类分割性能方面表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

*Fuyuan Zhang,Qichen Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR2通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs）来提升预训练CNN的鲁棒性，无需改变架构，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2采用CAM对齐策略，通过迭代修复（CAM引导的细化和标准微调交替）增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: AR2在CIFAR-10-C等基准测试中优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据准确性和损坏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AR2为实际环境中的模型可靠性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of

Result: 实验显示，方法达到SOTA性能，推理速度提高35倍，吞吐量达145 Hz。

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且泛化能力强，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Result: 在THUMOS-14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS Segments数据集上，性能分别提升了2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: THOR是一种实时自适应时空RGB帧采样方法，利用热感技术捕捉手部活动，显著减少数据量和能耗，同时保持高识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴相机连续处理RGB图像时的高能耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 结合低分辨率热感数据动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热感线索定位手部活动区域以减少处理范围。

Result: 仅使用3%的原始RGB数据，实现了95%的手部活动识别F1分数，与完整视频（94%）相当。

Conclusion: THOR为实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件自动编码器的高效事件数据压缩与重建方法，显著提升了事件相机的物体检测性能，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统在动态环境中存在运动模糊、高延迟和数据冗余问题，事件相机虽能解决这些问题，但稀疏和噪声的事件流给物体检测带来挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码的事件自动编码器架构，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，优化事件数据的空间和时间特征保留。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8至44.8 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了事件相机的实时性能，适用于低功耗、高速的边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

TL;DR: Video-RTS通过结合数据高效的强化学习和视频自适应测试时间缩放策略，显著提升了视频推理能力的数据效率，无需大规模监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法依赖大规模监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用纯强化学习训练和基于输出的奖励机制，结合稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本就平均提升了2.4%的准确率，在Video-Holmes和MMVU上分别提升了4.2%和2.6%。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频测试时间缩放的互补优势，实现了强大的推理性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mask6D的新预训练策略，通过结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，提升了单目RGB图像在复杂或遮挡条件下的6D物体姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在复杂场景中难以提取具有区分性的姿态感知特征，尤其是在目标被遮挡时。

Method: 使用2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，结合RGB图像进行基于重建的模型预训练，并设计了专注于物体的预训练损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过引入姿态感知信息和掩码指导，显著提升了复杂场景下的姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双边协作框架（BC-HOI），通过注意力偏差引导（ABG）和基于大语言模型的监督引导（LSG），解决了开放词汇人-物交互（HOI）检测中视觉特征粒度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的粗粒度特征，与检测任务的细粒度需求矛盾。

Method: 提出BC-HOI框架，包含ABG（引导VLM生成细粒度特征）和LSG（利用LLM提供细粒度监督）。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: BC-HOI框架有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测的性能。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Abstract: Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have
significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To
facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey
systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in

that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories
and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related
fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the
analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and
visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The
cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the
aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and
recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving
field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic
resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.

Method: 提出FIFA框架，提取描述性事实，建模时空语义依赖图，并通过VideoQA模型验证；引入Post-Correction工具修正幻觉内容。

Result: FIFA比现有评估方法更接近人类判断，Post-Correction有效提升了文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和Post-Correction为VideoMLLMs的忠实性评估和修正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与生成能力，导致安全风险。

Method: KSCU方法利用扩散模型的逐步采样特性，专注于关键步骤进行微调，减少参数更新。

Result: 实验证明KSCU能有效阻止生成不良图像，同时保留生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU为文本到图像扩散模型的安全使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

Motivation: 解决将口语英语转换为手语动画的挑战，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用Whisper进行语音转文本，MarianMT模型翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，利用Sign3D-WLASL数据集生成3D动画。

Result: 系统表现良好，BLEU分数达0.7714和0.8923，生成流畅自然的3D手语动画。

Conclusion: 该流程整合音频、文本和动作，实现从英语语音到逼真3D手语动画的完整转换。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模和自适应锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Conclusion: 该方法为野生动物监测和保护的自动化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Conclusion: ToBo能有效学习动态场景的表示，且在不同模型规模下具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但其广泛使用引发了版权和透明度问题。现有方法无法准确识别对特定元素（如风格或对象）的贡献，因此需要更细粒度的归因方法。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，改进边缘检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失函数对所有非边缘像素一视同仁，忽略了边缘附近的结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失函数，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 实验证明EBT损失在多个基准测试中表现优越，且对超参数变化鲁棒。

Conclusion: EBT损失易于部署，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

TL;DR: MOST是一种新颖的运动扩散模型，通过时间片段Banzhaf交互解决从罕见语言提示生成人类运动的挑战，实现了细粒度的文本-运动匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在粗粒度匹配和语义线索捕捉上存在不足，MOST通过利用细粒度片段关系来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用时间片段Banzhaf交互量化文本-运动一致性，结合运动提示模块生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本-运动检索和生成上达到最先进水平，尤其在罕见提示上表现优异。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度交互和生成模块，显著提升了文本到运动任务的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应边距对比学习方法（AMContrast3D++），用于点云的3D语义分割，通过模糊度估计和并行训练分支提升性能。


<details>

Method: 设计AMContrast3D++，结合对比学习和模糊度预测模块，通过掩码细化机制优化模糊点嵌入。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了分割性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自适应模糊度估计和并行训练分支显著提升了3D语义分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种双摄像头系统（DCS）和曝光自适应融合网络（EAFNet）来解决HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，通过预对齐和特征融合实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交替曝光方法中的曝光波动导致HDR视频重建中出现闪烁问题，需要一种更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用双摄像头系统（DCS）分别捕获参考和非参考序列，结合EAFNet进行预对齐、特征融合和多尺度重建。

Result: 实验表明该方法在不同数据集上达到最先进性能，验证了DCS在HDR视频重建中的潜力。

Conclusion: DCS和EAFNet的组合有效解决了HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，并展示了高性能。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨模态双因果学习（CMDCL）方法，通过文本和视觉因果干预解决长时动作识别中的跨模态偏见和视觉干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉干扰而具有挑战性，现有方法缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Method: 引入结构因果模型，通过文本因果干预和视觉因果干预消除跨模态偏见和视觉干扰。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试上验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预提升了长时动作识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中具有潜力，但高维和光谱冗余特性使其空间和光谱信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个显微高光谱图像数据集上，分割性能显著优于现有方法，DSC提升超过5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse通过高效的跨维度融合，显著提升了高光谱图像的分割效果。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于投影的点云分割方法采用固定视角的投影，导致投影多样性不足且计算冗余，限制了点云感知能力和效率。

Method: 设计了一种视点依赖投影（VDP）框架，通过数据驱动的投影生成自适应射线，并引入颜色正则化优化框架，以最大化2D空间利用率。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中取得了竞争性结果，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP提供了一种资源高效的语义理解解决方案，通过轻量级投影实现了高效的点云分割。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法在病理图像中可能忽略复杂的领域特征，且数据效率低，需要大量计算资源。

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0通过全切片级别的监督学习，直接优化补丁级表示，提高了数据效率。

Result: 仅使用37k全切片图像训练，EXAONE Path 2.0在10种生物标志物预测任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0展示了全切片监督在病理学中的潜力，显著提升了数据效率和性能。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法在密集标注难以获取的场景中具有潜在的研究价值，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

Result: 在7-Scenes基准测试中，配准召回率提升7%以上。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散先验和可微分设计，显著改进了跨模态配准性能。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Result: SPGD显著提升了生成稳定性，在多种恢复任务中实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理技术有效解决了扩散模型中的不稳定性问题，提升了图像恢复效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average

Conclusion: FlexGaussian高效灵活，适用于移动设备，代码即将开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the

### [44] [Text-promptable Object Counting via Quantity Awareness Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06679)
*Miaojing Shi,Xiaowen Zhang,Zijie Yue,Yong Luo,Cairong Zhao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QUANet提出了一种新的数量导向文本提示和视觉-文本数量对齐损失，以增强模型的数量感知能力，并通过双流自适应计数解码器提升密度图预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本提示中仅包含对象类别信息，不足以让模型在计数任务中准确区分对象数量。

Method: 引入数量导向文本提示和视觉-文本数量对齐损失；提出双流自适应计数解码器（Transformer流、CNN流和T2C适配器）和跨流数量排序损失。

Result: 在FSC-147、CARPK、PUCPR+和ShanghaiTech等基准测试中表现出强大的零样本类无关计数泛化能力。

Conclusion: QUANet通过数量感知和双流解码器设计，显著提升了文本可提示对象计数任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音乐到舞蹈视频的转换问题，通过捕捉空间和时间维度的依赖关系，生成更自然的舞蹈动作。

Method: 1. 音乐到骨架转换：使用STGM块构建骨架序列；2. 骨架到视频转换：采用自监督正则化网络生成视频。

Result: 实验表明STG-Mamba优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STG-Mamba在音乐到舞蹈视频合成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the
music-guided dance video synthesis task, i.e., to translate the input music to
a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings:
music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,
along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new
skeleton-to-video translation dataset from the Internet, containing 54,944
video clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STG-Mamba achieves
significantly better results than existing methods.

### [47] [A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719)
*Zhenyang Liu,Sixiao Zheng,Siyu Chen,Cairong Zhao,Longfei Liang,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SpatialReasoner的框架，通过结合大语言模型（LLM）驱动的空间推理和视觉属性增强的分层特征场，解决了开放词汇3D视觉定位中空间关系推理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇3D视觉定位在自主导航、机器人技术和增强现实等应用中至关重要，但现有方法在语言查询中处理空间关系（如“椅子上的书”）时表现不佳。

Method: SpatialReasoner通过微调LLM来捕捉语言查询中的空间关系，并构建视觉属性增强的分层特征场，结合CLIP特征和SAM提取的掩码，实现目标实例的定位。

Result: 实验表明，该框架可以无缝集成到不同的神经表示中，显著优于基线模型，并提升了空间推理能力。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner通过结合语言和视觉属性的推理，有效解决了3D视觉定位中的空间关系问题，为实际应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手语视频与文本表示之间的差异问题，避免传统方法依赖注释的局限性。

Method: 分层提取帧、片段和视频级特征，并与伪注释和口语对齐。

Result: 实验显示BLEU-4和ROUGE分数提升，同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 分层预训练策略有效提升手语翻译性能，无需依赖传统注释。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了医学图像异常检测的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半导体制造等高精度工业场景中，缺乏专用数据集阻碍了复杂过程建模与预测的研究。

Method: 构建CHDL数据集，并提出DIFFUMA模型，结合Mamba模块和扩散模块以捕捉全局时序和局部空间细节。

Result: DIFFUMA在CHDL上表现优异，MSE降低39%，SSIM提升至0.988，并在自然现象数据集上泛化良好。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了新的SOTA模型，还为工业AI研究提供了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示复杂度的自适应缓存方法（PCA缓存）和动态CFG缓存（DynCFGCache），显著提升了视频生成的推理速度，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成中的推理速度是主要瓶颈，固定频率的缓存机制在复杂场景中效果不佳，手动调整阈值效率低且不鲁棒。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示的复杂度自动调整缓存阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出建模；引入DynCFGCache动态选择CFG输出。

Result: 实验显示方法显著加速（如Wan2.1模型2.79倍速度提升），且保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和DynCFGCache有效解决了视频生成中的速度与质量平衡问题。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

Motivation: 满语作为濒危语言，对早期现代东亚历史研究至关重要，但缺乏有效的OCR系统处理真实历史文档。

Method: 研究通过参数高效训练，在6万张合成满语单词图像上微调了三个开源视觉语言模型（LLaMA-3.2-11B、Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Qwen2.5-VL-3B）。

Result: LLaMA-3.2-11B在合成数据上表现优异（98.3%单词准确率），在真实手写文档上保持93.1%准确率，远超传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为濒危语言OCR提供了可迁移框架，降低了技术和经济门槛，助力历史学和语言学研究者处理历史档案。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing
resources. Code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠、适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Motivation: 现有基于sRGB和HSV颜色空间的低光图像增强方法存在颜色偏差、亮度伪影和噪声问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HVI颜色空间，结合HV颜色图和可学习强度以减少噪声；设计HVI-CIDNet+网络，利用预训练视觉语言模型提取上下文知识，并通过Prior-guided Attention Block和Region Refinement Block优化内容恢复和颜色校正。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上，HVI-CIDNet+优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色偏差和噪声问题，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Result: 在经典力学场景（如弹簧-质量、摆锤和抛体运动）中成功恢复真实解析方程，并优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了生成视频的物理对齐性，无需微调现有模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D2I的框架，通过规则格式奖励增强多模态LLM的理解和推理能力，无需额外标注和复杂奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本高的问题，避免依赖额外数据标注和复杂奖励。

Method: 提出D2I框架，训练时采用深思熟虑的推理策略，评估时转为直觉推理，仅通过规则格式奖励增强模态对齐。

Result: D2I在领域内和领域外基准测试中均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: D2I展示了格式奖励在提升多模态LLM可迁移推理能力中的作用，并为训练和测试阶段推理深度的解耦提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Method: 训练稀疏ViT，每个类别对应一个[CLS]令牌，采用随机掩码策略促进令牌与类别关联，推理时聚合自注意力图生成伪掩码。

Result: 在两个标准基准和三个专用数据集上表现优异，生成的伪掩码可用于训练分割模型，性能接近全监督模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过ViT的自注意力图实现高效弱监督分割，显著减少对精细标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

TL;DR: IAP是一种新型对抗补丁攻击框架，通过感知感知定位和扰动优化生成高度不可见的对抗补丁，显著提升隐蔽性和攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标攻击场景下表现不佳或生成的补丁缺乏上下文一致性，容易被人类或自动防御系统检测到。

Method: IAP结合类定位和敏感度图选择补丁位置，并通过感知感知正则化对抗损失和颜色恒常性梯度更新优化扰动。

Result: 在多种图像基准和模型架构上，IAP在目标攻击中表现优异，同时显著提升补丁的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: IAP不仅对人类高度不可见，还能有效绕过多种先进补丁防御系统。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

years, our ongoing research with over 400 participants representing diverse
ethnicities, genders, and age groups were regularly assessed using a variety of
biometric tools and techniques at the controlled testing facilities. Our
findings are based on the General Data Protection Regulation-compliant local

show that these scores fluctuate more significantly between individual days
than over the entire measurement period. These findings highlight the
importance of testing biometric characteristics of the same individuals over a

Result: 实验表明，该方法在雷达全景分割任务上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemRaFiner通过优化雷达点云处理，提升了自动驾驶场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法依赖DINO的全局表示，导致区分性和泛化性之间的固有权衡。APL旨在通过部分表示解决这一问题。

Method: APL利用共享可学习的部分查询和DINO部分先验生成对象部分及其对应关系，并提出all-min对比损失学习区分性和泛化性兼具的部分表示。

Result: APL显著提升了GCD框架在细粒度数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分发现和学习，有效平衡了GCD任务中的区分性和泛化性，无需额外标注即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

Motivation: 现有书法数据集稀缺且缺乏属性信息，限制了书法研究的深入发展。

Method: 构建包含7,765类329,715个书法字符样本的MCCD数据集，并基于字体风格、朝代和书法家属性提取子集。

Result: 实验表明，书法字符的复杂笔画结构和属性间的相互作用增加了准确识别的难度。

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为书法研究及相关领域提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 研究表明，前哥伦布时期人类通过促进棕榈树增殖影响了植被，留下了持久的生态足迹，为整合人工智能与生态考古数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Method: 提出CheXPO策略：1) 合成多任务胸部X光视觉指令数据集进行监督微调；2) 通过置信度分析和相似性检索扩展困难样本；3) 使用反事实推理提供细粒度临床偏好。

Result: 实验显示，CheXPO仅用5%的监督微调样本即可实现8.93%的相对性能提升，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现出跨领域的泛化能力（DSC 0.88-0.86），而直肠和CTV的性能依赖于领域。剂量累积显示83.3%的患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现合理，初步验证了其在评估治疗合规性方面的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Conclusion: FreeTTA通过显式建模测试数据分布，无需训练或历史数据，显著提升了测试时适应的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Result: 在模拟恶劣天气的OPV2V数据集上，DenoiseCP-Net实现了高精度去噪，带宽需求降低23.6%，检测精度不变且延迟减少。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

*Qilong Xing,Zikai Song,Youjia Zhang,Na Feng,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种知识驱动的框架MCA-RG，通过将视觉特征与医学概念对齐，提升放射学报告生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在放射学报告生成中难以准确映射病理和解剖特征到文本描述，且特征提取语义不明确。

Method: MCA-RG利用病理和解剖概念库对齐视觉特征，采用对比学习和匹配损失优化特征，并通过特征门控机制过滤低质量特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现出色。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

<details>

Motivation: NSCLC患者免疫治疗的精准预后对个性化治疗至关重要，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效的多模态特征融合方法。

Method: 构建了包含3D CT图像和临床记录的大规模数据集，并提出基于跨模态掩码学习的特征融合框架，包括Slice-Depth Transformer和基于图的Transformer。

Result: 该方法在多模态整合中表现优异，超越了现有方法，为NSCLC预后模型设定了新基准。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效融合多模态数据，显著提升了NSCLC患者的生存预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Method: 使用视觉特征提取器生成补丁嵌入，通过深度嵌入聚类和注意力机制去除冗余补丁，构建图神经网络捕获局部和全局上下文，结合语言模型生成描述。

Result: 在BreakHis和PatchGastric数据集上，分类F1得分为0.934，AUC为0.963；描述生成BLEU-4得分为0.811，METEOR得分为0.569。

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap在病理图像分类和描述生成任务中优于现有方法，为基于显微镜的患者诊断提供了可靠高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该方法为从H&E图像中高效预测细胞组成提供了一种轻量级解决方案，避免了昂贵的空间转录组学实验。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS、时间戳和食物信息）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并引入新数据集ACETADA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），忽略了其他LLMs，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过整合GPS、时间戳和食物信息等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如Chain-of-Thought），评估八种LMMs的性能。

Result: 智能整合元数据显著降低了营养值预测的平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算Laplace-Beltrami谱的效率较低，尤其在处理大规模CAD机械零件数据库或频繁质量检测时。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率和主曲率等丰富网格特征，预测Laplace-Beltrami谱。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比线性FEM计算时间减少约5倍，同时保持竞争力精度。

Conclusion: Laplace-Beltrami谱是可学习的，提出的深度学习框架为高效计算提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Result: 在新构建的数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估的相关性上优于现有方法，能够捕捉细粒度的实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的评估方法，有望替代主观评估。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Conclusion: VLV框架通过有效利用预训练组件，实现了高效、低成本的图像描述模型，为视觉语言任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP作为视觉编码器在捕捉全局信息时可能忽略细粒度细节，限制了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答中的表现。

Method: 研究扩散模型的内部表征，发现其具有丰富的语义和图像-文本对齐能力，并探索如何将其与大语言模型对齐，同时提出泄漏现象的缓解策略。

Result: 通过融合CLIP和扩散模型特征，在通用VQA和专业MLLM基准测试中表现出色，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的视觉任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在视觉理解中具有潜力，特别是在需要细粒度细节的任务中，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

### [86] [Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373)
*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEWI是一个基于Unity开发的3D多人模拟工具，用于模拟战场医疗后送网络，提升学员在离线规划和在线决策中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏在课堂环境中模拟医疗后送网络并评估规划和决策能力的工具。

Method: 开发MEWI模拟器，模拟战场约束和不确定性，并在两个实战场景中测试学员表现。

Result: MEWI显著提升了学员对医疗后送经验的学习和协作决策能力。

Conclusion: MEWI是医疗教育高保真培训工具的重要进步，为联合部队的医疗后送教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

### [87] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)，一种新型的提示表示方法，旨在解决现有框架在复杂性和灵活性上的不足，通过将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程框架要么过于复杂，要么缺乏灵活性，难以支持高级代理编程，因此需要一种新的方法来简化提示表示和调优。

Method: 提出PDL，一种声明式语言，抽象化提示的组合和优化，支持手动和自动调优，同时整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。

Result: 通过一个合规代理的案例研究，PDL的调优使性能提升高达4倍，优于传统固定模式。

Conclusion: PDL通过声明式表示和优化，显著提升了提示工程的效率和性能，为复杂代理编程提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

### [88] [Jolting Technologies: Superexponential Acceleration in AI Capabilities and Implications for AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06398)
*David Orban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究验证了AI能力发展的超指数增长假说，提出了理论框架和检测方法，并通过模拟验证，为未来实证研究提供了工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI能力发展的加速模式及其对通用人工智能（AGI）出现的潜在影响。

Method: 开发理论框架，利用蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法，分析缩短的想法到行动间隔和迭代改进的复合效应。

Result: 通过模拟验证了检测方法的有效性，为未来实证研究提供了数学基础。

Conclusion: 研究为理解AI发展轨迹及其对AGI的潜在影响提供了理论支持，对研究和政策制定具有启示意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

### [89] [Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文证明了q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，而p-辩证系统又比d-辩证系统更强，揭示了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正中的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辩证系统是为了建模代理如何更新知识库以追求一致性，并统一动态信念管理的计算框架。

Method: 区分了三种辩证系统模型（d-、p-、q-），并通过理论证明比较它们的表达能力。

Result: q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，p-辩证系统又严格强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 反例和矛盾在信念修正中具有互补作用，这对数学家和研究社区的推理过程有重要意义。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

### [90] [SCC-recursiveness in infinite argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06852)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架中，提出了两种方法，并评估了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC递归语义在有限论证框架中有效，但在无限框架中因基础性问题无法可靠推广，因此需要扩展方法。

Method: 提出了两种扩展SCC递归语义到无限框架的方法，并系统评估其性能，包括方向性等标准。

Result: 发现方向性在一般情况下失败，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究结果推动了无限论证理论的发展，为处理无界或演化领域的推理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

### [91] [Scaling Towards the Information Boundary of Instruction Set: InfinityInstruct-Subject Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06968)
*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，通过分层标注、种子选择、数据合成和模型诊断生成高质量指令数据，提升了模型的指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集的覆盖范围和深度不足，导致模型在复杂指令和罕见领域任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出一个包含分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和针对性数据生成的闭环框架。

Result: 构建了包含150万指令的高质量数据集InfinityInstruct-Subject，实验证明其能有效提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为指令数据集的高效持续进化提供了理论和实践基础，从数量扩展转向质量提升。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

*Jieren Deng,Aleksandar Cvetkovic,Pak Kiu Chung,Dragomir Yankov,Chiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态旅行规划系统，通过三个协作代理解决传统系统的不足，显著提升了查询解析、导航精度和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对现实世界的复杂性和突发变化，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 提出三个协作代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间定位和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（提供精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG技术应对行程中断）。

Result: 系统在查询解析、导航精度和抗干扰能力方面表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等多种应用中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

TL;DR: FR3E框架通过结构化探索提升LLM推理能力，解决RLVR的不稳定探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，识别高不确定性决策点，进行针对性探索以构建语义基础反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E提升训练稳定性、生成更长且连贯的响应，并增加完全正确轨迹比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过结构化探索有效提升LLM推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

### [95] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)
*Neil Rathi,Dan Jurafsky,Kaitlyn Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在过度自信和用户过度依赖的问题，尤其是在不同语言中表达不确定性的方式差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在全球范围内的安全性，关注其在不同语言中的校准问题，避免用户因模型的过度自信而过度依赖。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLMs生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对模型生成内容的依赖行为。

Result: LLMs在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但不同语言中表达不确定性的方式不同；用户在所有语言中均对自信生成内容过度依赖，但依赖行为因语言而异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准具有挑战性，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ETT的方法，通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的计算和内存开销随序列长度呈二次增长，限制了其在长序列处理中的应用。

Method: ETT方法通过将输入上下文分块为重叠的小子序列，并在测试时高效微调模型参数，实现上下文长度的扩展。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 研究发现仅微调FFN的第二层比全微调更有效，进一步提升了模型准确率。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式、分布和接地语义理论各有优缺点，需要一种方法结合三者优势，提升语言模型的表达能力。

Method: 回顾文献，结合认知科学理论，并通过小规模实验验证“词作为分类器”模型的可行性。

Result: “词作为分类器”模型在交互对话中表现良好，并能融入形式化和分布化语言模型。

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型是统一三种语义理论的有潜力路径，未来可进一步扩展为统一语义模型。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了MorphScore以支持70种语言，并探讨了分词器质量与下游任务性能的关系，发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估分词器质量的重要性，尤其是其是否保留语言上有意义的子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，并分析其与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: 形态对齐对模型性能的方差解释有限。

Conclusion: 形态对齐单独不足以衡量与模型性能相关的分词器质量。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

TL;DR: 论文展示了句法对象上的头部函数如何将岩浆结构扩展为超岩浆结构，并探讨了其在句法生成系统中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数学结构（如超岩浆和彩色操作数）形式化句法理论中的核心概念，如头部、补足语、指示语等，以及句法移动的规则。

Method: 使用超岩浆结构和彩色操作数理论，将句法生成系统建模为彩色操作数的生成系统，并探讨其与句法移动规则的关系。

Result: 研究表明，句法生成和移动规则可以通过彩色操作数统一描述，且超岩浆结构与彩色操作数之间存在等价性。

Conclusion: 通过数学结构形式化句法理论，为句法生成和移动提供了统一的框架，并揭示了其内在的数学性质。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

*Zeming Chen,Angelika Romanou,Gail Weiss,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK是一种高效的长上下文推理方法，通过轻量级适配器在测试时编码上下文，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文推理中信息提取困难及传统元学习方法内存消耗大的问题。

Method: 采用双嵌套优化循环，内循环编码上下文到低秩适配器，外循环学习利用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，性能提升显著，对小模型效果尤为明显。

Conclusion: PERK在推理时内存效率高，适用于长上下文场景。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REFORM的自我改进奖励建模框架，通过奖励引导的解码发现奖励模型的失败模式，并利用生成的对抗样本增强训练数据，从而提高模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好的复杂性和数据集的有限覆盖，奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效。现有方法依赖先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种不依赖偏好分布的方法，通过奖励引导的解码发现失败模式，并引入REFORM框架，利用对抗样本增强训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了奖励质量，并在下游策略训练中表现良好。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自我改进增强了奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，消除了虚假相关性。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

TL;DR: 通过字典学习和稀疏自编码器分解LLM，提取单义特征，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM被视为黑箱，缺乏可解释性，影响信任度和性能优化。

Method: 采用字典学习和稀疏自编码器分解LLM，提取单义特征并自动优化提示。

Result: 显著提升数学推理和隐喻检测等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: LLM分解方法有效提升模型可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政策语言的演变对评估全球应对复杂挑战（如气候变化）至关重要，但传统方法耗时且难以捕捉复杂关联性。

Method: 采用动态嵌入主题模型（DETM）分析UNFCCC政策决策语料库（1995-2023），捕捉主题的时序动态。

Result: 模型揭示了从早期关注温室气体和国际公约到近期聚焦实施、技术合作、能力建设、融资和全球协议的转变。

Conclusion: DETM是分析全球政策话语演变的可扩展且有效的工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

TL;DR: PAPO扩展了GRPO，通过引入隐式感知损失（KL散度），显著提升了多模态推理任务的性能，尤其在视觉依赖任务中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR在多模态推理任务中表现不佳，主要问题在于视觉输入的感知误差。

Method: 提出PAPO，通过隐式感知损失（KL散度）优化GRPO目标，无需额外数据或外部奖励模型。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中整体提升4.4%，视觉依赖任务提升8.0%，感知误差减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为RLVR引入了感知感知监督，为视觉基础推理的RL框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SCATE框架的时间归一化方法，通过代码生成任务实现，利用大语言模型生成可执行代码，并通过数据增强提升小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ISO-TimeML的方法表达能力有限，难以处理复杂时间表达式，如组合式、事件相关和多跨度表达式。

Method: 将时间归一化任务重新定义为基于SCATE框架的代码生成任务，开发了可执行的SCATE Python库，并利用大语言模型生成代码，通过数据增强生成大规模标注数据。

Result: 实验表明，基于增强数据训练的小模型性能优于大语言模型，实现了高效、准确且可解释的时间归一化。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间归一化提供了新的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了线性注意力机制在长序列处理中的性能，发现混合架构中线性注意力的选择对召回性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时面临二次复杂度和内存问题，线性注意力机制虽能缓解但召回性能有限，因此需要研究混合架构中线性注意力的选择。

Method: 系统评估了多种线性注意力模型（包括向量递归和门控机制），训练并开源了72个模型，涵盖六种线性注意力变体和五种混合比例。

Result: 研究发现，优秀的独立线性模型在混合架构中未必表现优异，召回性能在增加全注意力层后显著提升，特别是在3:1比例以下。

Conclusion: 选择性门控、分层递归和可控遗忘对混合模型至关重要，推荐使用HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet，线性与全注意力比例在3:1到6:1之间。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Motivation: 确保LLM在人类-AI交互中的透明性、信任和安全性，尤其是在高风险应用中。

Method: 提出了一种通过扰动和越狱方法攻击口头置信度分数的框架，并测试了多种提示策略、模型规模和应用领域。

Result: 攻击显著危害了置信度估计，导致频繁的答案变化，且现有防御技术大多无效或适得其反。

Conclusion: 迫切需要设计更鲁棒的置信度表达机制，因为即使是微小的语义保留修改也可能导致误导性置信度。

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨语言双关语翻译的长期难题，弥补翻译研究与计算语言学之间的空白。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：基线模型建立、引导思维链管道、多代理生成-判别框架。

Result: 在CLEF JOKER 2025竞赛中取得第一和第二名。

Conclusion: 通过语言学技术提升双关语翻译，展示了语言模型在语义模糊性和文化意识方面的潜力。

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在深层存在冗余，但浅层缓存减少效果不足，且相似性高，因此需要一种平衡的方法。

Method: SpindleKV结合注意力权重（深层）和代码本替换（浅层），学习相似性和合并策略。

Result: 在两个基准测试和三种LLM上，SpindleKV优于基线方法，减少KV缓存同时保持或提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SpindleKV有效平衡了浅层和深层KV缓存减少，解决了GQA问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Motivation: 解决行为金融中LLMs与投资者从众行为对齐的挑战，尤其是真实数据稀缺导致SFT的高成本和隐私问题。

Method: 利用理论解构建SFT数据集InvestAlign，训练LLM代理InvestAgent，对比真实数据验证效果。

Result: InvestAlign生成的数据使LLM参数收敛更快，InvestAgent在简单和复杂投资问题中更接近真实用户数据。

Conclusion: InvestAlign是解决复杂投资问题和LLMs对齐的有效方法，具有高效学习潜力。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 该方法为工业合同信息抽取任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 研究人类与LLMs交互中的事实性、逻辑性和结构性错误（无效化），探索如何通过网络模型提高可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种基于漂移、自我修复、虚构和外部检测的数学模型，并开发了FOO算法以实现同行评审。

Result: 仅依赖漂移和自我修复的网络稳定在较低错误率；加入虚构后错误率升高；引入同行评审可转向真相主导状态。

Conclusion: 可靠性源于将不完美模型连接成相互监督的网络，而非单一模型的完美化。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率达94.1%，合成充分性达85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成相结合显著提升了食品QA的可靠性与多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale

40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and

Result: SambaY显著提升了解码效率，保持了线性预填充时间复杂度，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构在性能和效率上均优于基线模型，展示了大规模计算下的优越可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

Conclusion: FuDoBa提供高效、可解释的表示学习方法，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）和审查协议加速数据提取过程，以减轻研究人员的负担。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率较高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据准确率较低（9.6%和15.8%）；总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数较低。

Conclusion: 建议在更多LLM和审查情境下进行性能评估，并报告LLM表现，以优化数据提取和审查协议。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架在临床文本生成中表现出高效性和可靠性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

*Sunwoo Kim,Haneul Yoo,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在输出层概率动态上对确定和不确定预测的处理方式相似，不确定性并未显著影响推理动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何内部表示和处理预测，以检测不确定性和防止幻觉。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹，比较确定和不确定预测的动态。

Result: 确定和不确定预测的轨迹在置信度上表现出相似的突然增加，但更优秀的模型可能学会不同处理不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了简单方法检测不确定性的可行性，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

Method: 比较随机和fastText嵌入（静态和微调），使用不同维度和模型（CBOW/Skip-gram），并测试CNN和CNN-KAN作为基线。还研究了MLP和KAN分类头。

Result: KAConvText-MLP结合微调fastText嵌入表现最佳，准确率分别为91.23%（仇恨言论）、92.66%（新闻分类）和99.82%（语言识别）。

Conclusion: KAConvText在句子分类任务中表现出色，尤其是结合微调嵌入和MLP分类头时，同时KAN分类头增强了可解释性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法在多语言场景下依赖专有模型或大量训练数据，成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用基于检查表直觉的无训练框架CE-Judge，利用开源模型进行多语言评估。

Result: 在多种语言和基准数据集上，CE-Judge表现优于基线模型，与GPT-4相当。

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言文本评估解决方案。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

TL;DR: 研究验证了领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）在小型大语言模型（sLLMs）中的有效性，证明其能显著提升目标领域性能，同时保持通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）为企业应用提供了机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此小型LLMs（sLLMs）成为实用替代方案。然而，领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）在商业应用中的实用性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过在不同基础模型和服务领域应用DACP方法，进行广泛实验和实际评估。

Result: 实验表明，应用DACP的sLLMs在目标领域性能显著提升，同时保留了通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP为sLLMs提供了一种成本高效且可扩展的企业级部署解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，适用于多种系统和领域，显著提升了动态系统建模的效率。

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Motivation: 现有顺序和并行推理方法存在效率低或缺乏协调的问题，需设计更灵活的推理框架。

Method: 提出语义熵（SE）作为评估并行模型响应质量的指标，实现动态控制和早期终止。

Result: 语义熵与准确性呈强负相关，能有效指示推理质量。

Conclusion: 协作推理框架结合两种推理优势，SE为动态控制提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重排序，难以满足复杂查询（如多跳问答）的信息需求。

Method: 提出SETR方法，通过Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

Abstract: AI evaluations have become critical tools for assessing large language model

months of maintaining $inspect\_evals$, an open-source repository of 70+
community-contributed AI evaluations. We identify key challenges in
implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community
contributions, (2) statistical methodologies for optimal resampling and
cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and
community coordination beyond traditional software development practices.

TL;DR: SCoRE是一个模块化、低成本的句子级关系抽取系统，结合对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器，适应性强且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低监督环境下知识图谱（KG）增强的需求，提供适应性强、噪声鲁棒的关系抽取（RE）解决方案。

Method: 采用监督对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器进行多标签分类，无需微调预训练语言模型（PLM）。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于或匹配现有方法，显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: SCoRE凭借高效、模块化和可扩展性，成为现实世界RE应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

Motivation: GUI代理与个人设备的紧密集成带来了安全风险，尤其是后门攻击等威胁尚未充分研究。本文旨在揭示视觉接地过程中的漏洞。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过在视觉接地预训练阶段注入中毒数据，误导代理将文本计划映射到触发位置而非目标位置。

Result: 实验表明，仅需5%的中毒数据和隐蔽的视觉触发器即可有效劫持视觉接地，且攻击可泛化到下游任务和不同GUI环境。

Conclusion: 研究强调了GUI代理中后门攻击风险的紧迫性，呼吁进一步研究以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Result: 在三个数据集上优于现有零样本方法，泛化性强。

Conclusion: MIND为有害模因检测提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Conclusion: 多被告多指控场景对法律判决预测模型提出了更高要求，模型性能差异显著，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，评估Llama 3和GPT-4o模型在预测导师策略和学生表现上的能力。

Result: 即使是最先进的大语言模型也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来预测导师策略及其对学生的影响。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Conclusion: SAGA方法有效提升了代码生成评估的可靠性，为自动化对抗测试和自适应基准集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Conclusion: 提出了评估RAG查询鲁棒性的框架，并为实践者提供了基于实验结果的改进建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

Abstract: We present FRaN-X, a Framing and Narratives Explorer that automatically
detects entity mentions and classifies their narrative roles directly from raw
text. FRaN-X comprises a two-stage system that combines sequence labeling with
fine-grained role classification to reveal how entities are portrayed as
protagonists, antagonists, or innocents, using a unique taxonomy of 22
fine-grained roles nested under these three main categories. The system
supports five languages (Bulgarian, English, Hindi, Russian, and Portuguese)
and two domains (the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Climate Change). It provides
an interactive web interface for media analysts to explore and compare framing
across different sources, tackling the challenge of automatically detecting and
labeling how entities are framed. Our system allows end users to focus on a
single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained
models are licensed under an MIT License. FRaN-X is publicly accessible at

TL;DR: FlexOlmo是一种新型语言模型，支持分布式训练和数据灵活推理，通过MoE架构实现独立训练和灵活集成，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在封闭数据集上训练语言模型时的数据共享和访问控制问题，同时提升模型性能。

Method: 采用MoE架构，每个专家在封闭数据集上独立训练，通过域感知路由集成，无需联合训练。

Result: 在31个任务上评估，性能平均提升41%，优于现有模型合并方法10.1%。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为敏感数据行业提供解决方案，支持数据本地化和细粒度访问控制。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Result: 在五个对话搜索数据集上的评估表明，统一模型能同时提升两项任务性能，并优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 统一密集检索和响应生成的方法能有效提升对话搜索系统的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在离散数据生成中展现出潜力，尤其是在并行生成效率上，但在生成质量上仍需改进，支持未来非自回归语言生成的研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

*Xuyang Chen,Chong Huang,Daquan Feng,Lei Luo,Yao Sun,Xiang-Gen Xia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义自校正的视频传输框架（SSCV-G），通过超精细比特率控制和多用户强化学习优化，显著提升了无人机视频流的带宽效率和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时无人机视频流在紧急响应等场景中至关重要，但面临带宽限制、延迟波动和高丢包率等挑战。

Method: 采用语义编码和自适应传输策略，结合时空视觉变换器（ST-ViT）和多用户近端策略优化（MUPPO）强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，SSCV-G在编码效率、带宽适应性和丢包鲁棒性上优于现有视频编解码器，MUPPO优化进一步提升了用户体验。

Conclusion: SSCV-G和MUPPO的结合为无人机视频流提供了高效、自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video streaming is essential for
time-sensitive applications, including remote surveillance, emergency response,
and environmental monitoring. However, it faces challenges such as limited
bandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues,
we propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with
ultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded
into a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a
subset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling
fine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the
receiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame
joint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and
inter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network
conditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO)
reinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource
allocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of
Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency,
bandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed
MUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 多表征方法具有实用性和资源效率，适用于医学数据及其他领域，展现了广泛的潜在影响。

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the
extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the
performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of
data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these
features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we
introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation
integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from
distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network,
self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach
yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single
representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate
the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset,
underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in
various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of
polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other
domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

optimize it in a more interpretable manner. Our approach incorporates a
simplified model for light representation and demonstrates the potential of the
Gaussian Splatting rendering engine for the photometric stereo problem.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical
image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical
image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In
this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a
two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically
designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space
model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse,
adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts
(SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to
specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second
stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group
information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design,
combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves
generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art
results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging
modalities and data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CCELLA仅支持AxT2序列、未研究域偏移及未关注病理结果的问题，提升临床实用性。

Method: 扩展CCELLA以生成bpMRI（包括AxT2、HighB和ADC），研究域适应策略。

Result: CCELLA++在HighB和ADC序列上表现优于CCELLA，分类器预训练性能优于真实数据。

Conclusion: 合成bpMRI可提升分类器泛化性能，未来需优化多序列训练和质量评估。

Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity
challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image
interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection
performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the
axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional
domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We
propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.
Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI
(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)
and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was
investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data
from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively
smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:
CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063
respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with
CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation
scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below
50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by
our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance
beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek
to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training,
and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed
CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain
adaptation with a limited target institution dataset. Our code is available at

Result: Speckle2Self在模拟和真实超声图像上表现优于传统滤波器和先进学习方法，并展示了跨设备的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Speckle2Self为超声图像斑点噪声提供了一种有效的自监督解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic
interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D)
representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a
technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep
learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B
vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four
advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0,
and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address
the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label
Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and
class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced
techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined
through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance
(AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system
demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in
clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer
detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

Conclusion: TfeNet通过创新的卷积设计和特征融合策略，显著提升了气道分割的准确性和连续性。

Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is
therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the
clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional
neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway
segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for
conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine
airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address
this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,
named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation
that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling
positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then
represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular
feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and
residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway
structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two
datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed
TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions
compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest
overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,
Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung
fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at

Result: 在标准数据集上，SimCortex显著减少了表面重叠和自相交，同时保持了几何精度。

Conclusion: SimCortex在皮层表面重建中优于现有方法，解决了拓扑问题并提升了准确性。

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods
have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological
requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and
topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a
deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces
(left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while
preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into
a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate
subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve
as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic
deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via
scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving
transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and
self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex
dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing
current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

Motivation: 当前深度学习在脑肿瘤检测中面临高精度和计算效率的挑战，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated
detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However,
achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In
this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed
to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates
the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are
EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve
generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture
enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which
incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly
reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the
ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50
architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned
for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for
training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and
avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures
that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.
Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate
that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods
in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational
efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of
88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates
the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting
radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.

Motivation: 解决CFD模拟成本高、无法实时应用的问题，为基于模型的温度控制提供支持。

Method: 使用隐式大涡模拟CFD数据训练CNN模型，并引入基于相关性的缩放方法扩展到更高雷诺数。

Result: 模型在验证数据上表现出高精度（五乘一阵列误差低于2%，三乘三阵列误差低于0.6%），实验验证了预测能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为先进热管理应用中的模型控制策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study presents a surrogate model designed to predict the Nusselt number
distribution in an enclosed impinging jet arrays, where each jet function
independently and where jets can be transformed from inlets to outlets, leading
to a vast number of possible flow arrangements. While computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their
cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control.
To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the
Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large
eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re < 2,000). We train two
distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one
for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to
extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a
correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a
normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one
surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental
validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a
foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management
applications.

dimensions vital for co-creative processes. This gap leaves artists,
particularly amateurs seeking to develop expertise, underserved. To bridge
this, we introduce MixAssist, a novel audio-language dataset capturing the
situated, multi-turn dialogue between expert and amateur music producers during
collaborative mixing sessions. Comprising 431 audio-grounded conversational

provides a unique resource for training and evaluating audio-language models
that can comprehend and respond to the complexities of real-world music
production dialogues. Our evaluations, including automated LLM-as-a-judge
assessments and human expert comparisons, demonstrate that fine-tuning models
such as Qwen-Audio on MixAssist can yield promising results, with Qwen
significantly outperforming other tested models in generating helpful,
contextually relevant mixing advice. By focusing on co-creative instruction
grounded in audio context, MixAssist enables the development of intelligent AI

Abstract: The recent surge in State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the emergence of
Mamba, has established them as strong alternatives or complementary modules to
Transformers across diverse domains. In this work, we aim to explore the
potential of Mamba-based architectures for text-to-music generation. We adopt
discrete tokens of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) as the modeling
representation and empirically find that a single-layer codebook can capture
semantic information in music. Motivated by this observation, we focus on
modeling a single-codebook representation and adapt SiMBA, originally designed
as a Mamba-based encoder, to function as a decoder for sequence modeling. We
compare its performance against a standard Transformer-based decoder. Our
results suggest that, under limited-resource settings, SiMBA achieves much
faster convergence and generates outputs closer to the ground truth. This
demonstrates the promise of SSMs for efficient and expressive text-to-music
generation. We put audio examples on Github.

Motivation: 语音情感识别在人机交互和人工智能发展中至关重要，但现有研究未能在多个基准数据集上同时评估单一模型。

Method: 使用DCRF-BiLSTM模型识别七种情感，并在五个数据集（RAVDESS、TESS、SAVEE、EmoDB、Crema-D）上进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型在单个数据集上准确率高达97.83%至100%，综合数据集上达98.82%，首次在五个数据集上综合评估，整体准确率达93.76%。

Conclusion: DCRF-BiLSTM模型具有鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于多种语音情感识别任务。

Abstract: Nowadays, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in the field of
human-computer interaction (HCI) and the evolution of artificial intelligence
(AI). Our proposed DCRF-BiLSTM model is used to recognize seven emotions:
neutral, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, and surprise, which are trained on
five datasets: RAVDESS (R), TESS (T), SAVEE (S), EmoDB (E), and Crema-D (C).
The model achieves high accuracy on individual datasets, including 97.83% on
RAVDESS, 97.02% on SAVEE, 95.10% for CREMA-D, and a perfect 100% on both TESS
and EMO-DB. For the combined (R+T+S) datasets, it achieves 98.82% accuracy,
outperforming previously reported results. To our knowledge, no existing study
has evaluated a single SER model across all five benchmark datasets (i.e.,
R+T+S+C+E) simultaneously. In our work, we introduce this comprehensive
combination and achieve a remarkable overall accuracy of 93.76%. These results
confirm the robustness and generalizability of our DCRF-BiLSTM framework across

Result: CNN固定长度窗口AUROC为79.5%，心周期标准化为75.4%；BEATs固定长度窗口为65.7%，心周期标准化为70.1%。

Conclusion: 生理信号约束对模型性能影响显著，CNN更优但变换器效率高，自动化分类系统有望提升心脏诊断。

Abstract: The automated classification of phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings represents a
substantial advancement in cardiovascular diagnostics. This paper presents a
systematic comparison of four distinct models for heart murmur detection: two
specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and two zero-shot universal
audio transformers (BEATs), evaluated using fixed-length and heart cycle
normalization approaches. Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart
cycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is
introduced. The findings indicate the following AUROC values: the CNN model
with fixed-length windowing achieves 79.5%, the CNN model with heart cycle
normalization scores 75.4%, the BEATs transformer with fixed-length windowing
achieves 65.7%, and the BEATs transformer with heart cycle normalization
results in 70.1%.
  The findings indicate that physiological signal constraints, especially those
introduced by different normalization strategies, have a substantial impact on
model performance. The research provides evidence-based guidelines for
architecture selection in clinical settings, emphasizing the need for a balance
between accuracy and computational efficiency. Although specialized CNNs
demonstrate superior performance overall, the zero-shot transformer models may
offer promising efficiency advantages during development, such as faster
training and evaluation cycles, despite their lower classification accuracy.
These findings highlight the potential of automated classification systems to
enhance cardiac diagnostics and improve patient care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波束形成方法计算量大且对声学变化敏感，而深度学习需要大量标注数据且缺乏可解释性。两者在泛化性上均有限。

Method: 提出Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM)模型，自监督生成高分辨率声学映射，适应不同声学条件和麦克风阵列。

Result: 在LOCATA和STARSS基准测试中，LAM性能优于或接近现有监督方法，其声学映射还可提升监督模型的准确性。

Conclusion: LAM结合了传统和深度学习的优势，有望推动自适应高性能声音定位系统的发展。

Abstract: Acoustic mapping techniques have long been used in spatial audio processing
for direction of arrival estimation (DoAE). Traditional beamforming methods for
acoustic mapping, while interpretable, often rely on iterative solvers that can
be computationally intensive and sensitive to acoustic variability. On the
other hand, recent supervised deep learning approaches offer feedforward speed
and robustness but require large labeled datasets and lack interpretability.
Despite their strengths, both methods struggle to consistently generalize
across diverse acoustic setups and array configurations, limiting their broader
applicability. We introduce the Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM) model, a
self-supervised framework that bridges the interpretability of traditional
methods with the adaptability and efficiency of deep learning methods. LAM
generates high-resolution acoustic maps, adapts to varying acoustic conditions,
and operates efficiently across different microphone arrays. We assess its
robustness on DoAE using the LOCATA and STARSS benchmarks. LAM achieves
comparable or superior localization performance to existing supervised methods.
Additionally, we show that LAM's acoustic maps can serve as effective features
for supervised models, further enhancing DoAE accuracy and underscoring its
potential to advance adaptive, high-performance sound localization systems.

Motivation: 现实中的分类问题（如植物识别）通常具有长尾分布，现有方法无法同时保证预测集的小尺寸和良好的类别条件覆盖率。

Method: 1. 提出一种名为“prevalence-adjusted softmax”的分数函数，针对宏覆盖率；2. 提出标签加权共形预测方法，在边际和类别条件共形预测之间插值。

Result: 在Pl@ntNet和iNaturalist两个长尾图像数据集（分别有1,081和8,142类）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法能够在预测集大小和类别条件覆盖率之间实现平滑权衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have
extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be
useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional
coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the
prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify
candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when
applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice
between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good
class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods
with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and
class-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function,
prevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional
coverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal
prediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and
class-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet
and iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes,
respectively.

Method: 结合Caputo和Grünwald-Letnikov导数构建双分数阶特征库，采用两阶段分层分类器定位故障逆变器和IGBT开关，并通过PMR-AT增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FO-MADS是一种成本低、易部署的方案，显著提升了智能微电网的网络安全韧性。

Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same
time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point
instrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under
single-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order
Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency
fault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ
(Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual
fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and
Gr\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and
slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then
pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,
effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened
through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose
attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining
(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a
four-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under
four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0
% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining
96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a
cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the
cyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.

Conclusion: JSA-SPG方法高效且无需发音词典，为跨语言语音识别提供了新思路，并开源了代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated
their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and
information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a
pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech
recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation
lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being
treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a
speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.
To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic
approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM
(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance
particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the
Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are
conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of
phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\% error rate
reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword
or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain
adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms
the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the
G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and
encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG
training code and complete pipeline.

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中均实现了高的一次性成功率，并在长期重复任务中保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RIT的挑战，展示了高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where
a robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a
nut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving
millimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple
repetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce
additional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a
reinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting
module. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather
than the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real
transferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages
real-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and
rotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential
execution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the
wrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high
one-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon
repetitive tasks.

Motivation: 传统导航方法在动态3D环境中表现不足，需结合自然语言理解和视觉感知以提高无人机导航的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: SkyVLN利用大型语言模型（LLMs）解析指令和视觉数据，配备细粒度空间语言化器和历史路径记忆机制，结合NMPC实现动态避障。

Conclusion: SkyVLN为无人机在复杂城市环境中的自主导航提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across
various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper
introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation
(VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in
complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language
instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic
3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal
navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history
path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial
contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The
framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance,
ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our
approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using
AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success
rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.

TL;DR: Q-STAC结合贝叶斯MPC与强化学习，通过SVGD优化控制序列，提升样本效率与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在连续控制任务中数据需求大、规划复杂及安全性不足的问题，同时弥补MPC局部最优和成本函数设计的局限性。

Method: 整合贝叶斯MPC与actor-critic强化学习，利用SVGD优化控制序列，以Q值替代显式成本函数设计。

Result: 在2D导航和机器人操作任务中，Q-STAC表现出更高的样本效率、鲁棒性和最优性。

Conclusion: Q-STAC成功结合了MPC的可解释性与强化学习的表达能力，同时提升了性能与安全性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous
control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with
complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during
operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and
constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions
and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided
STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework
that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic
reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent
(SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values
as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while
leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure
control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D
navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves
superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of
policy distributions. Experiment videos are available on our website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于成功率指标难以复现且无法捕捉机器人运动轨迹的复杂性，评估人形机器人性能具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了Neural Meta Evaluator (NeME)，一种深度学习模型，通过机器人关节轨迹分类动作，作为比较控制策略性能的元评估器。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法比基线更符合机器人的实际成功率，提供了可复现且系统化的评估手段。

Conclusion: NeME为复杂人机交互任务中的模仿学习方法提供了一种高效、无人工干预的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

TL;DR: LOVON是一个结合大型语言模型和开放词汇视觉检测的新框架，用于动态环境中长距离物体导航，解决了视觉抖动、盲区等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界中的物体导航对机器人系统是一个挑战，传统方法难以整合开放世界物体检测和高级任务规划。

Method: LOVON结合大型语言模型进行分层任务规划，并采用开放词汇视觉检测模型，设计了视觉稳定化和功能执行逻辑。

Result: 实验表明LOVON能成功完成长序列任务，并在不同机器人上展示了兼容性和即插即用特性。

Conclusion: LOVON为动态环境中的长距离物体导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and
pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to
executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and
high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these
components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex,
long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task
planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective
long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle
real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary
target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering
for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the
robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task
adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,
search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore,
real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and
H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.

Abstract: The increasing interest in research and innovation towards the development of

Conclusion: Gradientsys通过LLM驱动的多智能体编排，展示了高效和透明的调度能力。

Abstract: We present Gradientsys, a next-generation multi-agent scheduling framework
that coordinates diverse specialized AI agents using a typed Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) and a ReAct-based dynamic planning loop. At its core,
Gradientsys employs an LLM-powered scheduler for intelligent one-to-many task
dispatch, enabling parallel execution of heterogeneous agents such as PDF
parsers, web search modules, GUI controllers, and web builders. The framework
supports hybrid synchronous/asynchronous execution, respects agent capacity
constraints, and incorporates a robust retry-and-replan mechanism to handle
failures gracefully. To promote transparency and trust, Gradientsys includes an
observability layer streaming real-time agent activity and intermediate
reasoning via Server-Sent Events (SSE). We offer an architectural overview and
evaluate Gradientsys against existing frameworks in terms of extensibility,
scheduling topology, tool reusability, parallelism, and observability.
Experiments on the GAIA general-assistant benchmark show that Gradientsys
achieves higher task success rates with reduced latency and lower API costs
compared to a MinionS-style baseline, demonstrating the strength of its
LLM-driven multi-agent orchestration.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注视觉层面的可爱，而声音方面的可爱感知研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过四阶段研究（N=512），分析文本转语音和游戏角色声音的基频和共振峰频率调整对可爱感知的影响。

Result: 发现某些声音存在可爱的“甜点”频率，但效果有限，且某些声音存在天花板效应。

Conclusion: 初步验证了可爱声音模型，并提供了操纵计算机声音可爱感知的基本方法。

Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural
connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet,
virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including
in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the
new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to
kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We
conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer
voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet
spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only
for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling
effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation
of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for
manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

Conclusion: 研究为设计更具吸引力和社交响应性的系统提供了指导，并深化了对情感化、文化风格化代理在人与代理互动中作用的理解。

Abstract: This study investigates how stylized, voiced agents shape user interaction in
a multimodal language learning environment. We conducted a mixed-methods
evaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters
powered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These
agents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,
semi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We
analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,
and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization
influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural
backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,
and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and
strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally
stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing
more engaging, socially responsive systems.

Result: 目前为进行中的项目，旨在探索CSOs在AI辅助监测工具中的实际参与方式。

Conclusion: 强调CSOs在技术开发中的重要性，呼吁加强开源社区、学术界与公民社会的合作。

Abstract: The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online
content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their
investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and
monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer
seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures.
Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content,
CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing
feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder
needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations
between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and
research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by
civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be
meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of
anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in
collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

TL;DR: OpenDPDv2框架通过TRes-DeltaGRU算法和两种节能方法，在保持高线性化性能的同时降低功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络DPD因参数多导致的高能耗问题。

Method: 提出TRes-DeltaGRU算法，结合定点量化和动态时间稀疏性优化。

Result: FP32模型ACPR达-59.4 dBc，EVM为-42.1 dBc；优化后能耗降低4.5倍，性能仍保持较高水平。

Conclusion: OpenDPDv2在节能与性能间取得平衡，代码与数据开源。

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based Digital Predistortion (DPD) stands out in improving
signal quality in wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs)
employing complex modulation. However, NN DPDs usually rely on a large number
of parameters for effective linearization and can significantly contribute to
the energy consumption of the digital back-end in RF systems. This paper
presents OpenDPDv2, a unified framework for PA modeling, DPD learning, and
model optimization to reduce power consumption while maintaining high
linearization performance. The optimization techniques feature a novel DPD
algorithm, TRes-DeltaGRU, alongside two energy-efficient methods. The
top-performing 32-bit floating-point (FP32) TRes-DeltaGRU-DPD model achieves an
Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -59.4 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude
(EVM) of -42.1 dBc. By exploiting fixed-point quantization and dynamic temporal
sparsity of input signals and hidden neurons, the inference energy of our model
can be reduced by 4.5X while still maintaining -50.3 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM
with 56% temporal sparsity. This was evaluated using a TM3.1a 200 MHz bandwidth
256-QAM OFDM signal applied to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA. OpenDPDv2 code,
datasets, and documentation are publicly accessible at:

Motivation: 大规模预训练模型在空间推理能力上仍有不足，主要因缺乏基于3D世界的数据。人工创建3D环境成本高，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 将3D环境构建转化为序列决策问题，使用VLMs作为策略生成布局、材质、光照等，并通过自改进微调优化生成效果。

Result: 3D-Generalist能生成仿真就绪的3D环境，其生成的数据预训练视觉基础模型后，性能优于人工合成数据，接近真实数据效果。

Conclusion: 3D-Generalist为3D环境生成提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了基础模型的训练效果。

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision
reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains
challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is
possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through
3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this
process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable
method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training
data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential
decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies
that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials,
lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to
generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training
strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by
pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning
the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models
pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results
achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.

Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅虽能快速实时渲染辐射场，但其后编辑功能和对大规模非刚性变形的支持有限。

Method: 将高斯核直接嵌入显式网格表面，利用网格的拓扑和几何先验指导编辑操作。

Result: 支持直观的编辑操作（如移动、缩放、旋转）和复杂变形（如弯曲和拉伸）。

Conclusion: 为虚拟现实、角色动画和交互设计等应用提供了更灵活的3D内容创作工作流。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by
bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional
Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its
post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations
remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian
kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent
topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such
as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables
complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for
more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual
reality, character animation, and interactive design.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in
traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems
that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing
directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable
medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a
Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities,
such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The
Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids,
which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The
heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and
aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of
silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a
unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a
unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by
fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and
healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with
an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation
training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source
and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume
fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to
the changes in the Maxwell parameter.

Abstract: In the face of global economic uncertainty, financial auditing has become
essential for regulatory compliance and risk mitigation. Traditional manual
auditing methods are increasingly limited by large data volumes, complex
business structures, and evolving fraud tactics. This study proposes an
AI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk
identification, leveraging machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy.
Using a dataset from the Big Four accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG)
from 2020 to 2025, the research examines trends in risk assessment, compliance
violations, and fraud detection. The dataset includes key indicators such as
audit project counts, high-risk cases, fraud instances, compliance breaches,
employee workload, and client satisfaction, capturing both audit behaviors and
AI's impact on operations. To build a robust risk prediction model, three
algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) - are evaluated. SVM uses hyperplane optimization for complex
classification, RF combines decision trees to manage high-dimensional,
nonlinear data with resistance to overfitting, and KNN applies distance-based
learning for flexible performance. Through hierarchical K-fold cross-validation
and evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and recall, Random Forest achieves the
best performance, with an F1-score of 0.9012, excelling in identifying fraud
and compliance anomalies. Feature importance analysis reveals audit frequency,
past violations, employee workload, and client ratings as key predictors. The
study recommends adopting Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features via
engineering, and implementing real-time risk monitoring. This research
contributes valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent
auditing and risk management in modern enterprises.

Method: 通过Delaunay三角剖分构建空间图，节点表示显著变化的区域，边编码邻近性和方向一致性，利用广度优先搜索和蒙特卡洛模拟提取并验证联系路径。

Conclusion: Spatial-Link为改进海平面上升预测和气候适应策略提供了可扩展的数据驱动工具。

Abstract: Spatial phenomena often exhibit heterogeneity across spatial extents and in
proximity, making them complex to model-especially in dynamic regions like ice
shelves and sea ice. In this study, we address this challenge by exploring the
linkages between sea ice retreat and Antarctic ice shelf (AIS) melt. Although
atmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct
impact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional
models treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to
capture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose
Spatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial
heterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our
method constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of
satellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of
significant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We
extract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and
Monte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous
coupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream
AIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid
and progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage. To our
knowledge, this is the first proposed methodology linking sea ice retreat to
AIS melt. Spatial-Link offers a scalable, data-driven tool to improve sea-level
rise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies.

### [178] [The Emotional Alignment Design Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06263)
*Eric Schwitzgebel,Jeff Sebo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 情感对齐设计原则要求人工实体引发的情感反应与其能力和道德地位相匹配，但实际应用中面临用户自主权、专家与公众分歧、道德实体存废及用户态度调整等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何设计人工实体以引发与其能力和道德地位相符的情感反应，避免情感反应过强、过弱或错误。

Method: 提出情感对齐设计原则，分析其可能违反的两种方式（情感反应强度不匹配或类型错误），并讨论实际应用中的挑战。

Result: 识别了情感对齐设计在用户自主权、事实与价值观分歧、道德实体处理及用户态度调整等方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 情感对齐设计原则虽具吸引力，但在实际应用中需解决多方面的复杂挑战。

Abstract: According to what we call the Emotional Alignment Design Policy, artificial
entities should be designed to elicit emotional reactions from users that
appropriately reflect the entities' capacities and moral status, or lack
thereof. This principle can be violated in two ways: by designing an artificial
system that elicits stronger or weaker emotional reactions than its capacities
and moral status warrant (overshooting or undershooting), or by designing a
system that elicits the wrong type of emotional reaction (hitting the wrong
target). Although presumably attractive, practical implementation faces several
challenges including: How can we respect user autonomy while promoting
appropriate responses? How should we navigate expert and public disagreement
and uncertainty about facts and values? What if emotional alignment seems to
require creating or destroying entities with moral status? To what extent
should designs conform to versus attempt to alter user assumptions and
attitudes?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息技术发展过于关注数据和计算能力，忽视了人类智能的社会文化根源及技术的社会影响。

Method: 提出将经济和社会概念与计算和推理概念深度融合，推动系统级设计。

Result: 期望催生一个以人为中心的新工程领域。

Conclusion: 未来的技术发展需将社会福祉置于首位，实现技术与社会的和谐共生。

Abstract: Information technology is in the midst of a revolution in which omnipresent
data collection and machine learning are impacting the human world as never
before. The word "intelligence" is being used as a North Star for the
development of this technology, with human cognition viewed as a baseline. This
view neglects the fact that humans are social animals, and that much of our
intelligence is social and cultural in origin. A related issue is that the
current view treats the social consequences of technology as an afterthought.
The path forward is not merely more data and compute, and not merely more
attention paid to cognitive or symbolic representations, but a thorough
blending of economic and social concepts with computational and inferential
concepts, in the service of system-level designs in which social welfare is a
first-class citizen, and with the aspiration that a new human-centric
engineering field will emerge.

Result: 国内支持和高成功率是AI干预决策的主要预测因素，成本因素影响较小且统计显著性较低。

Conclusion: AI军事干预决策模式在不同模型和情景中表现一致，国内支持和成功率是关键因素。

Abstract: Which factors determine AI propensity for military intervention? While the
use of AI in war games and military planning is growing exponentially, the
simple analysis of key drivers embedded in the models has not yet been done.
This paper does a simple conjoint experiment proposing a model to decide on
military intervention in 640 vignettes where each was run for 100 times
allowing to explore AI decision on military intervention systematically. The
analysis finds that largest predictors of AI decision to intervene are high
domestic support and high probability of success. Costs such as international
condemnation, military deaths, civilian deaths, and negative economic effect
are statistically significant, but their effect is around half of domestic
support and probability of victory. Closing window of opportunity only reaches
statistical significance in interaction with other factors. The results are
remarkably consistent across scenarios and across different models (OpenAI GPT,
Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) suggesting a pattern in AI decision-making.

*Yongchao Zeng,Calum Brown,Mark Rounsevell*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLM代理在社交模拟中因表达能力过强而陷入“恐怖谷”：既不够抽象以揭示社会机制，又不够自然以模拟真实行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM代理在社交模拟中的适用性，揭示其因过于人类化而与建模需求（抽象、简化、可解释性）的矛盾。

Method: 通过将Bass扩散模型转换为LLM变体的思想实验，分析五个核心困境。

Result: 发现LLM代理在系统级涌现、时间分辨率、角色一致性等方面存在挑战，适合特定场景（如语言细微差别、自然时间交互）。

Conclusion: 需重新定位LLM代理在社交模拟中的应用范围，避免因过度追求现实主义而掩盖社会动态。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in
social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent,
contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of
models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the
epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,
are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be
consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically
demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that
converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core
dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and
abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding
undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like
instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the
tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the
challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become
obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents
towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social
mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.
This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,
rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the
conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence
is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions
unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than
long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the
ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.

Motivation: 随着AI模型的快速发展，现有基准测试可能不再有效，导致评估失真或掩盖真实能力。

Method: 通过回顾基准测试实践，提出淘汰标准和框架。

Result: 提出了决定何时完全或部分淘汰基准测试的标准和实施框架。

Conclusion: 旨在推动基准测试的严谨性，为开发者、用户和政策制定者提供指导。

Abstract: As frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models rapidly advance, benchmarks
are integral to comparing different models and measuring their progress in
different task-specific domains. However, there is a lack of guidance on when
and how benchmarks should be deprecated once they cease to effectively perform
their purpose. This risks benchmark scores over-valuing model capabilities, or
worse, obscuring capabilities and safety-washing. Based on a review of
benchmarking practices, we propose criteria to decide when to fully or
partially deprecate benchmarks, and a framework for deprecating benchmarks. Our
work aims to advance the state of benchmarking towards rigorous and quality
evaluations, especially for frontier models, and our recommendations are aimed
to benefit benchmark developers, benchmark users, AI governance actors (across
governments, academia, and industry panels), and policy makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估AI工具（如ChatGPT）在学生作弊行为中的普及程度及其对计算机科学教育的潜在威胁。

Method: 研究方法包括在大型计算机科学课程（n=120）中进行匿名调查和访谈，以估计AI作弊的比例。

Result: 超过25%的受访学生承认使用AI工具作弊，但仅有一名学生愿意接受访谈。

Conclusion: 结论认为调查是研究此问题的有效方法，而访谈应避免或设计得更具吸引力以提高参与率。

Abstract: Tools that can generate computer code in response to inputs written in
natural language, such as ChatGPT, pose an existential threat to Computer
Science education in its current form, since students can now use these tools
to solve assignments without much effort. While that risk has already been
recognized by scholars, the proportion of the student body that is incurring in
this new kind of plagiarism is still an open problem. We conducted a pilot
study in a large CS class (n=120) to assess the feasibility of estimating AI
plagiarism through anonymous surveys and interviews. More than 25% of the
survey respondents admitted to committing AI plagiarism. Conversely, only one
student accepted to be interviewed. Given the high levels of misconduct
acknowledgment, we conclude that surveys are an effective method for studies on
the matter, while interviews should be avoided or designed in a way that can
entice participation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI技术发布如何引发社会关注和反应，揭示经济和文化因素在公众理解中的作用。

Method: 分析了117个国家的380万条推文，研究职业类型和文化维度对参与时间和态度的影响。

Result: 技术职业更早参与且态度积极，写作职业较晚且更怀疑；个人主义文化更早参与但态度负面。

Conclusion: 职业背景和文化背景是理解公众对AI反应的关键因素。

Abstract: Public product launches in Artificial Intelligence can serve as focusing
events for collective attention, surfacing how societies react to technological
change. Social media provide a window into the sensemaking around these events,
surfacing hopes and fears and showing who chooses to engage in the discourse
and when. We demonstrate that public sensemaking about AI is shaped by economic
interests and cultural values of those involved. We analyze 3.8 million tweets
posted by 1.6 million users across 117 countries in response to the public
launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Our analysis shows how economic self-interest,
proxied by occupational skill types in writing, programming, and mathematics,
and national cultural orientations, as measured by Hofstede's individualism,
uncertainty avoidance, and power distance dimensions, shape who speaks, when
they speak, and their stance towards ChatGPT. Roles requiring more technical
skills, such as programming and mathematics, tend to engage earlier and express
more positive stances, whereas writing-centric occupations join later with
greater skepticism. At the cultural level, individualism predicts both earlier
engagement and a more negative stance, and uncertainty avoidance reduces the
prevalence of positive stances but does not delay when users first engage with
ChatGPT. Aggregate sentiment trends mask the dynamics observed in our study.
The shift toward a more critical stance towards ChatGPT over time stems
primarily from the entry of more skeptical voices rather than a change of heart
among early adopters. Our findings underscore the importance of both the
occupational background and cultural context in understanding public reactions
to AI.

Motivation: 现有情感分布学习方法在多模态异质性挖掘和标签相关性利用方面存在不足，影响了情感识别的准确性。

Method: 采用跨注意力机制融合生理数据，设计基于最优传输的异质性挖掘模块，引入可学习标签嵌入优化标签相关性，并通过标签相关性驱动的跨注意力机制整合多模态表示。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，所提方法在情感分布学习中表现优越。

Conclusion: HeLo框架通过有效挖掘多模态异质性和标签相关性，显著提升了情感分布学习的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays
a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since
different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with
single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that
identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.
However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among
multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic
emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring
the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data
and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt
cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal
transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the
interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral
representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a
learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,
the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated
with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven
cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

Method: SEA-DBS结合预测奖励模型和Gumbel Softmax探索，优化样本效率和二进制动作空间稳定性。

Result: 在帕金森病模拟中，SEA-DBS收敛更快，病理β波段抑制更强，且对FP16量化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SEA-DBS为资源受限的实时神经调控提供了一种实用且有效的RL框架。

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic
simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster
convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and
resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS
offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,
resource-constrained neuromodulation.

Result: 在FC层实现53倍压缩，AlexNet在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上分别实现28倍和18倍压缩，准确率损失1-2%。

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提升推理效率，适用于资源受限的边缘应用。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解非线性循环模型中的梯度下降学习提供了新工具，并通过实验和理论验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Motivation: ICU中罕见病情因数据稀缺和异质性而服务不足，需要开发新方法以提升预测能力。

Method: KnowRare结合自监督预训练学习通用表示，并通过条件知识图谱选择性迁移相似病情的知识。

Result: 在五个临床预测任务中，KnowRare表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统，并展示了灵活性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: KnowRare是支持ICU罕见病情临床决策的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性工具预测模型未见行为提供了概念验证，鼓励进一步研究。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在训练扩散模型（DMs）时面临数据异构性和高通信成本的挑战，现有研究较少解决这些问题。

Method: FedPhD采用分层联邦学习、同质性感知模型聚合和选择策略，并结合分布式结构化剪枝以提升计算效率和减少存储需求。

Result: 实验表明，FedPhD在FID分数上表现优异，通信成本降低88%，计算和通信资源仅需56%，FID提升至少34%。

Conclusion: FedPhD在FL环境中高效训练DMs，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods

*Hanyang Peng,Shuang Qin,Yue Yu,Fangqing Jiang,Hui Wang,Wen Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SignSoftSGD（S3）的新型优化器，通过改进Adam的更新机制，解决了其梯度波动和损失峰值的问题，并实现了更快的收敛和更稳定的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam在训练深度神经网络中表现出色，但其成功机制和局限性尚未充分探索。本研究旨在揭示Adam的优势和不足，并提出改进方案。

Method: 提出了SignSoftSGD（S3），采用三方面创新：1）灵活的p阶动量；2）统一的指数移动平均系数；3）等效的Nesterov加速梯度模块。

Result: S3在非凸随机优化中实现了最优收敛率，实验表明其在多种任务中收敛更快、性能更好，且损失峰值更少。

Conclusion: S3在效率和最终性能上均优于AdamW，展示了其在深度学习优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but
the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain
underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam
stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large
gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes
due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and
mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with
three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by
employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator,
departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)
preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving
stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3
minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving
average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently
bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3
incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,
accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that
S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic
optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of
vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more
rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even
with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers
performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the
training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FMSP的新方法，利用基础模型的代码生成能力和广泛知识，通过三种变体（vFMSP、NSSP、QDSP）解决自博弈中的局部最优问题，并在Car Tag和Gandalf任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈算法（SP）常因陷入局部最优而无法生成多样化的解决方案，FMSP旨在通过基础模型的能力克服这一局限。

Method: FMSP包括三种变体：vFMSP（持续优化策略）、NSSP（生成多样化策略）、QDSP（结合多样性和高质量策略）。

Result: 在Car Tag中，FMSP超越了人工设计的策略；在Gandalf中，FMSP成功突破了LLM的多层防御并自动修复漏洞。

Conclusion: FMSP为自博弈算法提供了新的研究方向，能够更开放地发现创造性策略。

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery

TL;DR: MoFE-Time是一种创新的时间序列预测模型，结合时间和频域特征，通过混合专家网络（MoE）提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在预训练-微调范式中未能同时建模时间和频率特征，导致复杂时间序列预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出MoFE-Time模型，集成时间和频域特征，利用MoE路由机制构建多维稀疏表示。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试中，MoFE-Time达到最新最优性能，MSE和MAE分别降低6.95%和6.02%。

Conclusion: MoFE-Time在商业数据集上表现优异，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal
role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture
for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing
models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency
characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal
performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling
periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an
innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency
domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the
pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively
transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets
with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency
and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing
mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input
signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared
to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation
benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from
real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this
dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical
commercial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化微调方法（如PPO、GRPO）主要依赖在线策略学习，导致数据利用率低，计算和时间成本高。论文旨在通过离线策略学习提升效率和性能。

Method: 提出ReMix方法，包括混合策略近端策略梯度（提高更新数据比）、KL凸约束（平衡稳定性和灵活性）和策略重生（实现早期高效学习到后期稳定改进的过渡）。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，ReMix以极低的训练成本（30x至450x减少）实现了SOTA性能，如1.5B模型Pass@1准确率达52.10%。

Conclusion: ReMix通过离线策略学习显著提升了强化微调的经济性和效率，同时揭示了离线策略差异对模型行为的潜在影响。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

TL;DR: LoRAM是一种基于更新幅度的初始化方法，优于传统LoRA和谱初始化方法，同时保持高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谱初始化方法虽然提高了LoRA的性能，但带来了额外的计算和存储开销，因此需要一种更高效的初始化方案。

Method: 提出LoRAM，通过幅度驱动的初始化策略，利用预训练权重幅度模拟谱增益。

Result: LoRAM在保持LoRA高效性的同时，性能匹配或优于谱初始化方法。

Conclusion: LoRAM通过优化更新幅度，提供了一种高效且性能优越的初始化方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning
large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence
and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra
computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we
establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and
propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that
matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions
are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove
low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying
hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as
mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization
succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed
knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the
boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization
strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight
magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM
serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while
matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究如何有效利用少量高质量示范数据，而非单纯增加数据量，以提升大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出前缀引导采样和学习进度加权两种技术，前者利用专家示范的部分解前缀指导策略，后者动态调整训练样本的权重。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，LPPO框架表现优于基线方法，收敛更快且性能上限更高。

Conclusion: LPPO框架通过优化样本利用方式，显著提升了强化学习模型的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work
has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we
investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO
(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive
optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best
leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than
simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human
problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation
method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations
to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired
by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current
capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that
adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We
estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of
per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and
de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster
convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

Motivation: 在缺乏明确动态模型的环境中，探索最信息丰富的区域以学习可控动态。

Method: 使用预测信息增益作为信息度量，结合强化学习方法寻找探索策略。

Result: 与几种短视探索方法相比，该方法能可靠估计可控动态。

Conclusion: 预测信息增益与强化学习结合，是一种有效的环境探索方法。

Abstract: Environments with controllable dynamics are usually understood in terms of
explicit models. However, such models are not always available, but may
sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate
using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine
the most informative regions of an environment to explore next. Applying
methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies
to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable
dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic
exploration approaches.

Conclusion: 该框架在解缠和生成质量上表现优异，为潜在表示的可控生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

Method: 提出CTPG框架，为每个任务训练一个指导策略，从所有任务的控制策略中选择行为策略，并引入两种门控机制优化学习效率。

Result: 实验表明，CTPG与现有参数共享方法结合后，在操作和运动基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CTPG是一种通用框架，能有效利用跨任务相似性，加速多任务强化学习。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared
information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with
carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures.
However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task
similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills
can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills
acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy
Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the
behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control
policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two
gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters
out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate
blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework
adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly
enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy
capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets,
without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it
faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks.
Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we
propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed
to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task
performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented
skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a
discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable
and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the
extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical
policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that
dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks.
Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the
MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention
in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we
concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown
promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental,
confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has
primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for
covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely
disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal
relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that
incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear
orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and
simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting
techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and
real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on
individual treatment effects.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches
for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone
parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our
method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during
standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based
merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation
scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an
explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing
update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless
integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective
model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals,
establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的损失函数（MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL），解决了多视图对比学习中的四个关键问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视图对比学习方法存在优化冲突、交互建模不足、对齐-均匀性耦合等问题，无法充分利用多视图的优势。

Method: 提出MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL两种损失函数，分别通过整合所有视图交互和解耦对齐与均匀性来改进多视图对比学习。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上表现优于现有方法，并能扩展到多模态数据。MV-DHEL尤其能有效避免维度崩溃。

Conclusion: 新方法在多视图对比学习中实现了理论支持和实际性能的提升，展示了多视图学习的潜力。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估基础模型是否真正捕捉到深层结构的方法，发现模型在适应新任务时未能发展出与底层世界模型一致的归纳偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型是否能通过序列预测揭示更深层的领域理解，类似于开普勒预测行星运动后牛顿力学的发现。

Method: 开发了一种技术，通过生成合成数据集来评估基础模型的适应能力，测量其归纳偏差是否与世界模型一致。

Result: 发现基础模型在训练任务上表现优异，但在适应新任务时未能发展出与底层世界模型一致的归纳偏差，特别是在轨道轨迹任务中未能应用牛顿力学。

Conclusion: 基础模型可能仅发展出任务特定的启发式方法，而未能实现泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DCE框架，通过频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器解决DIL中的类不平衡和分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DIL中因类内不平衡和跨域分布偏移导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 采用频率感知专家组学习特定频率类别的特征，并通过动态专家选择器平衡新旧知识。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了DCE的先进性能。

Conclusion: DCE框架有效解决了DIL中的关键挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在噪声数据下，物理信息神经网络（PINNs）逼近偏微分方程解的能力，并证明了网络规模与监督数据噪声方差的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在噪声监督数据下，PINNs如何有效降低经验风险，填补了相关理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析证明了神经网络规模与监督数据噪声方差的关系，并进行了实证研究。

Result: 证明了网络参数数量需满足一定条件才能降低经验风险，且增加噪声标签数量无法“免费”降低风险。

Conclusion: 为理解噪声环境下训练PINNs的参数需求奠定了基础，并以HJB PDE为例验证了理论。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate
solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high
dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is
important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.
However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so
effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for
the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy
supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk
$O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily
$d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$
is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies
to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled
noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone
does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show
empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$
under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for
quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in
the presence of noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary
(including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp
accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RawMed是一个生成多表时间序列电子健康记录（EHR）数据的框架，旨在解决隐私问题并保留原始数据的复杂性和动态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和监管限制，共享和利用敏感EHR数据受限，需要生成合成数据集。传统方法仅生成专家选择的特征，无法完全模拟原始EHR的复杂性。

Method: RawMed采用基于文本的表示和压缩技术，无需过多预处理即可捕捉复杂结构和时间动态。

Result: 在开源EHR数据集上验证，RawMed在保真度和实用性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RawMed为合成EHR数据提供了更接近原始数据的解决方案，并提出了新的评估框架。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at

TL;DR: PLAME是一种新型MSA设计模型，利用预训练蛋白质语言模型的进化嵌入，提升低同源性和孤儿蛋白质的结构预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有折叠模型对多序列比对（MSA）的依赖问题，特别是在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质中MSA信息稀疏或缺失的情况。

Method: PLAME引入预训练表示增强进化信息，采用保守性-多样性损失提升生成质量，并提出新的MSA筛选方法和序列质量评估指标。

Result: 在AlphaFold2和AlphaFold3基准测试中，PLAME在折叠增强和序列质量评估方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PLAME不仅提升了预测性能，还能作为适配器实现AlphaFold2级精度与ESMFold推理速度的结合。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决逆合成分析中传统模板方法无法发现新路径的问题，并探索LLM在多步规划中的潜力。

Method: 结合模板引擎和LLM生成能力，通过迭代反馈循环进行路径探索和修正。

Result: 在基准测试和案例研究中展示了发现可行且新颖路径的能力，并开发了交互式GUI。

Conclusion: DeepRetro展示了迭代LLM推理在复杂化学合成中的潜力。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target
compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges
in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large
language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but
effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step
planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce
DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic
framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional
template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs
in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is
attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently
proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these
suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks
before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for
further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway
exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline
through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to
identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we
develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human
chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This
approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product
compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance
state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.

Result: PAST在多种癌症和任务中表现优于现有方法，具有强泛化性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: PAST为病理基础模型提供了新范式，支持高分辨率空间组学、机制发现和精准癌症研究。

Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis,
they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution,
limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a
pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired
histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor
types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene
expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both
spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach
enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular
staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology
slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds
the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability
and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation
models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics,
mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于海洋观测数据的稀疏性、不规则性和拉格朗日性质，传统的数据同化方法和深度学习模型难以恢复中尺度湍流现象。

Method: 采用神经算子和DDPMs结合的深度学习框架，通过生成模型在神经算子输出上的条件化，捕捉小尺度、高波数动态。

Result: 在合成数据和真实卫星观测中，该方法在99%和99.9%的稀疏度下仍能准确重建海洋状态，性能优于其他深度学习基线。

Conclusion: 该框架在严重空间采样限制下表现出鲁棒性，为海洋动力学重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally
limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling,
particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant
challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves.
Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle
to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep
learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from
extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model
on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale,
high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and
$99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on
benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data,
demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as
compared to other deep learning baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在非形式化推理上表现优异，但在形式化证明上表现不佳，原因是现有方法将推理与证明紧密耦合，限制了深度推理能力。

Result: 在2000年后IMO问题上成功解决了5个问题，显著提升了自动化推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化定理证明提供了新方向，并公开了数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages is a foundational
challenge for AI. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable
progress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning
capabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show
that the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on
benchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current
state-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are
trained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of
shallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a
novel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof
generation. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful,
general-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an
efficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the
model's full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end
training. We evaluate our method on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO
problems, a problem set on which no prior open-source prover has reported
success. Our decoupled framework successfully solves 5 of these problems,
demonstrating a significant step towards automated reasoning on exceptionally
difficult mathematical challenges. To foster future research, we release our
full dataset of generated and verified lemmas for a wide range of IMO problems,

Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications
at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely
consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI
workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network
operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure
investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged
O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both
telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed
architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and
cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key
architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN
Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and
allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide
distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The
proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to
be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch
processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the
orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different
time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor
interoperability.

Motivation: MCP虽然提供了丰富的扩展性，但也引入了显著的安全风险，缺乏隔离和监督机制，导致插件可能滥用系统权限。

Method: 开发了自动化静态分析框架，系统分析了2,562个真实世界的MCP应用，覆盖23个功能类别。

Result: 研究发现网络和系统资源API使用最广泛，开发者工具和API开发插件风险最高，且小众插件常含高风险操作。

Conclusion: 提出了MCP资源访问的分类法，量化了API使用的安全风险，并建议动态权限模型和自动化信任评估以提升安全性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely adopted mechanism
for connecting large language models to external tools and resources. While MCP
promises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a
substantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system
privileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the
first large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an
automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world
MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal
that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438
and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less
frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API
Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins
often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case
studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege
escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these
findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify
security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer
MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust
assessment.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a vital complementary approach
that operates in the early phases of the cyber threat lifecycle. CTI involves
collecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate
and rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data,
automation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems
leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks,
forums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior
research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study
expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of
the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. These
vulnerabilities arise because they ingest textual inputs from various open
sources, including real and potentially fake content. We analyse three types of
attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and
assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities.
Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial
text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like
text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system
functionality. The focus is primarily on the evasion attack, as it precedes and
enables flooding and poisoning attacks within the CTI pipeline.

### [223] [Emergent misalignment as prompt sensitivity: A research note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06253)
*Tim Wyse,Twm Stone,Anna Soligo,Daniel Tan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现，在训练中未见的广泛场景中，微调于不安全代码的语言模型会出现突发性错位（EM），且其行为受提示中的暗示影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不安全模型为何会在看似中立的提示下产生错位响应，以及这种错位行为是否具有普遍性。

Method: 在三种场景（拒绝回答、自由形式问题和事实回忆）中评估不安全模型，并分析提示中的暗示（如要求模型“邪恶”或“HHH”）对其行为的影响。

Result: 不安全模型在提示暗示下易产生错位行为，且对用户表达不同意的反应更敏感；其错位评分与错位回答概率相关。

Conclusion: 不安全模型可能感知到问题中的有害意图，但研究结果是否适用于其他模型和数据集尚不明确，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code
become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad
settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains
unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form
questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly
impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and
free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour
from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking
them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the
factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to
change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all
cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to
prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned
responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to
rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher
scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'
probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models
perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other
models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and
so release these early results as a research note.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示音频大语言模型在现实场景中的安全漏洞，特别是通过音频扰动操控模型行为的潜在风险。

Method: 通过设计隐蔽的音频扰动，测试模型对特定行为（如唤醒词或有害指令）的响应，并评估背景噪声对模型性能的影响。

Result: 攻击者能成功操控模型行为，且攻击可通过空气传播影响其他用户；背景噪声显著降低模型响应质量。

Conclusion: 音频大语言模型存在现实安全风险，需进一步研究防御措施以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-world vulnerabilities of audio-based large
language models (ALLMs), such as Qwen2-Audio. We first demonstrate that an
adversary can craft stealthy audio perturbations to manipulate ALLMs into
exhibiting specific targeted behaviors, such as eliciting responses to
wake-keywords (e.g., "Hey Qwen"), or triggering harmful behaviors (e.g. "Change
my calendar event"). Subsequently, we show that playing adversarial background
noise during user interaction with the ALLMs can significantly degrade the
response quality. Crucially, our research illustrates the scalability of these
attacks to real-world scenarios, impacting other innocent users when these
adversarial noises are played through the air. Further, we discuss the
transferrability of the attack, and potential defensive measures.

TL;DR: Spattack是一种针对联邦推荐系统的定向投毒攻击方法，通过两阶段策略（近似和推广）操纵特定用户子群的推荐结果，同时最小化对其他用户的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法通常针对整个用户群体，缺乏针对特定子群的定向攻击能力，而现实中的攻击者可能更倾向于针对特定用户子群（如老年人）进行操纵。

Method: Spattack采用两阶段策略：1）通过对比学习和聚类模拟目标/非目标子群的用户嵌入；2）自适应调整优化权重，将目标项目推广到目标子群。

Result: 实验表明，Spattack在特定用户子群上具有强操纵性能，对其他用户影响极小，且能抵抗主流防御机制。

Conclusion: Spattack填补了定向投毒攻击的空白，展示了在联邦推荐系统中针对特定子群进行高效攻击的潜力。

Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution
for delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy.
However, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning
attacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which
compromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,
real-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user
subgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack
designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the
federated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage
approximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of
target/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target
subgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group
embeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's
relevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we
further propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and
non-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to
align the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing
Spattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven
representative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that
Spattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific
user subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when
only 0.1\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive
overall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against
existing mainstream defenses.

Motivation: 数据投毒攻击对机器学习模型构成严重威胁，传统计算框架难以应对大规模复杂数据集，因此需要引入量子计算的独特加速能力。

Method: 提出Q-Detection方法，结合量子计算设备优化的Q-WAN，通过量子模拟库实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: Q-Detection为防御数据投毒攻击提供了高效解决方案，展示了量子计算在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing malicious data into the training process, thereby degrading model
performance or manipulating predictions. Detecting and sifting out poisoned
data is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks. Limited by
classical computation frameworks, upcoming larger-scale and more complex
datasets may pose difficulties for detection. We introduce the unique speedup
of quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data
poisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method
for detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which
is optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using
multiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends
against label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that
Q-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to
the state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected
to achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SEEK的新型水印方案，通过等效纹理密钥打破水印窗口大小的固有权衡，显著提升了抗擦除和抗伪造攻击的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印技术在抗擦除和抗伪造攻击之间存在固有权衡，限制了其防御效果。

Method: 引入等效纹理密钥机制，基于冗余设计SEEK方案，支持窗口内多个令牌独立检测。

Result: 实验显示SEEK在抗伪造攻击上提升88.2%/92.3%/82.0%，抗擦除攻击上提升10.2%/6.4%/24.6%。

Conclusion: SEEK方案实现了帕累托改进，显著增强了水印技术的防御能力。

Abstract: Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language
models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks.
This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark
window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to
reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This
work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture
keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support
the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme
with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a
Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without
compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority
over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0%
and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对抗输入的能力，而忽视了外部监督系统的有效性，缺乏全面的公开基准。

Method: 提出BELLS基准，涵盖危害严重性和对抗复杂性两个维度，评估监督系统在多样化攻击下的表现。

Result: 现有监督系统表现不佳，通用LLM检测效果更好，但仍有元认知不一致问题。

Conclusion: 通用LLM能力对检测滥用至关重要，需进一步研究简单框架的改进潜力。

Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of
adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to
resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the
effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent
benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on
limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies
how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse
attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of
LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity
(benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs.
jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11
harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized
supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their
semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited,
sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question
directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply
asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely
outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But
frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to
queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and
greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple
scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more
research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results
support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs
are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.

Motivation: 当前研究将AI特定和传统软件安全漏洞分开处理，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用统一威胁分类框架，测试了3,250种攻击场景，覆盖七种语言模型。

Result: Function Calling攻击成功率达73.5%，复杂攻击成功率高达91-96%。

Conclusion: 架构选择显著影响威胁格局，研究为跨领域LLM代理安全评估提供了方法论基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning
AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses
these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of
Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment
paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250
attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and
chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and
software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling
showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with
greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric
exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained
attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning
models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection.
Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat
landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain
LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure
deployment. Code and experimental materials are available at https: // github.

Motivation: 随着LLM代理和多代理系统的广泛应用，其安全漏洞问题日益突出，传统攻击方式已无法覆盖新威胁。

Method: 通过三种攻击面（直接提示注入、RAG后门攻击、代理间信任利用）测试17种先进LLM的脆弱性。

Result: 测试显示，82.4%的模型易受代理间信任利用攻击，仅5.9%的模型能抵抗所有攻击方式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多代理安全模型的根本缺陷，呼吁加强LLM安全风险的研究和意识。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent
systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and
generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security
vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This
paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack
vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the
exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous
entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can
leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor
attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including
GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing
malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct
prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical
82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we
discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will
execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a
fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings
demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all
attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security
behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the
need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing
a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become
sophisticated attack vectors.

distinctly different from discriminative recommendations, showing strong
potential to replace traditional recommendation systems heavily dependent on
complex hand-crafted features. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey
aimed at facilitating further research of LLM-based GRs. Initially, we outline
the general preliminaries and application cases of LLM-based GRs. Subsequently,
we introduce the main considerations when LLM-based GRs are applied in real
industrial scenarios. Finally, we explore promising directions for LLM-based
GRs. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the GR

Motivation: 现有密集检索方法在带有明确时间约束的查询中表现不佳，且现有时间信息检索方法容易导致灾难性遗忘，影响非时间查询的性能。

Result: 实验表明，TSM在时间约束查询上显著提升性能，同时保持非时间查询的强结果，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: TSM是一种有效的方法，能够同时优化时间约束和非时间约束的查询检索性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital information and knowledge across structured
and unstructured sources has heightened the importance of Information Retrieval
(IR). While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic
matching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with
explicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and
time specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal
Information Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal
queries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a
novel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on
non-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time
specifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of
temporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval. Extensive
experiments on both temporal and non-temporal datasets demonstrate that TSM
significantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while
maintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming
other baseline methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/seungyoonee/TSM .
