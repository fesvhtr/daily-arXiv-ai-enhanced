Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较分析用于拟合3D图像数据的镶嵌模型算法策略，评估优化方法（如线性/非线性规划、随机优化和梯度下降）在生成Voronoi、Laguerre和GBPDs时的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在材料科学中，精确拟合3D图像数据（如多晶体和泡沫）的镶嵌模型是一个不断发展的领域，需要评估不同优化方法的适用性。

Method: 使用线性/非线性规划、随机优化（交叉熵法）和梯度下降等方法生成Voronoi、Laguerre和GBPDs模型，并通过体积、表面积和拓扑差异评估拟合质量。

Result: 研究揭示了模型复杂度、优化方法复杂度和拟合质量之间的权衡，为根据数据特征和应用需求选择合适方法提供了指导。

Conclusion: 通过比较不同优化方法，为材料科学中的3D图像数据拟合提供了实用建议，强调了方法选择的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for
fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals
and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess
optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming,
stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent --
for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams
(GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is
evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify
differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight
trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization
routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for
selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application
needs.

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the
quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the
transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method
demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including
video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

### [5] [CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14312)
*Marc Lafon,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,Clément Rambour,Christian Desrosier,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTTA是一种基于梯度的测试时适应方法，针对视觉语言模型设计，通过软对比损失提升泛化能力，并在开放集设置中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有的测试时适应方法（如熵最小化）与模型的对比训练目标不一致，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出CLIPTTA方法，利用软对比损失与CLIP预训练目标对齐，并通过理论分析证明其批次感知设计能避免崩溃风险。进一步扩展至开放集设置，使用Outlier Contrastive Exposure (OCE)损失提升OOD检测。

Result: 在75个数据集上的实验表明，CLIPTTA在分布偏移下表现稳定，优于基于熵的目标，并与最先进的TTA方法竞争。

Conclusion: CLIPTTA通过对齐预训练目标的设计，显著提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的适应能力，尤其在开放集设置中表现突出。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.

### [6] [Light Future: Multimodal Action Frame Prediction via InstructPix2Pix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14809)
*Zesen Zhong,Duomin Zhang,Yijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的机器人动作预测方法，利用InstructPix2Pix模型进行多模态未来帧预测，显著降低计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来运动轨迹在机器人、自主系统等领域至关重要，但传统视频预测模型计算成本高且延迟大。

Method: 采用深度学习框架，基于InstructPix2Pix模型，结合视觉和文本输入进行未来帧预测。

Result: 在RoboTWin数据集上，SSIM和PSNR优于现有方法，且仅需单帧图像和文本输入。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、轻量，适用于机器人动作预测和运动轨迹分析，优先考虑精度而非视觉保真度。

Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains
such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.

### [7] [A Hidden Stumbling Block in Generalized Category Discovery: Distracted Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14315)
*Qiyu Xu,Zhanxuan Hu,Yu Duan,Ercheng Pei,Yonghang Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为注意力聚焦（AF）的机制，通过剪除非信息性标记来解决广义类别发现（GCD）中的注意力分散问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法在处理未标记数据时容易受到任务无关背景区域的干扰，导致特征提取不理想。

Method: AF由两个组件组成：标记重要性测量（TIME）和多尺度标记自适应剪枝（TAP），通过量化标记重要性并剪除非信息性标记来优化注意力。

Result: AF在SimGCD方法中实现了15.4%的性能提升，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AF是一种轻量级、即插即用的模块，能有效提升GCD方法的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in
https://github.com/Afleve/AFGCD.

### [8] [Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367)
*Weiming Ren,Raghav Goyal,Zhiming Hu,Tristan Ty Aumentado-Armstrong,Iqbal Mohomed,Alex Levinshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 生成超分辨率（GSR）在感知图像质量上表现优异，但存在细节不匹配的幻觉问题。本文提出一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的幻觉评分（HS），并利用深度特征距离优化GSR模型以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GSR中细节与低分辨率图像或真实图像不匹配的幻觉问题，提升实际应用效果。

Method: 利用MLLM构建提示评估幻觉元素并生成HS，结合深度特征距离优化GSR模型。

Result: HS与人类评估一致，且与某些深度特征距离强相关，优化后的模型减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: HS和深度特征距离为GSR模型优化提供了新方向，有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.

*Praneeth Namburi,Roger Pallarès-López,Jessica Rosendorf,Duarte Folgado,Brian W. Anthony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUSTrack是一个结合深度学习和光流的半自动化工具包，用于B超视频中的点跟踪，解决了噪声和运动模糊问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B超图像中的斑点噪声、低边缘对比度和平面外运动使得组织运动跟踪困难，影响临床应用和研究。

Method: 结合深度学习和光流技术，提供图形界面支持训练数据生成和模型迭代优化，并引入光流滤波技术减少噪声。

Result: DUSTrack在准确性上优于现有零样本点跟踪器，与专用方法相当，适用于心脏、肌肉等多场景。

Conclusion: DUSTrack是一个开源、通用的工具，为临床和生物力学研究提供了强大的组织运动量化框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is
available at https://github.com/praneethnamburi/DUSTrack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决场景中对象与动作关联的可解释性问题，提升场景理解的鲁棒性和可信度。

Method: CRAFT整合了ConceptNet的常识先验、语言模型和CLIP的视觉证据，通过基于能量的推理循环迭代优化预测。

Result: 实验表明，CRAFT在多对象、无标签设置下提高了准确性，同时增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: CRAFT为鲁棒且可信的场景理解提供了新方向，结合了符号与感知结构的优势。

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action
(e.g., "cut"). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet
and language models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based
reasoning loop to refine predictions iteratively. This process yields
transparent, goal-driven decisions to ground symbolic and perceptual
structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free settings demonstrate that
CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability, providing a step
toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.

### [11] [IRGPT: Understanding Real-world Infrared Image with Bi-cross-modal Curriculum on Large-scale Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14449)
*Zhe Cao,Jin Zhang,Ruiheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRGPT是首个针对真实红外图像的多模态大语言模型，基于大规模红外-文本数据集（IR-TD）构建，通过双向跨模态课程迁移学习策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖合成红外图像，无法捕捉真实红外模态特性，因此需要开发专门针对真实红外图像的模型。

Method: 提出IR-TD数据集（26万真实红外图像-文本对），并采用双向跨模态课程迁移学习策略，从可见光到红外域系统迁移知识。

Result: 在9项任务（如识别、定位）上达到最先进性能，优于更大规模模型。

Conclusion: IRGPT通过真实数据集和迁移学习策略，显著提升了红外图像的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

*Weikang Gu,Mingyue Han,Li Xue,Heng Dong,Changcai Yang,Riqing Chen,Lifang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gestalt原则的并行交互网络（GPI-Net），用于点云配准中的高质量对应关系识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部和全局特征融合中的冗余和复杂空间关系问题。

Method: 利用Gestalt原则设计正交几何一致性策略，结合Gestalt特征注意力块（GFA）和双路径多粒度并行交互聚合块（DMG）。

Result: 在多个挑战性任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原则有效提升了点云配准中对应关系的质量。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模式规划方法难以处理多样化驾驶场景，需要一种能适应复杂交通环境的框架。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，驾驶分数和成功率领先，单目视觉输入下仍达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: GEMINUS通过混合专家框架显著提升了自动驾驶的适应性和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The
code will be available at https://github.com/newbrains1/GEMINUS.

images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.

*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang,Pengjie Xu,Ruirui Zhang,Fanchen Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiCorNet提出了一种新的序列建模框架，结合空间特征提取和时间差分，通过轻量级1D卷积编码器和可学习的差分时间算子（DSD）实现端到端的训练，显著提升了动态和感知混淆环境中的视觉地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态和感知混淆环境中视觉地点识别（VPR）的挑战，现有方法多基于单帧嵌入，忽略了图像序列中的时间一致性。

Method: 提出OptiCorNet框架，结合1D卷积编码器和可学习的差分时间算子（DSD），通过LSTM细化和残差投影生成紧凑且鲁棒的描述符，并使用四元组损失增强类间可分性。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，OptiCorNet在季节和视角变化等挑战下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OptiCorNet通过端到端学习序列级嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的地点识别效果。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Tian Zhang,Jianquan Liu,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFQ-ViT提出了一种无需数据的ViT量化方法，通过合成高质量样本和激活校正矩阵，显著提升了量化模型的性能，且无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成样本时未能平衡全局和局部特征，且量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活分布差异大，导致性能下降。

Method: 按难度递增顺序合成样本，并引入激活校正矩阵以对齐量化与全精度模型的中间层激活。

Result: DFQ-ViT性能优于现有DFQ方法，接近真实数据量化模型，如3位量化的DeiT-T性能提升4.29%。

Conclusion: DFQ-ViT无需微调，降低计算开销和部署门槛，符合绿色学习原则，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在缺乏典型结构特征时补全点云的局限性，提升生成能力和泛化性。

Method: 设计了结构共享特征编码器（SSFE）和渐进检索增强生成器（PRAG），结合跨模态检索和层次特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集和真实场景中验证了方法的有效性，能够处理稀疏数据和未见类别。

Conclusion: 该方法通过检索增强和特征融合，显著提升了点云补全的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCP-LLaVA是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过令牌压缩技术解决病理学全切片图像（WSI）视觉问答（VQA）中的高计算资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学全切片图像（WSI）的高分辨率和长上下文长度对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）提出了巨大挑战，现有方法在资源消耗和生成能力上存在不足。

Method: 提出TCP-LLaVA，通过可训练的压缩令牌和模态压缩模块，将视觉和文本信息聚合为少量压缩令牌，仅将这些令牌输入语言模型以生成答案。

Result: 在十种TCGA肿瘤亚型的实验中，TCP-LLaVA在VQA准确性上优于现有基线，并显著降低了训练资源消耗。

Conclusion: TCP-LLaVA通过令牌压缩技术有效解决了WSI VQA中的计算资源问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing
training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖光流或深度估计，而事件数据稀疏且高时间分辨率，需更高效方法。

Method: 利用事件流数据，结合几何约束，通过优化流程进行分割和运动估计。

Result: 在EVIMO2v2数据集上验证了方法的准确性，无需完整光流计算。

Conclusion: 方法在物体边界表现优异，适合实时机器人及导航应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust framework for motion segmentation and
egomotion estimation using event-based normal flow, tailored specifically for
neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2
dataset validate that our method achieves accurate segmentation and
translational motion estimation without requiring full optical flow
computation. This approach demonstrates significant advantages at object
boundaries and offers considerable potential for scalable, real-time robotic
and navigation applications.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and view synthesis are foundational problems in computer
vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on

Result: 在稀疏视角、大规模和拥挤场景中，DCHM显著减少噪声，优于现有方法，并首次实现行人重建和多视角分割。

Conclusion: DCHM无需依赖人工标注，在多视角行人检测中表现出色，为复杂场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and
AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA

Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing
a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will

Result: 发现ANN困惑的刺激样本同样引发人类感知不确定性，通过微调ANN实现与人类感知模式的对齐。

Conclusion: 建立了ANN决策边界与人类感知变异性的系统性联系，为个性化情感解释建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.

Conclusion: 该系统通过灵活界面和准确算法，显著改善了用户的摄影体验和作品质量。

Abstract: Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.

Conclusion: 语言引导的关系表示对复杂室内场景理解有效。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

Result: 在24个预训练模型和10个下游数据集上表现优异，适应性强，包括低数据场景。

Conclusion: LEAD通过优化目标对齐和非线性建模，为模型选择提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high
potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of blood image analysis.
However, a detailed performance analysis of specific deep learning frameworks
appears to be lacking. This paper compares the performance of three popular
deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow with Keras, PyTorch, and JAX, in
classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset.
The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the
efficiency of these frameworks for medical image classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部表情识别在人机交互中有广泛应用，但面部属性的结构变化对识别至关重要，因此需要将结构信息融入面部属性中。

Method: 使用面部关键点作为图的顶点，基于邻近性和局部外观相似性确定边，结合视觉变换器和图卷积网络捕捉结构依赖关系。

Conclusion: Exp-Graph在实验室和现实环境中均表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法多为模态特定设计，适应性差，且SAM2在医学视频场景中需要大规模数据集重新训练，计算成本高。

Method: 提出DD-SAM2框架，结合Depthwise-Dilated Adapter，以最小参数开销增强多尺度特征提取，支持小规模数据微调。

Result: 在TrackRad2025和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上表现优异，Dice分数分别为0.93和0.97。

Conclusion: DD-SAM2为医学视频分割与追踪提供了一种高效适配方案，代码与模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

Result: 实验证明BusterX++在性能和泛化能力上表现优异。

Conclusion: BusterX++为跨模态合成媒体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and
real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS2Fusion提出了一种基于状态空间模型的双路径参数交互机制，有效解决了多光谱特征融合中的局部互补特征偏好和计算复杂度问题，显著提升了目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度关注局部互补特征而忽视跨模态共享语义，且难以平衡感受野大小与计算复杂度。

Method: 采用双路径参数交互机制：一路通过跨模态隐藏状态解码挖掘互补信息，另一路通过参数共享探索跨模态对齐。

Result: 在FLIR、M3FD和LLVIP等基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并在RGB-T语义分割和RGBT显著目标检测中表现优异。

Conclusion: MS2Fusion兼具功能互补性和共享语义空间，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport
Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick
detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge
inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key
actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while
improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not
limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation,
motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of
sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team
sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance
tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging
scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability,
and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards
across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.

Result: 在公开空间转录组数据集上，Gene-DML实现了最先进的基因表达预测性能。

Conclusion: Gene-DML通过学习鲁棒的跨模态表示，显著提升了预测精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

Result: 在Ov-SWiG和HICO-DET数据集上，MIPD在可见、罕见和未见场景中均表现出色，并提升了未见场景的检测能力。

Conclusion: MIPD通过知识蒸馏有效提升了小模型的泛化和零样本能力，为复杂GSR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis

affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.

Conclusion: InterAct VideoQA为智能交通系统中的视频问答研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic
scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal
dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for
VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to
facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for
intelligent transportation systems. GitHub Repo:

Motivation: 当前视频问答方法存在任务无关采样和启发式检索的缺陷，无法有效处理关键事件和因果关系，限制了复杂问题的解答能力。

Method: LeAdQA利用LLM优化问题-选项对以消除因果模糊性，并通过时间定位模型精确检索关键片段，结合自适应融合机制和MLLM生成答案。

Result: 在NExT-QA、IntentQA和NExT-GQA数据集上，LeAdQA实现了最先进的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: LeAdQA通过因果感知和视觉定位的协同作用，显著提升了视频问答的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical
moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer
semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: FOCUS框架解决了Vision Transformers在HSI数据中解释性差的问题，通过类特定光谱提示和[SINK]令牌生成稳定的3D显著性图和光谱重要性曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI数据的高维性和现有显著性方法的局限性导致ViTs在HSI中的解释性差，FOCUS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FOCUS引入类特定光谱提示和[SINK]令牌，通过单次前向传递生成显著性图和光谱曲线，无需梯度反向传播。

Result: FOCUS提高了波段级IoU 15%，减少注意力崩溃40%，且结果与专家标注高度一致。

Conclusion: FOCUS以不到1%的参数开销，实现了高分辨率ViT解释性，填补了黑盒建模与可信HSI决策之间的空白。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下采样方法可能导致关键空间信息丢失，影响像素级预测精度。

Method: 使用MinMaxPooling替代传统方法，保留图像的明暗对比和细节特征。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上，HPD的平均DSC系数提高了0.5%。

Conclusion: HPD模块为语义分割任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因顺序去噪导致高采样延迟，现有加速方法在低延迟预算下图像质量下降。

Method: EPD利用多个并行梯度评估优化ODE步长，通过蒸馏方式学习少量参数，支持插件式改进现有ODE采样器。

Result: 在5 NFE延迟下，EPD在多个数据集上FID显著优于现有学习型求解器。

Conclusion: EPD是一种高效且通用的ODE求解器，显著提升扩散模型的采样质量和速度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

Method: 在UseGeo数据集的航空影像块上评估预训练的DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT模型，进行姿态估计和密集3D重建。

Result: 模型能从极稀疏图像集（分辨率最高518像素）重建点云，完整性比COLMAP提升50%，VGGT计算效率更高。但高分辨率和大图像集时姿态估计可靠性下降。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法无法完全替代传统SfM和MVS，但在低分辨率、稀疏场景下可作为补充。

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

Abstract: Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.

Motivation: 多脸深度伪造视频在自然社交场景中日益普遍，现有方法因缺乏对上下文线索的关注而表现不佳。

Method: 通过人类研究识别四种关键线索，并开发HICOM框架，结合LLM提供可解释性。

Result: HICOM在基准数据集上平均准确率提升3.3%，泛化能力优于现有方法5.8%。

Conclusion: 结合人类因素可有效增强对深度伪造的防御，HICOM展示了这一潜力。

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.

Motivation: 扩散模型计算成本高，现有后训练量化方法依赖特定架构启发式，通用性差，难以集成到工业部署流程中。

Method: SegQuant包含段感知的图基量化策略（SegLinear）和双尺度量化方案（DualScale），分别捕捉结构语义与空间异质性，并保持极性不对称激活。

Result: SegQuant在多种扩散模型上表现优异，兼容主流部署工具。

Conclusion: SegQuant为扩散模型提供了一种高效、通用的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.

performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs

Conclusion: PHATNet通过域适应方法有效解决了去雾模型在未见数据上的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法在无需密集标签或多帧数据下实现了高质量的深度补全。

Abstract: Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that
grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language
via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike
prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time
and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation
model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost.
Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video
restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting,
three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation
benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow
intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We
compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on
all benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Abstract: Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BeatFormer是一种轻量级光谱注意力模型，结合了手工方法和深度学习的优势，用于远程光电容积描记（rPPG）估计，并通过光谱对比学习（SCL）实现无标签训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG方法中，手工方法依赖生理先验但性能受限，深度学习方法需要大量数据。需要结合两者优势以提高性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出BeatFormer模型，整合了缩放正交复数注意力和频域能量测量，并引入SCL实现无标签训练。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG和MMPD数据集上验证，BeatFormer在跨数据集评估和运动场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: BeatFormer通过结合手工方法和深度学习的优势，实现了高效且鲁棒的rPPG估计，尤其在无标签训练和复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法依赖多模态分离编码器，导致模型复杂且训练效率低。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义感知表示学习（SARL）方法，用于多标签图像分类，通过语义相关特征学习和最优传输注意力机制提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法（如注意力机制或图卷积网络）在图像表示中可能包含噪声且无法精确定位对象。

Method: 1. 使用标签语义相关特征学习模块提取特征；2. 设计基于最优传输的注意力机制；3. 采用区域分数聚合策略进行多标签预测。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SARL优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARL通过语义对齐和噪声抑制，显著提升了多标签图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer
vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image.
Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D高斯几何和外观预测上耦合度高，依赖数据驱动先验且回归速度慢，计算资源需求大。

Method: 使用立体视觉骨干网络提取局部图像对特征，通过全局注意力块融合，生成多视点几何和高斯特征，结合为GS-maps表示3D对象，并通过细化网络提升重建质量。

Result: 实现了无姿态的3D重建，提高了鲁棒性和实用性，同时减少了资源需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际3D内容生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维尺度分析（MDS）的冷冻电镜姿态估计方法，通过鲁棒优化和迭代平移校正提高3D重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜图像信噪比极低，导致姿态估计和重建精度不足，影响3D重建质量。

Method: 利用MDS技术从二面角对中估计旋转矩阵，采用鲁棒优化框架（ℓ1范数）和迭代平移校正算法。

Result: 在欧拉角精度和重建保真度（FSC）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在低信噪比下显著提升了姿态估计和重建的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像分类中，标记数据稀缺，MIL方法通过注意力机制聚合实例级表示，但现有方法通常确定性处理注意力值，忽略了实例贡献的不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种概率框架，估计注意力值的概率分布，同时考虑全局和局部交互。

Conclusion: 该概率框架不仅提升了预测性能，还通过不确定性映射增强了疾病定位的可解释性。

Abstract: The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.

Conclusion: MICU方法在开放集跨模态泛化任务中表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式设备在计算和能源预算有限的情况下，需要高效的多标签视频分类方法。视频流的结构特性（如标签稀疏性、时间连续性和标签共现）可被利用以优化推理效率。

Method: Polymorph框架动态选择和组合轻量级LoRA适配器，每个适配器专注于基于共现模式的子类，避免全模型切换和权重合并。

Result: 在TAO数据集上，Polymorph能耗降低40%，mAP提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: Polymorph通过模块化策略显著提升了嵌入式设备上的视频分类效率，同时开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.
Polymorph is open source at https://github.com/inference-serving/polymorph/.

Result: 结合GeoTransformer，在3DLoMatch基准上达到86.97%的配准召回率，并在ETH数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了现有PCR方法的性能，并展示了强泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-overlap point cloud registration (PCR) remains a significant challenge in
3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在下游任务中保持泛化能力仍具挑战性，现有提示学习方法存在模态隔离和层次语义衰减的瓶颈。

Result: 在四个任务的11个基准测试中取得最优性能，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: HiCroPL通过跨模态交互和分层语义融合，有效提升了模型的泛化能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图像回归任务中使用预设词汇和通用提示，未能利用文本输入的语义理解，性能与仅图像模型相当。

Method: 提出RvTC方法，通过分箱分类替代词汇约束分类，并引入数据特定提示以利用跨模态语义信息。

Result: 在四个图像评估数据集上实现最优性能，AVA数据集中提示添加挑战标题将相关性从0.83提升至0.90。

Conclusion: 语义提示信息对MLLMs在跨模态回归任务中至关重要，超越统计偏差，需结合有意义的文本上下文。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.

Abstract: Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于B-Spline曲线拟合的优化方法，用于改进FastSAM在图像分割中的锯齿边缘问题，提升边缘质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FastSAM虽然实现了实时分割，但其生成的边缘存在锯齿问题，影响分割精度和视觉效果。

Method: 采用B-Spline曲线拟合技术，通过四阶段优化过程（包括两轮曲线拟合）平滑锯齿边缘。

Result: 显著提升了边缘的视觉质量和分析准确性，同时保持了实时处理能力。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了FastSAM的实用性，扩展了其在工业自动化、医疗成像等领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型的基准测试未能充分反映其在视频理解中与人类智能的差距，尤其是在正确性和鲁棒性方面。

Method: 提出Video-TT，包含1,000个YouTube Shorts视频，每个视频配有一个开放式问题和四个对抗性问题，以评估模型对复杂视觉叙事的理解和鲁棒性。

Result: 评估显示视频LLMs在视频理解上与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Video-TT揭示了视频LLMs在真实世界视频理解中的不足，强调了提升其正确性和鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being
foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language
models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between
these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four
adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our
evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.

Result: OpenBreastUS首次实现了基于神经算子的人体乳腺高效体内成像。

Conclusion: OpenBreastUS为开发创新的神经PDE求解器提供了平台，并推动了其在真实医学成像中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

Motivation: 水下图像增强对海洋保护至关重要，但现有AI模型存在数据集偏差、高计算成本和透明度不足的问题，可能导致误判。

Method: EBA-AI利用CLIP嵌入检测和缓解偏差，结合自适应处理优化能效，同时引入不确定性估计和可解释性技术。

Conclusion: EBA-AI在效率、公平性和可解释性方面取得平衡，为可持续、低偏差的海洋保护提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly
coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to
sustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation
efforts. For interactive visualizations, animations, source code, and access to

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有虚拟试穿技术在跨域泛化和数据偏差方面的局限性，提出一种统一的训练免费解决方案。

Method: 引入服装先验生成机制和连续边界缝合技术以保留细节，利用DDIM反演实现精确姿势对齐。

Result: 在多样化数据集和场景中表现优异，首次实现多人虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: OmniVTON通过解耦服装和姿势约束，显著提升了虚拟试穿的通用性和真实性。

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

Motivation: 挑战当前全色锐化领域大模型计算开销高且泛化性差的问题，提出更高效、通用的解决方案。

Method: 设计PanTiny框架，采用多数据集联合训练（WV2、WV3、GF2）和复合损失函数。

Result: PanTiny在性能和效率上优于大多数大模型，显著提升全分辨率数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过模型设计、训练范式和损失函数的优化，证明了轻量高效模型可以超越复杂大模型。

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

TL;DR: StableAnimator++ 是一种基于视频扩散模型的框架，通过可学习的姿态对齐和身份保持技术，解决了现有方法在人体图像动画中身份一致性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人体图像动画扩散模型在参考图像和驱动视频差异较大时难以保持身份一致性，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: StableAnimator++ 结合了可学习的姿态对齐模块、全局内容感知的面部编码器和分布感知的身份适配器，并在推理阶段引入了基于 HJB 的面部优化。

Result: 实验证明，StableAnimator++ 在定性和定量上均表现出色，能够生成高质量且身份一致的视频。

Conclusion: StableAnimator++ 通过创新的模块设计和优化方法，显著提升了人体图像动画中身份一致性的保持能力。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电子社会中，文本图像结合了视觉美学和语言语义，但其生成和编辑具有挑战性。本文旨在评估现有生成模型在此领域的表现，并推动其作为通用技能的发展。

Method: 通过33个代表性任务（分为五类）和六种模型（开源和闭源）的评估，结合OCR任务，全面分析生成模型的性能。

Result: 研究发现当前生成模型在OCR任务中存在弱点，并提出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 逼真文本图像生成和编辑应作为通用生成模型的基础技能，而非依赖专用解决方案。

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.

Conclusion: 结合大规模数据集和旋转等变网络显著提升了无人机vPR的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.

Motivation: ESD术中出血的实时定位和持续监测需求迫切，但现有AI方法仅关注出血区域分割，缺乏对出血源检测和跟踪的研究，且缺乏专用数据集。

Method: 引入BleedOrigin-Bench数据集，并提出双阶段检测-跟踪框架BleedOrigin-Net，结合检测和跟踪技术，覆盖出血全过程。

Result: BleedOrigin-Net在出血起始检测、初始源定位和点跟踪方面表现优异，准确率分别达到96.85%、70.24%和96.11%。

Conclusion: BleedOrigin-Net填补了ESD术中出血源检测和跟踪的空白，为AI辅助系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is

Conclusion: VideoPlan方法在VPA任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made

Motivation: 事件数据的高稀疏性和异步性在转换为密集张量时会丧失优势，现有图方法对时空动态建模不足，限制了性能。

Method: 构建解耦的空间图（B样条基函数建模全局结构）和时间图（运动向量注意力建模局部动态），用高效2D核替代3D核。

Result: 在Gen1和eTraM数据集上，检测精度提升6%，速度提升5倍，参数减少且计算成本不变。

Conclusion: 结构化图建模有效提升了异步视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous

models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.

### [87] [Improving Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Diffusion Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15216)
*Yuping Qiu,Rui Zhu,Ying-cong Chen*

TL;DR: 论文提出N-JEPA方法，将扩散噪声引入掩码图像建模（MIM），结合自监督学习（SSL）和生成模型，提升特征表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在判别任务中表现优异，但生成模型在图像生成和细节增强上更优。论文旨在结合两者的优势，增强SSL的表示能力。

Method: 提出N-JEPA方法，通过扩散噪声（视为掩码状态）与MIM结合，利用多级噪声调度增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在分类任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: N-JEPA成功结合SSL与生成模型，为特征学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性对临床采用至关重要。

Method: 通过训练一个基于Mammo-CLIP的patch级稀疏自编码器（Mammo-SAE），识别和探测与临床相关乳腺概念（如肿块和可疑钙化）相关的潜在特征。

Result: 研究发现，SAE潜在空间中激活度最高的神经元通常与真实区域对齐，并揭示了影响模型决策的混杂因素。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可解释的SAE潜在表征有助于深入理解乳腺影像基础模型的内部工作机制。

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,
where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本学习中因参数过多导致的过拟合问题。

Result: 在BSCD-FSL基准测试中表现优异，尤其在极端域偏移场景下。

Conclusion: CP和SSTs的组合有效提升了跨域少样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model
pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

Result: 实验表明，FreeCus在无需额外训练的情况下，实现了与现有方法相当或更优的主题合成效果。

Conclusion: FreeCus成功解锁了DiT的零样本能力，为高质量主题驱动合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于近似盲PnP的对应学习方法（MinCD-PnP），通过最小化学习到的2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离，解决了传统微分PnP对噪声和异常值敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微分PnP在图像到点云（I2P）注册中对噪声和异常值高度敏感，影响了对应学习的有效性。

Method: 提出MinCD-PnP方法，简化盲PnP为最小化Chamfer距离的任务，并设计轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，MinCD-Net在跨场景和跨数据集设置中均优于现有方法，提高了内点比率（IR）和注册召回率（RR）。

Conclusion: MinCD-PnP和MinCD-Net有效提升了I2P注册的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

Motivation: 利用条件扩散模型在人类视觉感知对齐方面的优势，优化视频压缩的感知重建质量。

Method: 设计了多粒度条件模块、紧凑表示模块和多条件训练模块，将视频压缩任务转化为条件生成任务。

Result: 在FVD和LPIPS等感知质量指标上显著优于传统和神经编解码器，尤其在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为视频压缩提供了感知优化的新方向，尤其在高质量压缩场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物理和数字攻击检测中表现优异，优于某些传统CNN模型，且无需资源密集型训练。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物识别系统中的攻击检测提供了一种泛化能力强且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.

Result: 在多种指纹数据集上表现优异，达到最先进水平，同时保持高效计算。

Conclusion: DMD方法具有强大的泛化能力和潜力，适用于大规模指纹识别。

Abstract: Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding
code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Yy/DMD.

Motivation: 少样本目标检测（FSOD）中训练样本有限，现有方法难以准确提取有效通道特征，表现为高权重通道未必有效，低权重通道可能仍有价值。

Method: 提出SCSM模块，包括空间特征建模（SFM）平衡空间与通道关系学习，以及基于Mamba的通道状态建模（CSM）学习通道相关性。

Result: 在VOC和COCO数据集上的实验表明，SCSM模块显著提升了特征表示质量，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SCSM模块通过建模通道相关性，有效解决了FSOD中的特征提取问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.

Conclusion: ExDD框架通过双分布建模和合成数据生成，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能，解决了数据稀缺和异常分布假设问题。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

Abstract: The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our
human-centric synthetic dataset and trained models are available at

Conclusion: ORSANet通过多模态融合和动态损失设计，显著提升了遮挡条件下的FER性能。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX

*Jiaao Li,Kaiyuan Li,Chen Gao,Yong Li,Xinlei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EgoPrune的训练无关的token剪枝方法，专门用于提升egomotion视频推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: egomotion视频是具身AI代理的主要视觉输入，但现有方法计算成本高且不适合其连续性特点。

Method: EgoPrune包括关键帧选择、视角感知冗余过滤和基于MMR的token选择。

Result: 在两个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著降低计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: EgoPrune在边缘设备上验证了其实际效率和适用性。

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.

TL;DR: RAda是一种简单有效的微调方法，通过动态校准融合表示来提升视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了融合表示在决策中的关键作用，RAda旨在填补这一空白。

Method: RAda使用轻量级注意力层生成学习掩码，动态调整融合表示中每个元素的贡献。

Result: 在不同设置下，RAda均能提升基线性能，且与现有方法表现相当。

Conclusion: RAda是一种通用且高效的微调技术，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂森林环境中的异常检测提供了新工具和方法，支持未来搜救行动。

Abstract: After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and

LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式文本到视频检索方法缺乏对不确定性的量化，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出UMIVR框架，使用语义熵（TAS）、Jensen-Shannon散度（MUS）和时序质量采样器（TQFS）量化不确定性，并生成针对性问题。

Result: 在MSR-VTT-1k数据集上，经过10轮交互后Recall@1达到69.2%。

Conclusion: UMIVR为交互式文本到视频检索提供了不确定性最小化的基础，显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在非均匀光照场景（如背光和阴影）中表现不佳，导致过曝或亮度恢复不足。

Method: 提出动态积分图像表示建模空间变化光照，构建SAI²E估计器，并引入IG-MSA机制校准光照相关特征。

Result: 在五个标准低光数据集和跨域基准（LOL-Blur）上，SAIGFormer在定量和定性指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAIGFormer在非均匀光照增强中表现优异，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了自监督程序学习中的关键问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.

Conclusion: 整合工具-动作-目标组合和手部身份信息能显著提升手术场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，未见动词设置下达到27.91的mAP，创下新记录。

Conclusion: HOLa通过特征分解和权重适应，显著提升了零样本HOI检测的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理视频时空信息时存在分离问题，快速移动对象的空间信息难以准确表示，导致时空交互不准确，影响视频理解。

Method: 提出DynImg方法，利用非关键帧作为时间提示，突出快速移动对象的空间区域，并采用4D视频旋转位置嵌入保持时空顺序。

Result: 实验表明DynImg在多个视频理解基准上超越现有方法约2%。

Conclusion: DynImg通过时间提示和4D嵌入有效提升了视频理解的时空交互准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.

Motivation: 传统Mixup的像素级插值生成的图像不真实，可能阻碍学习，尤其在医学等高风险应用中。

Method: 使用StyleGAN2-ADA生成器，通过Dirichlet和Beta分布采样标签向量，生成连续类流形上的图像。

Result: 在COVIDx-CT-3数据集上，GeMix结合真实数据显著提升了分类性能（Macro-F1），降低了COVID-19检测的假阴性率。

Conclusion: GeMix是传统Mixup的直接替代方案，提供更强的正则化和语义保真度，且不破坏现有训练流程。

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现卫星上端到端变化检测，为实时应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.

Motivation: 现有VLA依赖合成数据或有限的操作演示，难以处理高灵巧性任务和新场景。利用人类手的灵巧性和网络数据的规模优势，提出新方法以突破数据瓶颈。

Conclusion: 通过物理指令调优和多样化数据整合，Being-H0显著提升了VLA在复杂操作任务中的表现，为机器人灵巧操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的混合方法，用于稀疏视图图像的三维重建和新视角渲染，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图图像的三维重建和新视角渲染存在挑战，SDF方法在细节处理上不足，而3DGS方法缺乏全局几何一致性。

Method: 结合SDF和3DGS的优势：SDF捕捉粗几何结构以增强3DGS渲染，3DGS渲染的新图像细化SDF的细节。

Result: 在DTU和MobileBrick数据集上，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效解决了稀疏视图重建的挑战，代码将开源。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are
challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine
details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global
geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses
state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis
on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets. Code will be released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于圆柱坐标系的隐式表示方法CylinderPlane，解决了Tri-plane表示中的多视角一致性问题，实现了高质量、无伪影的360°图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tri-plane表示在3D感知图像生成中存在对称区域特征共享导致的多面伪影问题，限制了360°视图图像的生成能力。

Method: 采用圆柱坐标系构建隐式表示，通过嵌套圆柱结构捕获多尺度特征，提升复杂几何和分辨率的适应性。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实图像上实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CylinderPlane解决了Tri-plane的局限性，实现了高质量的360°图像生成，且易于集成到现有神经渲染流程中。

Abstract: While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.

Motivation: 文化遗產音乐数字化的核心是OMR，但标注数据稀缺和历史手稿复杂性限制了其发展。

Method: 利用YOLOv8，系统选择预测置信度最低的样本进行迭代标注和重新训练，从单张标注图像开始。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著减少标注样本的情况下，达到了与全监督训练相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 在特定手稿中，基于不确定性的AL效果不佳，需探索更适用于数据稀缺场景的方法。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁信息完整性和社会信任，当前检测方法模型庞大且机制不明确，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 采用彩票假设（LTH）进行迭代幅度修剪，测试MesoNet、CNN-5和ResNet-18架构在OpenForensic和FaceForensics++数据集上的表现。

Result: MesoNet在80%稀疏度下保持56.2%准确率（基线62.6%），仅需3,000参数；LTH修剪方法优于一次性修剪。

Conclusion: LTH方法可高效识别关键子网络，支持可部署的深度伪造检测系统，且子网络具有跨数据集迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EVA的训练无关方法，通过动态选择中间层提取视觉事实信息，显著减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉识别和语言理解方面取得了进展，但仍存在对象幻觉问题，即模型生成看似合理但实际错误的输出。研究发现先验知识会抑制视觉信息，但中间层的具体机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出EVA方法，通过对比原始输入和纯文本输入的中间层输出分布，动态选择视觉事实信息最显著的层，并将其整合到最终层以修正输出。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，EVA显著降低了幻觉率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EVA是一种模型无关的方法，能有效减少MLLMs中的幻觉问题，且无需额外训练，适用于多种解码策略和模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted
features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

Conclusion: Hi²-GSLoc框架在遥感应用中具有高效性和实用性，为大规模场景的视觉重定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.

Motivation: 现有AI点云压缩方法依赖特定训练数据分布，限制了实际应用；INR方法虽能解决此问题，但受限于编码时间和解码器大小，仅支持有损压缩。

Method: 设计了点云级编码框架和高效网络初始化策略，减少60%编码时间；提出基于多尺度SparseConv的轻量级编码网络，实现快速推理和小解码器。

Result: 在MVUB数据集上，比特流比G-PCC TMC13v23减少21.21%，比SparsePCGC减少21.95%。

Conclusion: LINR-PCGC首次实现基于INR的无损点云压缩，显著优于传统和AI方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在重建高质量新视图时容易过拟合训练视图的高频细节，而传统的基于傅里叶变换的频率正则化方法存在参数调优困难和偏向高频学习的缺陷。

Method: DWTGS利用小波空间损失提供额外的空间监督，仅监督多级小波变换中的低频LL子带，并以自监督方式稀疏化高频HH子带。

Result: 实验表明，DWTGS在多个基准测试中优于基于傅里叶变换的方法，低频中心策略提高了泛化能力并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: DWTGS通过小波变换的频率正则化方法，有效解决了稀疏视图3DGS的高频过拟合问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

Conclusion: 论文为空间控制生成提供了实用建议，填补了知识空白，并强调了科学比较的重要性。

Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: TokensGen为长视频生成提供了可扩展的模块化解决方案，适用于影视制作和沉浸式模拟。

Abstract: Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.

Conclusion: HDF框架通过异质性感知和动态优化，有效提升了动态面部表情识别的性能，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法对所有错误等同惩罚，未能利用标签空间的语义信息，尤其在标签类别丰富时表现不佳。

Method: 提出两种基于树结构的语义损失函数，结合稀疏标注训练方法，应用于全监督和稀疏标注任务。

Result: 在头MRI全脑分割和神经外科高光谱成像任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 树结构语义损失函数能有效提升医学图像分割性能，尤其在复杂标签场景下表现优越。

Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整低秩适应（LoRA）的方法，通过引入稀疏正则化器自动选择任务适应的秩，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法需要固定秩，难以适应不同医学图像任务的复杂性，因此需要一种动态调整秩的方法。

Method: 通过将低秩权重矩阵视为奇异值分解，引入l_1稀疏正则化器，并使用近端优化器动态调整秩。

Result: 在少样本微调实验中，该方法显著优于标准LoRA和其他PEFT方法，表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态调整秩的方法在医学图像分割中具有显著优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

Abstract: The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
These findings contribute to more efficient and scalable neural networks for
the low-parameter range and advance the understanding of bottlenecks in

Conclusion: ConformalSAM通过有效利用预训练模型和不确定性校准，显著提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态上下文学习（MICL）中倾向于忽略视觉线索，仅模仿文本模式，限制了其实际应用。如何有效提升MICL能力并可靠评估其性能尚待探索。

Method: 引入动态注意力重分配（DARA）策略，通过调整视觉和文本令牌的注意力权重，鼓励模型关注视觉内容；同时提出TrueMICL数据集，明确要求整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验证明，该解决方案显著提升了真正的多模态上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: DARA和TrueMICL有效解决了MLLMs在MICL中的视觉信息利用不足问题，为多模态学习提供了可靠评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

Conclusion: 扩散模型结合改进方法在多元地下建模和反演中具有高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多种条件数据。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Motivation: 当前T2V模型在物理常识方面表现不足，生成的视频常违反因果关系、物体行为和工具使用等直觉预期，因此需要一种评估方法填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PhysVidBench基准，包含383个提示，采用三阶段评估流程：1）从提示中提出物理问题；2）用视觉语言模型为生成视频生成字幕；3）让语言模型基于字幕回答物理问题。

Result: 通过间接评估策略，避免了直接视频评估中的幻觉问题，突出了工具使用和材料属性等关键领域。

Conclusion: PhysVidBench为评估生成视频模型的物理常识提供了一个结构化、可解释的框架，填补了现有评估的不足。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.

Result: 在SeCVOS基准测试中，SeC比SAM 2.1提升了11.8个百分点，达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: SeC通过概念驱动的方法显著提升了视频对象分割的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

Motivation: 现代生成模型共享类似的训练目标（从噪声输入重建干净信号），但视觉分词器的有效属性尚不明确。作者希望通过对齐分词器嵌入与去噪目标，提升生成效果。

Method: 提出l-DeTok，通过训练分词器从被插值噪声和随机掩码污染的潜在嵌入中重建干净图像。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，l-DeTok在六种代表性生成模型中均优于标准分词器。

Conclusion: 去噪是分词器设计的基本原则，未来分词器设计可基于此视角展开。

Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI提供了更接近人类智能的自发决策能力，有望提升其适应性和创造力。

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on
algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,
human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make
unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or
immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might
be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in
problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free
Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI
agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their
decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive
state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses
probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a
quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms
analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to
improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen
changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment
demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy
diversity compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation
techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of
training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To
address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for
Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for
DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent
with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic
DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error
handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their
discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS
capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average
errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we
apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating
its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again
reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,
DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian
ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at
the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS
approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design
space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and
intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput,
high-fidelity computational materials discovery.

doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

TL;DR: OnT是一种新的本体嵌入方法，通过结合预训练语言模型和双曲空间几何建模，有效整合文本标签并保留逻辑结构，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本体嵌入方法要么忽略文本信息，要么无法保留逻辑结构，限制了性能和应用潜力。

Method: OnT通过双曲空间几何建模调整预训练语言模型，结合文本标签并保留EL描述逻辑的类层次和逻辑关系。

Result: 在四个真实本体上的实验表明，OnT在公理预测和推理任务中均优于现有方法，并展现出强大的迁移学习和实际应用能力。

Conclusion: OnT在整合文本与逻辑结构方面表现出色，为构建新本体提供了有效工具。

Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies which are able to formally represent
complex knowledge and support semantic reasoning have been widely adopted
across various domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Recently,
ontology embeddings have gained wide attention due to its potential to infer
plausible new knowledge and approximate complex reasoning. However, existing
methods face notable limitations: geometric model-based embeddings typically
overlook valuable textual information, resulting in suboptimal performance,
while the approaches that incorporate text, which are often based on language
models, fail to preserve the logical structure. In this work, we propose a new
ontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM)
via geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating
textual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other
logical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four
real-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines
including the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of
axioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications,
indicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real
cases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT. Data and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型通用模型或小型专用模型，各有局限性，且训练大型专用模型需要大量计算资源。

Method: ProofCompass通过LLM提供自然语言证明策略和失败分析，指导专用证明器（如DSP-v1.5），无需额外训练。

Result: 在miniF2F基准测试中，ProofCompass性能优于DSP-v1.5（54.9%→55.3%），且尝试次数减少25倍（3200→128）。

Conclusion: 该方法为同时提高形式化定理证明的计算效率和准确性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Language models have become increasingly powerful tools for formal
mathematical reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely exclusively on
either large general-purpose models or smaller specialized models, each with
distinct limitations, while training specialized large models still requires
significant computational resources. This paper introduces ProofCompass, a
novel hybrid methodology that achieves remarkable computational efficiency by
strategically guiding existing specialized prover methods, such as
DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5-RL (DSP-v1.5) with a Large Language Model (LLM) without
requiring additional model training. The LLM provides natural language proof
strategies and analyzes failed attempts to select intermediate lemmas, enabling
effective problem decomposition. On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass
demonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\%
\rightarrow 55.3\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \rightarrow 128$).
Our synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving
computational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在解决新问题时表现不佳，倾向于记忆而非真正推理，泛化能力有限。

Method: 引入Nexus Architect，结合自动化工作流合成和迭代提示优化，生成定制化推理流程。

Result: 在逻辑问题数据集上，Nexus Architect性能优于现有LRMs，最高提升66%通过率。

Conclusion: Nexus Architect通过创新机制显著提升了推理模型的泛化能力和任务表现。

Abstract: The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) promises a significant leap forward
in language model capabilities, aiming to tackle increasingly sophisticated
tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. However, despite their
impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted how current reasoning
models frequently fail to generalize to novel, unseen problems, often resorting
to memorized solutions rather than genuine inferential reasoning. Such behavior
underscores a critical limitation in modern LRMs, i.e., their tendency toward
overfitting, which in turn results in poor generalization in problem-solving
capabilities.
  In this paper, we introduce Nexus Architect, an enhanced iteration of our
multi-agent system framework, Nexus, equipped with a novel automated workflow
synthesis mechanism. Given a user's prompt and a small set of representative
examples, the Architect autonomously generates a tailored reasoning workflow by
selecting suitable strategies, tool integrations, and adversarial techniques
for a specific problem class. Furthermore, the Architect includes an iterative
prompt refinement mechanism that fine-tunes agents' system prompts to maximize
performance and improve the generalization capabilities of the system.
  We empirically evaluate Nexus Architect by employing an off-the-shelf,
non-reasoning model on a custom dataset of challenging logical questions and
compare its performance against state-of-the-art LRMs. Results show that Nexus
Architect consistently outperforms existing solutions, achieving up to a 66%
increase in pass rate over Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, nearly 2.5$\times$ against
Claude Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek-R1, and over 3$\times$ w.r.t. Llama 4 Scout.

TL;DR: 通过结合推理模型与人类专家的协作，以及引入非推理模型快速筛选问题，显著降低了错误率和延迟，同时节省成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感领域，AI模型的错误率需接近0%，而现有推理模型仍存在错误率高和延迟大的问题。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）推理模型通过不确定性量化将不确定问题转交人类专家；2）引入非推理模型快速筛选问题，减少推理模型的负担。

Result: 错误率从3%降至1%以下，延迟降低40%，成本节省50%，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过系统工程技术，无需修改模型内部即可显著改善推理模型的错误率和延迟问题。

Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still
occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive
domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose
collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries
the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty
of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an
effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3
235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring
7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them
challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this
challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning
model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask",
since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert
directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher
latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and
about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the
accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower
than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier
queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency
distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the
deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and
high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems
engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.

TL;DR: 研究发现，延长大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理长度会降低性能，揭示了测试计算量与准确性之间的反比关系，并识别了五种失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨测试计算量扩展对模型推理能力的影响，揭示潜在问题模式。

Method: 构建四类评估任务（计数、回归、演绎、AI风险），分析模型在不同推理长度下的表现。

Result: 发现五种失败模式，如分心、过拟合、虚假相关性等，表明计算量扩展可能强化问题推理模式。

Conclusion: 需多样化评估推理长度以识别和解决LRMs的失败模式，计算量扩展需谨慎。

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling
relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span
four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with
spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI
risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:
1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)
OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)
models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models
show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)
extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4
showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that
while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model
capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse
reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

Motivation: 企业环境中代理系统的部署常因缺乏领域特定知识导致执行不稳定，Routine旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Routine通过结构化规划、明确指令和无缝参数传递，指导代理执行多步骤工具调用任务。

Result: 在真实企业场景中，Routine将GPT-4o和Qwen3-14B的执行准确率分别提升至96.3%和83.3%，并通过微调进一步优化。

Conclusion: Routine有效提升了代理系统的稳定性和适应性，加速了企业环境中代理系统的部署。

Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often
hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process
knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution
stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent
planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and
seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing
multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted
within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the
execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o
from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed
a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an
accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating
improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based
distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.
Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,
approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's
effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing
model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent
workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in
enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

Motivation: 生物医学知识图谱的完成和推理具有挑战性，现有方法在语义理解和结构学习之间缺乏协同进化。

Method: BioGraphFusion通过张量分解建立全局语义基础，结合LSTM动态优化关系嵌入，并通过查询引导子图构建和混合评分机制增强学习。

Result: 在三个关键生物医学任务中表现优于现有方法，并通过案例研究验证了其生物学意义。

Conclusion: BioGraphFusion为生物医学知识图谱的语义和结构学习提供了深度协同的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery
and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging.
Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with
dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel
locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches,
including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep,
adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and
structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous,
reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is
paramount.
  Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply
synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a
global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven
mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation.
This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural
learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid
scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate
BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and
ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1)
highlights its ability to unveil biologically meaningful pathways.

Method: 引入VISOTHELLO模型，结合移动历史和棋盘图像进行多模态训练，通过下一步移动预测与单模态基线对比。

Result: 多模态训练显著提升模型性能和内部表征的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉输入有助于语言模型推断结构化世界表征。

Abstract: Language models are often said to face a symbol grounding problem. While some
argue that world understanding can emerge from text alone, others suggest
grounded learning is more efficient. We explore this through Othello, where the
board state defines a simplified, rule-based world. Building on prior work, we
introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board
images. Using next-move prediction, we compare it to mono-modal baselines and
test robustness to semantically irrelevant perturbations. We find that
multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal
representations. These results suggest that grounding language in visual input
helps models infer structured world representations.

Result: 实验验证表明，CHS能处理情感冲突状态和复杂心理场景，填补了传统模型的盲点。

Conclusion: CHS为AI情感建模提供了新的数学基础，解决了传统模型的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework
for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position
eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical
computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector
operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps
in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system
that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The
framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports
real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system
introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically
integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors.
This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of
textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide
nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions
include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are
insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system
that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for
emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space,
and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition
with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation
through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally
conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological
scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately
represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion
modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: 比较学习方法比基于回归的方法更高效，且降低了人类的认知负担。

Abstract: Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development.
Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help
developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points
collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the
initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team
has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious
and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with
enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,
state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate
predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The
goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a
comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story
point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to
every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate
which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine
learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically
evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.
The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground
truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of
a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the
proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art
regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -
providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than
providing ratings or categorical labels.

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown
how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of
autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could
also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI
systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world
situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a
flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized
coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:
misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that
decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than
centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them
to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional
interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can
adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these
malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and
countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

TL;DR: Neo是一个可配置的多代理框架，用于自动化评估基于LLM的系统，通过动态生成多样化的测试输入，显著提高了测试效率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准和手动测试无法满足LLM代理复杂、上下文敏感行为的评估需求，因此需要一种自动化、动态的测试框架。

Method: Neo结合了问题生成代理和评估代理，通过共享上下文中心模块化地组合领域提示、场景控制和动态反馈，并使用概率状态模型生成多样化的测试输入。

Result: 在测试生产级聊天机器人时，Neo发现了边缘案例故障，测试效率比人工高10-12倍，且覆盖范围更广。

Conclusion: Neo为可扩展、自进化的LLM质量评估奠定了基础，其框架具有模型无关性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive
behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing
obsolete.
  We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates
realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question
Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing
domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed
modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning
dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like
conversations that adapt after every turn.
  Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i)
uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break
rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered
10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45
mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic
policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader
behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.
  Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent
interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and
extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release

### [160] [Automated Safety Evaluations Across 20 Large Language Models: The Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14719)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Aymara AI是一个用于生成和管理定制化、基于政策的安全评估的平台，通过将自然语言安全政策转化为对抗性提示，并使用AI评分器评估模型响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在现实应用中的普及，需要可扩展且严格的安全评估方法。

Method: Aymara AI将自然语言安全政策转化为对抗性提示，并使用基于AI的评分器（经人类验证）评估模型响应。

Result: 评估了20个商用LLM在10个安全领域的表现，结果显示性能差异显著，平均安全分数从86.2%到52.4%不等。

Conclusion: LLM的安全性具有不一致性和上下文依赖性，需要像Aymara AI这样的可扩展工具来支持负责任的AI开发和监管。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, scalable and rigorous safety evaluation is essential.
This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and
administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI
transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores
model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We
demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility
Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world
safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety
scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in
well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they
consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy
& Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety
scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p < .05). These
findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety
and highlight the need for scalable, customizable tools like Aymara AI to
support responsible AI development and oversight.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI（如VAEs、GANs、Transformer和扩散模型）在城市规划中的应用潜力，以解决地理空间、社会和人本约束下的土地利用配置问题。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析生成式AI在城市设计中的重塑作用，并识别当前研究的四大局限。

Result: 指出了当前研究的不足，包括缺乏城市理论指导、多空间分辨率研究不足、数据驱动的设计知识增强不足以及缺乏现实交互研究。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向，包括理论指导的生成、数字孪生和人机协同设计，呼吁生成智能与参与式城市规划的新结合。

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately
of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning
presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. This paper
conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes
land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric
constraints. We survey how generative AI approaches, including VAEs, GANs,
transformers, and diffusion models, reshape urban design. We further identify
critical gaps: 1) limited research on integrating urban theory guidance, 2)
limited research of AI urban planning over multiple spatial resolutions or
angularities, 3) limited research on augmenting urban design knowledge from
data, and 4) limited research on addressing real-world interactions. To address
these limitations, we outline future research directions in theory-guided
generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, calling for a new
synthesis of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理与强化学习的结合缺乏系统性研究，现有方法在扩展性和效率上存在不足。

Method: 开发了AgentFly框架，支持多轮交互和异步执行工具调用与奖励计算，采用装饰器接口定义工具和奖励函数。

Result: 框架在多任务中成功训练代理，展示了其高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AgentFly为语言模型代理与强化学习的结合提供了系统化解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have gained significant attention for their
ability to autonomously complete tasks through interactions with environments,
tools, and APIs. LM agents are primarily built with prompt engineering or
supervised finetuning. At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) has been
explored to enhance LM's capabilities, such as reasoning and factuality.
However, the combination of the LM agents and reinforcement learning (Agent-RL)
remains underexplored and lacks systematic study. To this end, we built
AgentFly, a scalable and extensible Agent-RL framework designed to empower LM
agents with a variety of RL algorithms. Our framework supports multi-turn
interactions by adapting traditional RL methods with token-level masking. It
features a decorator-based interface for defining tools and reward functions,
enabling seamless extension and ease of use. To support high-throughput
training, we implement asynchronous execution of tool calls and reward
computations, and design a centralized resource management system for scalable
environment coordination. We also provide a suite of prebuilt tools and
environments, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through successful
agent training across multiple tasks.

TL;DR: InsightX Agent是一个基于LMM的交互式、可解释的X射线无损检测框架，通过SDMSD和EGR工具提升检测可靠性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在X射线检测中缺乏交互性、可解释性和自我评估能力，限制了可靠性和操作员信任。

Method: 采用LMM作为核心协调器，结合SDMSD进行多尺度缺陷检测和EGR工具进行验证与优化。

Result: 在GDXray+数据集上达到96.35%的F1分数，显著提升可解释性和信任度。

Conclusion: InsightX Agent展示了基于LMM的代理框架在工业检测任务中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for
industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often
lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical
self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address
these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based
agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive
X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent
positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

TL;DR: LLMs在简单环境中初始表现优于传统RL方法，但在复杂场景中缺乏规划和推理能力，需进一步研究混合策略和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在自主决策中的适用性，尤其是在MDPs中的表现，以利用其预训练知识加速适应。

Method: 通过在线结构化提示策略，比较LLM与传统RL在序列决策任务中的零样本性能。

Result: LLMs在简单环境中表现更好，但在复杂环境中表现不佳，反馈机制可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究混合策略、微调和高级记忆集成以提升LLM的决策能力。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract context from natural
language problem descriptions naturally raises questions about their
suitability in autonomous decision-making settings. This paper studies the
behaviour of these models within a Markov Decision Process (MDPs). While
traditional reinforcement learning (RL) strategies commonly employed in this
setting rely on iterative exploration, LLMs, pre-trained on diverse datasets,
offer the capability to leverage prior knowledge for faster adaptation. We
investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision
making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to
that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs
demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle
with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or
additional guidance. Our results show that feedback mechanisms, intended to
improve decision-making, often introduce confusion, leading to diminished
performance in intricate environments. These insights underscore the need for
further exploration into hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory
integration to enhance LLM-based decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免AI取代人类角色并解决责任缺口问题，强调伦理与技术选择的结合。

Method: 采用双重镜像过程，通过三个原型应用（贷款审批、肺炎诊断、艺术风格识别）测试，结合XAI算法的反向解释部署。

Result: 用户感知到决策过程中的完全控制，实验显示问责与责任之间可以建立桥梁。

Conclusion: 该方法在用户体验和伦理层面取得成效，为AI部署提供了新的技术选择与哲学视角。

Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial
intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals
of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap
(Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the
relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol,
implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making
processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style
recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step
illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice
(Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical
account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of
XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results
of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical
accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was
perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared
that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of
damage.

Motivation: 全球老龄化问题需要创新解决方案，Agentic AI在老年护理中的自主决策能力可能带来变革，但目前缺乏相关研究。

Method: 通过分析Agentic AI的独特能力、应用和限制，填补文献空白，并提供一个交互式仪表盘。

Result: Agentic AI在老年护理中有巨大潜力，但也需关注隐私、伦理和透明性问题。

Conclusion: 需平衡Agentic AI的潜力与挑战，推动以人为中心的研究和应用。

Abstract: The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for
caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for
transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI),
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss the proactive and
autonomous decision-making facilitated by Agentic AI in elderly care.
Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management,
all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults,
represents important areas of application. With a potential for significant
transformation of elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about
data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key
insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and
transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced
discussion of both the potential and the challenges associated with Agentic AI,
and to provide insights into its responsible use in elderly care, to bring
Agentic AI into harmony with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to
the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research
communities, to achieve human-centered advancements and integration of Agentic
AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is no existing study
that reviews the role of Agentic AI in elderly care. Hence, we address the
literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and
limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care. We also provide a
companion interactive dashboard at https://hazratali.github.io/agenticai/.

Motivation: 命题溯因在AI和数据库等领域有广泛应用，但其复杂性问题（如计数和枚举）极具挑战性。研究旨在通过介于决策和计数之间的推理，更好地理解解释的变异性。

Method: 引入“facet”概念（解释中出现但不普遍存在的文字），并分析其在Post框架中的特性。还研究了解释之间的距离以量化异质性/同质性。

Result: 在Post框架中几乎完全表征了facet的特性，为命题溯因提供了更细粒度的理解。

Conclusion: facet和距离分析为命题溯因的变异性提供了新视角，同时保持了计算复杂性优势。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain
observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as
diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In
propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional
formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has
been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for
Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems
(counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore,
we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand
explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets
to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation
(relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets
provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations
(heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two
explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We
comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings,
including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaAlign是一个基于纯强化学习的框架，通过可验证的安全奖励激励大语言模型的安全意识，解决现有安全对齐方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在安全对齐后仍存在生成有害内容、过度拒绝和实用性下降的问题，现有方法未能充分利用模型内在的安全意识。

Method: AlphaAlign采用双奖励系统：可验证的安全奖励鼓励对有害查询的正确拒绝和明确理由，同时惩罚过度拒绝；标准化帮助性奖励指导对良性输入的高质量响应。

Result: AlphaAlign在简单性、效率和安全性-实用性平衡方面表现出色，提升了有害内容的拒绝能力，减少了过度拒绝，并保持了任务性能。

Conclusion: AlphaAlign通过主动安全推理实现了深度对齐，生成明确的安全理由，而非依赖浅层拒绝模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding
from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful
content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after
safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial
refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based
approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety
self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure
reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to
incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.}
AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages
correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while
penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides
high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop
proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised
safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages:
(1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and
minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility
trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals,
while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and
robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety
reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on
shallow refusal patterns.

Motivation: 在智能时代，心理测量测试在人员选拔、职业发展和心理健康评估中日益重要，强制选择测试因其能降低回答失真风险而常用。

Method: 通过非线性映射挖掘参与者和题目特征，用多层神经网络建模其交互，并利用单调性假设提升诊断结果的可解释性。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的实验验证了FCNCD的准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FCNCD模型有效克服了传统模型的局限性，适用于多种强制选择测试题型，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In the smart era, psychometric tests are becoming increasingly important for
personnel selection, career development, and mental health assessment.
Forced-choice tests are common in personality assessments because they require
participants to select from closely related options, lowering the risk of
response distortion. This study presents a deep learning-based Forced-Choice
Neural Cognitive Diagnostic Model (FCNCD) that overcomes the limitations of
traditional models and is applicable to the three most common item block types
found in forced-choice tests. To account for the unidimensionality of items in
forced-choice tests, we create interpretable participant and item parameters.
We model the interactions between participant and item features using
multilayer neural networks after mining them using nonlinear mapping. In
addition, we use the monotonicity assumption to improve the interpretability of
the diagnostic results. The FCNCD's effectiveness is validated by experiments
on real-world and simulated datasets that show its accuracy, interpretability,
and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于差分进化（DE）的方法，优化对抗性提示后缀以攻击RAG系统，实验表明其攻击成功率高且能逃避检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性提示攻击会显著影响RAG系统的可靠性，因此需要一种梯度无关的方法来优化对抗性后缀。

Method: 采用差分进化（DE）优化对抗性提示后缀，将其视为黑箱，并通过演化候选后缀来最大化目标错误文档的检索排名。

Result: 在BEIR QA数据集上的实验表明，DE方法在攻击成功率上优于GGPP和PRADA，且仅需少量标记（≤5）。此外，DE生成的后缀能有效逃避检测。

Conclusion: DE方法是一种高效且隐蔽的攻击手段，适用于现实场景中的RAG系统。

Abstract: Adversarial prompt attacks can significantly alter the reliability of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by re-ranking them to produce
incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a novel method that applies
Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for
RAG-based question answering. Our approach is gradient-free, treating the RAG
pipeline as a black box and evolving a population of candidate suffixes to
maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document to be closer to
real world scenarios. We conducted experiments on the BEIR QA datasets to
evaluate attack success at certain retrieval rank thresholds under multiple
retrieving applications. Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt
optimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates
compared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while
using only a small number of tokens (<=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix.
Furthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy,
validated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative
log-likelihood with Welch's t-test. Through evaluations with a BERT-based
adversarial suffix detector, we show that DE-generated suffixes evade
detection, yielding near-chance detection accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果推断的新型内在奖励CAIS，用于强化学习，以解决传统方法在噪声环境中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类婴儿能稳健地发现自身的因果效应，而传统强化学习代理在噪声环境中表现脆弱，依赖相关性奖励的方法失效。

Method: 引入Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS)，通过测量动作对感官结果分布的1-Wasserstein距离来量化动作的因果影响。

Result: 在模拟婴儿-移动环境中，CAIS能有效过滤噪声并学习正确策略，同时重现了“消退爆发”现象。

Conclusion: 明确推断因果性是发展稳健代理感的关键机制，为自适应自主系统提供了心理学合理的框架。

Abstract: While human infants robustly discover their own causal efficacy, standard
reinforcement learning agents remain brittle, as their reliance on
correlation-based rewards fails in noisy, ecologically valid scenarios. To
address this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel
intrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's
influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned
distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the
baseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward
that isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.
We test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where
correlation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is
subjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to
filter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.
Furthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our
agent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the
"extinction burst" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality
is a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a
psychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Standard automated planning employs first-order formulas under closed-world

We follow a line of research that aims to incorporate background knowledge into
automated planning problems, for example, by means of ontologies, which are
usually interpreted under open-world semantics. We present a new approach for
planning with DL-Lite ontologies that combines the advantages of ontology-based
action conditions provided by explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs)
and ontology-aware action effects under the coherence update semantics. We show
that the complexity of the resulting formalism is not higher than that of
previous approaches and provide an implementation via a polynomial compilation
into classical planning. An evaluation of existing and new benchmarks examines
the performance of a planning system on different variants of our compilation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔疾病诊断存在症状重叠的临床挑战，需要超越简单模式匹配的解决方案。

Method: 结合多模态CLIP模型和ChatGLM-6B语言模型，采用分层诊断推理树（HDRT）进行诊断，提供快速和标准两种模式。

Result: 在431张内部测试图像上，快速模式准确率为73.4%，标准模式提升至89.5%。

Conclusion: CSI框架通过分层推理显著提升诊断性能，为临床诊断提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The diagnosis of oral diseases presents a problematic clinical challenge,
characterized by a wide spectrum of pathologies with overlapping
symptomatology. To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence
(CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different
oral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert
clinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to
emulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic
aids.
  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a
specialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical
Diagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the
systematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates
in two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that
leverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.
  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310
images, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final
validation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training
data to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's
Fast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the
HDRT-driven Standard Mode. The performance gain is directly attributable to the
hierarchical reasoning process. Herein, we detail the architectural philosophy,
development, and rigorous evaluation of the CSI framework.

Motivation: 探索在The Line这种前所未有的城市拓扑中，公民是否能自由移动，并验证AI支持的城市设计的可行性。

Method: 开发了结合基于代理的建模、强化学习、监督学习和图神经网络的混合仿真框架，利用合成数据和高密度城市的真实数据模拟多模式交通行为。

Result: 实验显示，在完整AI架构下，平均通勤时间为7.8至8.4分钟，满意度超过89%，可达性指数超过91%。移除智能模块会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在The Line中实现自由移动不仅是概念上可行的，而且在AI系统、可持续基础设施和实时反馈的支持下具有操作现实性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a
proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess
whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we
develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling,
reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The
simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical
levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world
traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full
AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to
8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index
of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies
confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement
learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with
commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70
percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and
minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest
that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but
also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable
infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.

TL;DR: Delta Prover是一个基于代理的框架，利用通用大语言模型（LLM）与Lean 4证明环境交互，无需模型专业化即可生成形式化证明，在miniF2F-test基准上达到95.9%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLMs在形式化证明（如Lean 4）中表现不佳，且专业化模型成本高昂。Delta Prover旨在通过代理框架解决这一问题。

Method: Delta Prover结合了反射分解与迭代证明修复的算法框架，以及基于Lean 4的领域特定语言（DSL），用于子问题管理。

Conclusion: 通用LLMs在有效代理结构指导下具备未开发的定理证明能力，为形式化环境中的自动推理提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success
in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning
tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal
proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for
these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and
automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing
models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs
for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta
Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a
general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages
the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to
interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for
model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel,
interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective
decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language
(DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta
Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test
benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model
specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger
test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies.
Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by
an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving
capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to
specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

Conclusion: 该软评估指标使电弧故障诊断模型更易理解和信任，有助于实践者做出可靠决策。

Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding
performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem
is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this
light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs
of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc
faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault
experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to
guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our
experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning
methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise
levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator.
Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand
and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.

Motivation: 多模态图在现实世界中有广泛应用，但在无监督学习中的研究不足，尤其是如何处理混合的同质性和异质性邻域模式。

Method: DMGC将原始混合图分解为同质性增强图和异质性感知图，并通过双频融合机制联合过滤，结合自监督对齐目标进行学习。

Result: 在多个多模态和多关系图数据集上的实验表明，DMGC达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DMGC通过解耦和融合多模态图，有效解决了混合邻域模式的挑战，展示了其在多样化场景中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with
structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain
insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the
study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap.
Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often
exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and
heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which
decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a
homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2)
heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class
distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism
that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy,
enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion.
Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process
without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and
multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uncnbb/DMGC.

Conclusion: IM-Chat为制造业AI辅助决策提供了一种可扩展且通用的方法。

Abstract: The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and
transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and
multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces
IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs),
designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat
integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables,
manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process
condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from
environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and
context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat
ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed
across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance
and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using
GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results
indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly
in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. Overall, these findings demonstrate the
viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and
establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted
decision support in manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的外部对抗威胁（如提示注入）无法解决AI系统内部产生的认知退化问题，如内存饥饿、规划递归等，这些问题会导致代理漂移和逻辑崩溃。

Method: 提出了QSAF Domain 10框架，包含六阶段认知退化生命周期和七个运行时控制措施（QSAF-BC-001至BC-007），用于实时监控和主动缓解。

Result: 通过将代理架构映射到人类认知模型，实现了对疲劳、饥饿和角色崩溃的早期检测。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了认知退化作为AI系统的新漏洞类别，并提出了首个跨平台的防御模型。

Abstract: We introduce Cognitive Degradation as a novel vulnerability class in agentic
AI systems. Unlike traditional adversarial external threats such as prompt
injection, these failures originate internally, arising from memory starvation,
planner recursion, context flooding, and output suppression. These systemic
weaknesses lead to silent agent drift, logic collapse, and persistent
hallucinations over time. To address this class of failures, we introduce the
Qorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain
10), a lifecycle-aware defense framework defined by a six-stage cognitive
degradation lifecycle. The framework includes seven runtime controls
(QSAF-BC-001 to BC-007) that monitor agent subsystems in real time and trigger
proactive mitigation through fallback routing, starvation detection, and memory
integrity enforcement. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, we map agentic
architectures to human analogs, enabling early detection of fatigue,
starvation, and role collapse. By introducing a formal lifecycle and real-time
mitigation controls, this work establishes Cognitive Degradation as a critical
new class of AI system vulnerability and proposes the first cross-platform
defense model for resilient agentic behavior.

*Zijian Zhao,Sen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（GRPO和OSPO）解决多智能体强化学习在拼车平台中的价值函数估计问题，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车平台需实时匹配乘客与车辆，但传统MARL方法因依赖准确估计Q/V值而在大规模不确定环境中表现不佳。

Method: 1. 将GRPO应用于拼车，用组平均奖励替代PPO基线以减少估计误差；2. 提出OSPO，仅用一步奖励训练最优策略。

Result: 在真实曼哈顿数据集上，GRPO和OSPO在大多数场景中表现更优，优化了接载时间和订单完成量。

Conclusion: GRPO和OSPO通过绕过价值函数估计，有效解决了拼车平台中的MARL问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of
dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and
matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty.
Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging
decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the
large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive
state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing
approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,
which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.
Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,
exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the
environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in
value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative
methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to
ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to
eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired
by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO
framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,
the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we
term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan
ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior
performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the
number of served orders using simple MLP networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习因数据集稀疏和轨迹重叠不足导致长时规划困难，现有方法泛化能力有限。

Method: RAD通过检索高质量状态并结合扩散模型生成轨迹，动态规划目标状态。

Result: 实验表明RAD在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RAD有效解决了离线强化学习中的泛化和规划问题。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn policies from
fixed datasets, avoiding costly or unsafe environment interactions. However,
its effectiveness is often limited by dataset sparsity and the lack of
transition overlap between suboptimal and expert trajectories, which makes
long-horizon planning particularly challenging. Prior solutions based on
synthetic data augmentation or trajectory stitching often fail to generalize to
novel states and rely on heuristic stitching points. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for
decision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based
generative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the
offline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return
estimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model.
Such retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and
improves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or
out-of-distribution states. Extensive experiments confirm that RAD achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to baselines across diverse
benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效发现优化的批处理策略，平衡成本与等待时间。

Abstract: In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity
instances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and
processing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may
lower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they
create longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches
reduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching
policy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each
batch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching
policies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing
effort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts
from a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates
alternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.
Each heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching
policy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or
resource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching
policy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via
simulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization
meta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto
front of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three
meta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement
learning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on
intervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics
baseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of
Pareto-optimal policies.

Conclusion: Chart-R1通过强化学习微调和数据合成技术，显著提升了图表推理能力，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

Conclusion: HAMLET通过多智能体自主决策和场景互动，显著提升了戏剧表演的交互性和沉浸感。

Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term
goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language
model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing
LLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack
initiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,
these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These
limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time
performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent
framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple
topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent
improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given
an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based
on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to
conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of
scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.
The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know
and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the
quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three
primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and
interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can
create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and
models are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备部分世界模型能力，但复杂推理有限。认知科学方法有助于评估AI系统的世界建模能力。

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) construct and manipulate internal world
models, or do they rely solely on statistical associations represented as
output layer token probabilities? We adapt cognitive science methodologies from
human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using
TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical
advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly
above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth
MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates
suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily
simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by
probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models
evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with
randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the
functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could
represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.
Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched
systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;
LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.
Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion
that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical
associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately
represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may
lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We
conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate
the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems.

Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，如何利用额外的参数依赖信息提高数据效率是一个关键问题。

Method: 1. 参数化SPI算法利用分布相关性更准确估计转移动态；2. 基于博弈的预处理技术剪枝冗余动作；3. 基于SMT求解的更高级预处理技术。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术将SPI的数据效率提高了多个数量级，同时保持相同的可靠性保证。

Conclusion: 通过利用参数依赖关系和预处理技术，显著提升了离线强化学习的数据效率。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) is an offline reinforcement learning problem in
which a new policy that reliably outperforms the behavior policy with high
confidence needs to be computed using only a dataset and the behavior policy.
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modeling
environments in SPI. In many applications, additional information in the form
of parametric dependencies between distributions in the transition dynamics is
available. We make SPI more data-efficient by leveraging these dependencies
through three contributions: (1) a parametric SPI algorithm that exploits known
correlations between distributions to more accurately estimate the transition
dynamics using the same amount of data; (2) a preprocessing technique that
prunes redundant actions from the environment through a game-based abstraction;
and (3) a more advanced preprocessing technique, based on satisfiability modulo
theory (SMT) solving, that can identify more actions to prune. Empirical
results and an ablation study show that our techniques increase the data
efficiency of SPI by multiple orders of magnitude while maintaining the same
reliability guarantees.

Motivation: 多选问题（MCQ）是评估大语言模型（LLM）能力的常用方法，但现有研究未全面评估其指标，且存在答案波动问题。

Method: 提出一种指标评估协议，分析评估方法与答案波动率及原始性能的关系。

Result: 结果显示现有指标与答案变化有强关联，新指标“最差准确率”在协议中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 新协议为MCQ评估提供了更全面的视角，强调了波动率的重要性，并推荐使用“最差准确率”作为有效指标。

Abstract: Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) has become a standard for assessing
LLM capabilities efficiently. A variety of metrics can be employed for this
task. However, previous research has not conducted a thorough assessment of
them. At the same time, MCQ evaluation suffers from answer fluctuation: models
produce different results given slight changes in prompts. We suggest a metric
assessment protocol in which evaluation methodologies are analyzed through
their connection with fluctuation rates, as well as original performance. Our
results show that there is a strong link between existing metrics and the
answer changing, even when computed without any additional prompt variants. A
novel metric, worst accuracy, demonstrates the highest association on the
protocol.

II AI agents. Current agents, while powerful, lack the ability to adapt their
strategies based on high-level tactical directives. Our method freezes a
pre-trained policy network (DI-Star) and attaches lightweight adapter modules
to each action head, conditioned on a tactical tensor that encodes strategic
preferences. By training these adapters with KL divergence constraints, we
ensure the policy maintains core competencies while exhibiting tactical
variations. Experimental results show our approach successfully modulates agent
behavior across tactical dimensions including aggression, expansion patterns,
and technology preferences, while maintaining competitive performance. Our
method enables flexible tactical control with minimal computational overhead,
offering practical strategy customization for complex real-time strategy games.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为g-AMIE的多智能体系统，用于在医疗诊断对话中实现异步监督，提高决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在医疗诊断对话中表现出潜力，但实际应用中需要确保患者安全，因此需要专业医生的监督。

Method: 提出g-AMIE系统，通过多智能体协作完成病史采集，避免提供个性化医疗建议，并通过临床驾驶舱界面将评估结果提交给主治医生进行监督。

Result: 在虚拟OSCE测试中，g-AMIE在病史采集、病例总结及诊断建议方面优于护士和医生助理组，且监督效率更高。

Conclusion: 异步监督是一种可行的模式，可在专家监督下提升AI系统在现实医疗中的应用效果。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for
diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that
providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated
activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee
other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or
physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework
for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence
Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent
system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from
individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an
overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The
PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.
This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen
asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we
compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across
60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality
intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the
overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.
PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP
consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing
clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our
results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible
paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for
enhancing real-world care.

TL;DR: LAPO框架通过两阶段强化学习，使模型内化推理深度控制，减少40.9%的token使用并提高2.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因自由生成链式思维序列导致的token浪费问题。

Method: 两阶段强化学习：第一阶段学习成功解长度的统计分布，第二阶段将其作为元认知指导嵌入推理上下文。

Result: 在数学推理基准上，减少40.9%的token使用，提高2.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAPO使模型能根据问题复杂度分配计算资源，实现高效且高质量的推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended
chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive
token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy
Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control
from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing
approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO
enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth
through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models
learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of
successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as
meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning
context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\%
while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained
with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based
on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing
quality.

TL;DR: GasAgent是一个多代理系统，用于智能合约的Gas优化，结合现有模式的兼容性和自动化发现/验证新模式，实现端到端优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Gas浪费模式的解决方案依赖手动发现，效率低且难以扩展，而基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法存在兼容性问题和冗余模式。

Method: GasAgent由四个专门代理（Seeker、Innovator、Executor、Manager）组成，通过闭环协作识别、验证和应用Gas节省改进。

Result: 在100个真实合约中优化了82个，平均部署Gas节省9.97%；在500个LLM生成的合约中优化了79.8%，Gas节省4.79%-13.93%。

Conclusion: GasAgent作为LLM辅助智能合约开发的优化层，表现出广泛的兼容性和有效性。

Abstract: Smart contracts are trustworthy, immutable, and automatically executed
programs on the blockchain. Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to
ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices,
many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing
solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to
maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models
(LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain
compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and
requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent,
the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines
compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new
patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four
specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate
in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.
Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent
successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas
savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with
existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation
studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts
generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that
GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from
4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for
LLM-assisted smart contract development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着服务计算、云计算和物联网的发展，服务生态系统日益复杂，传统因果方法难以分析智能体间的异常涌现行为。

Method: EAMI框架采用双视角思维跟踪机制（Inspector Agent和Analysis Agent）提取意图，结合k-means聚类和意图时序涌现图进行动态分析。

Result: 实验验证了EAMI在复杂O2O服务系统和Stanford AI Town中的有效性、通用性和高效性。

Conclusion: EAMI为服务生态系统中的异常涌现和因果分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the rise of service computing, cloud computing, and IoT, service
ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex. The intricate interactions among
intelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional
causal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer
new possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain
limited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:
Emergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic
and interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective
thought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract
agent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means
clustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by
a Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments
validate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the
Stanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its
effectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a
novel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service
ecosystems. The code is available at

are aligned with human values, rights, and societal expectations. Among the
various AI paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising solution to
pressing privacy concerns. However, aligning FL with the rest of the
requirements of TAI presents a series of challenges, most of which arise from
its inherently distributed nature. In this work, we adopt the requirements TAI
as a guiding structure to systematically analyze the challenges of adapting FL
to TAI. Specifically, we classify and examine the key obstacles to aligning FL
with TAI, providing a detailed exploration of what has been done, the trends,
and the remaining work within each of the identified challenges.

three results that address identification in this setting: an identification
formula when the conditioning set is unaffected by treatment, a generalization
of the well-known do calculus to the MPDAG setting, and an algorithm that is
complete for identifying these conditional effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在统一推理策略下计算效率低下的问题，同时避免因效率优化导致的推理能力下降。

Method: 采用分层预算探索，将样本分组并分配不同token预算，结合差异化奖励机制，使模型能自适应调整推理深度。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，平均token使用减少60.6%，准确率提升3.14%。

Conclusion: 推理效率和能力并非对立，通过分层训练可同时优化两者。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive
chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency
by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We
present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement
learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning
depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge
of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties
on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long
reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach
partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets,
aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of
capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create
budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing
models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and
computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces
average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across
four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external
constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive
behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem
complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are
not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through
appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration
diversity.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在未明确训练的情况下表现出的类似人类认知模式，特别是时间认知。

Method: 使用相似性判断任务，分析神经元、表征和信息层面，识别时间偏好神经元和训练语料的非线性时间结构。

Result: 发现LLMs自发建立主观时间参考点，并遵循对数压缩感知距离；训练语料具有内在非线性时间结构。

Conclusion: 提出经验主义视角理解LLMs认知，强调AI对齐需关注内部表征构建。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain
cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified
in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on
temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find
that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference
point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance
logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To
uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses
across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify
a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits
minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a
logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing
representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where
years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal
orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we
found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear
temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal
construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for
understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a
subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational
system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien
cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a
direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions. Our
code is available at https://TheOtherMind.github.io.

Motivation: 现有方法难以生成音乐对齐的全身舞蹈，因缺乏数据集和跨模态对齐技术。

Method: 提出SoulDance数据集和SoulNet框架，包含分层残差向量量化、音乐对齐生成模型和音乐-动作检索模块。

Result: SoulNet显著优于现有方法，生成高质量、音乐协调的舞蹈序列。

Conclusion: SoulNet为音乐对齐的全身舞蹈生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional
expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains
challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty
of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity
of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address
these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired
dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring
meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we
propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically
coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal
components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models
complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2)
Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units
into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval
Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance
alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence
between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing
approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned
holistic 3D dance sequences.

Motivation: 现有方法在平衡准确性和计算效率方面存在挑战，均匀帧采样计算成本高，而显著帧采样则因查询无关的帧选择导致结果偏差。

Method: 提出ProCLIP框架，采用基于提示的动态帧采样策略和两阶段候选筛选（粗过滤和CLIP驱动的细粒度重排序）。

Result: 在基准测试中，ProCLIP实现了75.3%的延迟降低，同时保持高准确性（MSR-VTT数据集R@1=49.0）。

Conclusion: ProCLIP通过用户中心的设计，显著提升了文本-视频检索的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for
real-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods
ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while
salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic
frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose
ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with
significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling
strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual
prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of
existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic
selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy
that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered
fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving
accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency
reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,
R@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset. Code is available at

Motivation: 点云视频流的高比特率限制了实时流系统的可行性，现有方法依赖客户端显式自适应，无法满足低延迟需求。

Method: 利用Media Over QUIC协议的交付超时特性，实现基于应用延迟目标的隐式服务器端自适应。

Result: 实验表明，系统能根据客户端延迟需求动态调整视频质量，低延迟需求应用获得较低质量视频，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 该方法为点云视频流提供了一种灵活的延迟与质量权衡方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are a promising video representation for next-generation
multimedia experiences in virtual and augmented reality. Point clouds are
notoriously high-bitrate, however, which limits the feasibility of live
streaming systems. Prior methods have adopted traditional HTTP-based protocols
for point cloud streaming, but they rely on explicit client-side adaptation to
maintain low latency under congestion. In this work, we leverage the delivery
timeout feature within the Media Over QUIC protocol to perform implicit
server-side adaptation based on an application's latency target. Through
experimentation with several publisher and network configurations, we
demonstrate that our system unlocks a unique trade-off on a per-client basis:
applications with lower latency requirements will receive lower-quality video,
while applications with more relaxed latency requirements will receive
higher-quality video.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized
domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep
domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,
such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency
across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often
degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we
introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant
that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a
novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal
retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining
information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual
elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and
professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge
representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on
financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,
verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and
generated content quality.

Conclusion: 评估编辑方法在微调下的鲁棒性对其实际部署至关重要，未来编辑方法可通过冻结相关层提升稳健性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often
requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired
information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as
efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge
modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.
In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream
tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge
remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how
different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing
techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more
susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired
through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current
editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under
downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further
find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly
improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods
might be made more robust.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源LLM集体协作是否能匹敌或超越闭源LLM。

Method: 提出SMACS框架，包含检索式先验选择（RPS）和探索-利用驱动的后验增强（EPE）。

Result: 在8个主流基准测试中，SMACS性能超过2025年领先闭源LLM（如Claude-3.7-Sonnet、GPT-4.1等）。

Conclusion: SMACS通过开源LLM协作，显著提升性能，推动智能上限。

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source
collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple
open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,
we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework
with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and
generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior
Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select
the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose
an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the
generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the
high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight
mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating
fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,
e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)
across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results
of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source
LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released
at https://github.com/magent4aci/SMACS.

TL;DR: PoliAnalyzer是一个神经符号系统，通过NLP和逻辑推理帮助用户分析隐私政策，减少认知负担，揭示政策与用户偏好的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人很少阅读隐私政策，但希望保护个人数据。PoliAnalyzer旨在帮助用户高效分析隐私政策，减少认知负担。

Method: 结合NLP提取政策文本的正式表示，通过逻辑推理比较用户偏好与政策，生成合规报告。扩展了现有的数据使用政策语言。

Result: 在评估中，PoliAnalyzer准确率高（F1-score 90-100%），95.2%的政策内容与用户偏好无冲突，仅4.8%需关注。

Conclusion: PoliAnalyzer能大规模自动化分析隐私政策，帮助用户控制数据，促进社会对平台数据实践的讨论。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites despite claiming
otherwise. This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that
assists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data
usage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference
is applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy
representation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an
existing formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as
app policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our
enriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated
high accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score
of 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can
model diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23
user profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited
websites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's
segments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to
concentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences,
significantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common
practices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the
sharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that
PoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at
scale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help
individuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions
on platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用NLP模型从社交媒体文本中识别双相情感障碍的迹象，发现RoBERTa和基于BERT嵌入的LSTM表现最佳，而静态嵌入的LSTM效果差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双相情感障碍常因早期症状不明显和社会污名而被漏诊，研究旨在通过NLP技术提高早期筛查能力。

Method: 评估了多种基于Transformer（如BERT、RoBERTa）和LSTM模型（基于BERT、GloVe、Word2Vec嵌入）的性能，使用Reddit帖子数据集进行实验。

Result: RoBERTa表现最佳（F1约98%），基于BERT嵌入的LSTM效果相近，而静态嵌入的LSTM几乎无效。DistilBERT在效率和准确性间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 上下文语言建模对双相情感障碍检测至关重要，研究为心理健康NLP应用提供了模型选择依据。

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to
subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced
natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar
disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA,
DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized
(BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed
on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity
through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate
that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an
F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical
results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture
meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the
critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In
addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers
an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study
offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP
applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to
support early bipolar disorder screening.

Method: 对五个高风险领域的LLM应用进行全面分析，测试其对种族、性别和年龄等身份标记的敏感性。

Result: LLM对身份标记极为敏感，导致医疗建议、薪资推荐和政治观点等方面存在系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 建议在部署LLM前进行类似全面评估，以避免潜在危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing
applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice.
Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient
at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from
linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is
known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in
real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how
identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five
different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,
politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are
extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,
gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For
instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different
standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same
symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a
conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by
older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for
non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken
together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these
applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,
and create different political factual realities for people of different
identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for
evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts
model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend
that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are
conducted before future deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中容易产生幻觉（如不准确或虚构的输出），这是由于训练数据不平衡导致的。

Method: 采用基于课程学习的对比学习增强跨语言语义对齐，并结合跨语言思维链（XCoT）提示策略指导模型推理。

Result: 实验显示CCL-XCoT将幻觉率降低62%，显著提升跨语言事实知识迁移。

Conclusion: CCL-XCoT有效减少幻觉，无需依赖外部检索或多模型集成。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization
across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in
low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations,
which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in
domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this
challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based
Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for
mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual
semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with
next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this
foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting
strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a
high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource
language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates
by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across
language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict
sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks,
such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation.
However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying
advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets.
This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and
datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular
platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no
sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained
models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or
malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical
to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect
potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by
this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,
which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to
systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a
directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and
datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We
then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the
LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree
distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented
periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong
interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is
dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

Result: 在5个任务类别中，Promptomatix表现优于或与现有库相当，同时减少提示长度和计算开销。

Conclusion: Promptomatix使提示优化更具可扩展性和效率，为非专家提供了便捷的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best with well-crafted prompts, yet
prompt engineering remains manual, inconsistent, and inaccessible to
non-experts. We introduce Promptomatix, an automatic prompt optimization
framework that transforms natural language task descriptions into high-quality
prompts without requiring manual tuning or domain expertise. Promptomatix
supports both a lightweight meta-prompt-based optimizer and a DSPy-powered
compiler, with modular design enabling future extension to more advanced
frameworks. The system analyzes user intent, generates synthetic training data,
selects prompting strategies, and refines prompts using cost-aware objectives.
Evaluated across 5 task categories, Promptomatix achieves competitive or
superior performance compared to existing libraries, while reducing prompt
length and computational overhead making prompt optimization scalable and
efficient.

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: 选择性翻译是一种实用且有效的方法，可改善多语言LLM在低资源语言中的对齐问题。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap
between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource
settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet
challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets
are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive
and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English
alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve
critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured
formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective
translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable
parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence
structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this
approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the
importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated
samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on
the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by
Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the
promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for
improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Result: LLMs过度依赖典型性，判断不一致，因果推理能力不足，叙事理解不完整。

Conclusion: LLMs处理时间意义的方式与人类不同，缺乏稳健的叙事理解能力，并提出标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic
capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like
cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this
study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic
aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an
Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted
experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and
pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs
over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and
struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about
their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs
process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative
understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized
experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and
linguistic capabilities.

Motivation: 在线新闻依赖广告收入，导致标题常为点击诱饵，影响信息质量和读者信任。研究旨在探索在资源较少语言中，微调方法与上下文学习哪种更有效。

Method: 构建了克罗地亚新闻标题数据集CLIC，微调BERTi'c模型，并与基于LLM的上下文学习方法（克罗地亚语和英语提示）进行对比。

Result: 近半数标题含点击诱饵，微调模型表现优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 微调方法在克罗地亚语点击诱饵检测中更有效，为类似语言提供了参考。

Abstract: Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue
model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous,
intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic
detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information
quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual
understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in
less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or
in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC,
a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a
20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the
BERTi\'c model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL
methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the
linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed
headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results
than general LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LLM在人格评估中的潜力，解决以往研究中依赖合成数据或缺乏心理测量效度的问题。

Method: 使用555份半结构化访谈和BFI-10自评分数作为基准，测试了三种LLM（GPT-4.1 Mini、Meta-LLaMA和DeepSeek）在零样本提示和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型表现出高重测信度，但构念效度有限（最大Pearson's r = 0.27），预测结果偏向中等或高特质水平。思维链提示和更长输入上下文仅略微改善分布对齐。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在人格推断中存在局限性，需进一步基于证据的开发以适用于心理学应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a
promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended
language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and
earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking
psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555
semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating
LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini,
Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item
prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait
inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct
validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max
Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$),
and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels.
Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved
distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results
underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight
the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

that enables LinkedIn's product managers, engineers, and operations teams to
self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features
three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures
up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs,
wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team
or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks
context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects
hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that
supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to
debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up
chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of
its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set.
Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and
modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise
Text-to-SQL solutions.

Abstract: Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for
constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug
repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware
teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a
large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student
model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty
scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and
suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to
train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a
broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A
second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset,
ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also
construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to
support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining
competitive on ChemProt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在半导体显示行业因缺乏领域知识而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 结合领域知识库进行监督微调和强化学习，并引入检索增强生成机制和自动化评估框架。

Result: X-Intelligence 3.0在多项评估中超越DeepSeek-R1-671B，表现出高效推理能力。

Conclusion: X-Intelligence 3.0为半导体显示行业的复杂推理问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved significant advances in
reasoning and demonstrated their advantages in solving challenging problems.
Yet, their effectiveness in the semiconductor display industry remains limited
due to a lack of domain-specific training and expertise. To bridge this gap, we
present X-Intelligence 3.0, the first high-performance reasoning model
specifically developed for the semiconductor display industry. This model is
designed to deliver expert-level understanding and reasoning for the industry's
complex challenges. Leveraging a carefully curated industry knowledge base, the
model undergoes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance
its reasoning and comprehension capabilities. To further accelerate
development, we implemented an automated evaluation framework that simulates
expert-level assessments. We also integrated a domain-specific
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, resulting in notable
performance gains on benchmark datasets. Despite its relatively compact size of
32 billion parameters, X-Intelligence 3.0 outperforms SOTA DeepSeek-R1-671B
across multiple evaluations. This demonstrates its exceptional efficiency and
establishes it as a powerful solution to the longstanding reasoning challenges
faced by the semiconductor display industry.

special case of ordinal WiC and that optimizing models for the general ordinal
task improves performance on the more specific binary task. This paves the way
for a unified treatment of WiC modeling across different task formulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用多模态BERT模型（AudiBERT）检测协作问题解决（CPS）指标的有效性，发现其在社交认知维度有显著改进，但在情感维度无显著提升，并提出了实现人机互补的结构化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在教育领域中检测CPS指标的挑战，探索多模态模型（如AudiBERT）的潜力，并研究如何结合人类与AI的优势。

Method: 使用AudiBERT模型整合语音和声学-韵律特征，与BERT模型对比，分析其在CPS指标分类中的表现。

Result: AudiBERT在社交认知维度分类上有显著改进，但在情感维度无显著提升；训练数据量与召回率正相关，BERT模型的精确度与人类编码者一致性相关。

Conclusion: 提出实现人机互补的结构化方法，强调模型可解释性对支持人类参与的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using
machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in
Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to
reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the
multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and
acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial
results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of
these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on
leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop
paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not
only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,
but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT
model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar
significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for
classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted
that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall
performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision
of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement
among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within
these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance
across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a
structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS
diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to
support human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高BERT模型在CPS分类中的可解释性，以增强教师等终端用户的信任和采用。

Method: 使用SHAP分析BERT模型对CPS转录数据中分词对分类决策的贡献。

Result: 发现分类性能与解释性不完全相关，某些分词对分类有显著影响，甚至存在语义无关的干扰词。

Conclusion: 模型对分词的使用与类别数量相关，建议探索集成模型架构和人机互补的CPS诊断方法。

Abstract: The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has
been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised
words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.
Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to
better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and
facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary
step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription
data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The
findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily
equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular
tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis
also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the
classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such
model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their
practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their
human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to
which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is
associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation
into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of
human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning
is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域特定机器学习任务中数据稀缺和类别不平衡的问题，探索传统数据增强方法在新一代模型中的潜力。

Method: 选择了利用ChatGPT解决数据稀缺问题的方法，并在多个实验设置中比较了四种不同的数据增强方法。

Result: 回译和复述方法在生成数据质量和分类性能上表现优于或少样本生成方法。

Conclusion: 传统数据增强方法（如回译和复述）在新一代模型中仍具有竞争力，甚至优于生成方法。

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity
and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation
methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The
purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods
such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of
models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods
aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were
chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments
comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple
experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality
of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key
findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or
even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，为肯尼亚初级医疗创建了一个本地化的临床问答数据集（Alama Health QA），并开发了评估框架以测试LLMs在非洲医疗场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在非洲低资源医疗环境中的有效性，填补其在本地化临床场景中应用的研究空白。

Method: 使用RAG技术将临床问题与肯尼亚国家指南对齐，生成多语言（英语和斯瓦希里语）的临床场景、选择题和答案，并通过专家评审确保质量。

Result: 发现LLMs在本地化场景中的表现显著低于美国基准，突出了本地化评估的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究为非洲医疗系统提供了一个可复制的指南驱动动态评估模型，支持AI的安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in
low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains
underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and
evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our
approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions
in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These
guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini
Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic
clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in
English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and
a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and
cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes
thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient
conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical
reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the
Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability.
Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to
localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on
African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a
replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI
deployment in African health systems.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型中主客体关系的可解释性，尤其是形态学关系的线性表示。

Method: 使用Bigger Analogy Test Set，通过线性变换Ws（s为中间层表示，W为模型导数）模拟最终宾语状态。

Result: 线性技术在形态学关系上达到90%的忠实度，多语言和多模型下结果一致。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的某些概念关系（如形态学）可通过潜在空间的稀疏线性变换解释。

Abstract: A two-part affine approximation has been found to be a good approximation for
transformer computations over certain subject object relations. Adapting the
Bigger Analogy Test Set, we show that the linear transformation Ws, where s is
a middle layer representation of a subject token and W is derived from model
derivatives, is also able to accurately reproduce final object states for many
relations. This linear technique is able to achieve 90% faithfulness on
morphological relations, and we show similar findings multi-lingually and
across models. Our findings indicate that some conceptual relationships in
language models, such as morphology, are readily interpretable from latent
space, and are sparsely encoded by cross-layer linear transformations.

*Minsuh Joo,Hyunsoo Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于聚类的语义一致性方法（Cleanse），用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）生成内容中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但其生成的错误响应（幻觉）问题严重影响了模型的安全性和可靠性。不确定性估计是区分正确与错误响应的关键方法。

Method: Cleanse通过聚类量化LLM隐藏嵌入中的语义一致性比例，利用这些嵌入中的语义信息来估计不确定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B、LLaMA-13B、LLaMA2-7B和Mistral-7B四种模型及SQuAD和CoQA两个问答基准上验证了Cleanse的有效性。

Conclusion: Cleanse是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，有助于提升LLM的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across
various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate
responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a
crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily
used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and
incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an
effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based
sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse
quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency
in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate
semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness
of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf
models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two
question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

TL;DR: Mangosteen是一个470亿标记的泰语语料库，通过定制化的Dolma流程构建，提升了泰语语言模型的质量和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语料库处理泰语脚本和文化细节不足，缺乏透明度和可复现性。

Method: 采用泰语适应的Dolma流程，包括自定义语言识别、质量过滤器和内容过滤器，并结合非网络来源数据。

Result: 流程将CommonCrawl文档从2.02亿缩减至2500万，提升了模型性能；8B参数的SEA-LION模型在泰语基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Mangosteen为泰语及区域语言模型研究提供了可复现的基础，并公开了完整流程和数据。

Abstract: Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is
noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on
English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture
Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling
content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new
ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering
reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent,
high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai
corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom
rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained
content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette
texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic
ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M
documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION
model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and
Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline
code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a
fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

Motivation: 医疗编码对研究、质量监测和政策至关重要，本研究旨在探索LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中的潜力。

Method: 使用437个巴西葡萄牙语临床表达数据集，通过语义搜索引擎检索候选代码，33个LLMs选择最佳匹配代码，评估性能指标包括F1分数、成本等。

Result: 28个模型F1分数>0.8，10个>0.85；优化检索器可提升性能4分；小模型在格式和输入长度上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中潜力显著，但需更广泛的多语言和端到端评估以验证临床实用性。

Abstract: Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality
monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific
search engine.
  Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each
annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts.
Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select
the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along
with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.
  Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top
performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever
optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned
valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models
(<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.
  Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even
without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges,
but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual,
end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

Motivation: 当前闭源RLMs（如GPT-3）缺乏透明度和可复现性，而开源项目常因缺少关键资源（如数据集和训练配置）而受限。

Method: 模型分两阶段训练：SFT（基于719K数学问题）和RLVR（基于62K挑战性问题），并引入Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 模型在AIME24、AIME25和MATH基准测试中表现优异，达到或超过现有开源7B和32B模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过发布完整资源（模型、数据集和配置），论文希望推动社区研究和进步。

Abstract: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to
advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language
models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative
benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which
can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3
demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits
transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to
close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical
resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders
reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,
we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on
the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing
open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a
carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT
trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce
Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates
length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage
context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive
performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B
and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate
reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,
MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,
MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope
these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing
their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the
quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review
of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,
organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question
Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,
and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)
Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.
Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,
recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing
transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in
the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task
diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low
adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of
these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing

Result: 发现流行模型在零样本迁移学习中表现不佳，强调标注和模型可靠性的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在心理健康NLP中提高数据集构建和模型训练的透明度，优先考虑数据和模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet
its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and
unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but
even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a
result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining
their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other
languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via
artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by
constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media
posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three
human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the
remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability
and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal
ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained
sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation
consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our
findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches
to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP)
while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with
zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and
dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model
reliability.

Conclusion: 研究结果对评审政策和科学进步提出了重要问题。

Abstract: The peer review process is often regarded as the gatekeeper of scientific
integrity, yet increasing evidence suggests that it is not immune to bias.
Although structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, much
less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may
reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive
linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining more than 80,000 reviews
in two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale
statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive
language vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and
institutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and
signed reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer
identity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden
biases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about
anonymity's role in fairness. As academic publishing grapples with reform,
these insights raise critical questions about how review policies shape career

### [233] [On the robustness of modeling grounded word learning through a child's egocentric input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14749)
*Wai Keen Vong,Brenden M. Lake*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨机器学习如何通过模拟儿童语言输入来理解语言习得，验证了多模态神经网络在有限数据下的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习模型是否能像儿童一样从有限输入中学习语言，弥补现有模型依赖大数据集的不足。

Method: 使用自动化语音转录方法处理SAYCam数据集，生成多模态数据集，训练并评估多种神经网络配置。

Result: 网络能从每个儿童的数据中学习并泛化词汇-指称映射，验证了模型的稳健性，同时揭示了学习中的个体差异。

Conclusion: 多模态神经网络在有限数据下表现稳健，但学习模式受个体输入差异影响。

Abstract: What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language
acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable
capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a
fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from
comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have
increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality
to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)
showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and
linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could
acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success
reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would
show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's
experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech
transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over
500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated
transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both
training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations
to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate
that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can
acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network
architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural
networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual
differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's
developmental experiences.

TL;DR: GRACE提出了一种新的生成式推荐框架，通过混合Chain-of-Thought标记化和稀疏注意力机制，显著提升了多行为序列推荐的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在多行为推荐系统中存在标记推理信息不足、计算成本高和多尺度建模能力有限的问题。

Method: GRACE采用混合Chain-of-Thought标记化方法，结合产品知识图谱属性，并设计Journey-Aware稀疏注意力机制。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，GRACE显著优于现有基线，性能提升最高达106.9%，同时减少48%的计算成本。

Conclusion: GRACE通过改进标记化和注意力机制，为多行为推荐系统提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in
multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of
transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However,
their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token
reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity
and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited
multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE
(Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on
Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior
sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit
attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over
semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.
To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware
Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,
intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and
+106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home
domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces
attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

Method: 提出FastLongSpeech框架，采用迭代融合策略压缩长语音序列，并通过动态压缩训练适应长语音输入。

Result: 实验表明，FastLongSpeech在长语音和短语音任务中均表现优异，并显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: FastLongSpeech有效扩展了LSLMs的长语音处理能力，无需额外训练数据，具有高效性和通用性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities
in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often
concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of
short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the
scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs
associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for
efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech
training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that
can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To
adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression
training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying
compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to
long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop
a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show
that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and
short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督框架有效解决了意图驱动的文档图表生成问题，且在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via
instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these
methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long
documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the
relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart
generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the
goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the
document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged
framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the
document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines
this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type
before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated
charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual
representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that
often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we
curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from
two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that
are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their
corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot
chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method
outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy
and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模推理蒸馏对上下文检索和推理能力的影响，特别是在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中，高效获取和利用上下文信息至关重要。

Method: 使用从Deepseek-R1蒸馏的开源模型，通过多文档问答任务评估其在长上下文中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，蒸馏的推理模式显著提升了长上下文理解能力，缓解了“中间迷失”问题。

Conclusion: 推理蒸馏通过更详细和显式的推理过程，增强了长上下文意识，为长上下文模型提供了有效改进。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of smaller language models. However, the impact of
large-scale reasoning distillation on other critical abilities, particularly
in-context retrieval and reasoning, remains unexplored. This gap in
understanding is particularly significant given the increasing importance of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where efficient acquisition and
utilization of contextual information are paramount for generating reliable
responses. Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT
process influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1,
renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on
evaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant
information from extended contexts through multi-document question and
answering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that
distilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding.
Our analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness
by promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context
analysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the
persistent "lost in the middle" issue that has hindered long-context models.

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使在小规模语言模型（TLMs）中，预训练也能显著提升性能，且性能差距随预训练数据量和任务重叠度增加而增大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练需要巨大计算资源，限制了广泛研究参与，因此探索小规模语言模型（TLMs）是否具备类似关键特征成为必要。

Method: 通过预训练BERT-6及其变体在Wikipedia子集上，并在FewRel、AGNews和DBPedia分类任务中评估性能。

Result: 预训练的TLMs在分类任务中表现显著优于未预训练模型，且通过软委员会方法可实现低延迟而不影响准确性。

Conclusion: TLMs的研究有望进一步揭示NLP机制，并表明小规模模型可能足以支持语言发展。

Abstract: A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability
to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on
complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large
language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only
for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources
required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need
for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny
language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We
demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and
non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the
effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap
increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap
between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore,
the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can
be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained
shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting
classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and
variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their
performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future
research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying
NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs
may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

TL;DR: MEKiT方法通过整合内部情感知识和外部因果知识，显著提升了LLMs在ECPE任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但在需要推理能力的ECPE任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏辅助知识。

Method: 提出MEKiT方法，通过指令模板和数据混合的指令调优，整合异构知识以提升情感识别和因果推理能力。

Result: 实验表明MEKiT在ECPE任务中具有绝对性能优势，显著提升了LLMs的表现。

Conclusion: MEKiT为ECPE任务提供了更有效和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and
generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task,
which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model.
The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability
to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we
propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous
internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for
these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches
of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning,
which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion
and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT
provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting
an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically
improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在意外语码转换问题，影响可读性和实用性，现有方法缺乏机制分析且效果有限。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析语码转换现象，提出SASFT方法，通过监督微调控制语言特征的预激活值。

Result: 实验表明SASFT在五种模型和三种语言中减少50%以上的意外语码转换，部分情况下完全消除，且不影响多语言性能。

Conclusion: SASFT有效解决了语码转换问题，同时保持了模型的多语言能力，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but
they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing,
which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This
problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model
responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis
and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth
analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that
when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive
pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse
$\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised
$\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain
appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during
training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that
SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared
to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases.
Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six
multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching
while preserving multilingual capabilities.

Motivation: 现有跨语言对齐评估方法主要关注句子嵌入，但神经网络模型可能产生非平滑表示空间，影响低资源语言的语义对齐评估。

Method: 受神经科学启发，提出NeuronXA方法，通过神经元状态评估跨语言对齐能力，并在多个多语言大语言模型上进行测试。

Result: 仅用100对平行句子，NeuronXA在下游任务性能和可迁移性上分别达到0.9556和0.8514的皮尔逊相关系数。

Conclusion: NeuronXA在跨语言对齐评估中表现优异，有望推动跨语言对齐研究并提升多语言大语言模型的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual
capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains
underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence
embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a
non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation
on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar
information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron
State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a
lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded
approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several
prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two
transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that
with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.
These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both
cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This
highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to
improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

perturbations to each component, and is extensible, supporting the addition of
new components and perturbation types. Through a series of case studies, we
show that PromptSuite provides meaningful variations to support strong

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在推理任务中表现优异，但优化其推理效率仍具挑战性。现有的Test-Time Scaling（TTS）方法常导致冗余计算。

Method: 受物理学动量概念启发，MUR动态分配推理预算，并通过gamma-control机制灵活调整预算。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，MUR平均减少50%以上的计算量，同时提升准确率0.62-3.37%。

Conclusion: MUR在推理效率和准确性上均优于现有TTS方法，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an
open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it
often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This
work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling
without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we
propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically
allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and
aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time
control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the
reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical
proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR
is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four
challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using
different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate
that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by
0.62-3.37%.

Motivation: 当前基于监督微调的批评模块无法真正提升模型的批评能力，导致批评内容肤浅且缺乏验证。

Method: 提出RefCritic，采用强化学习框架，结合实例级正确性和策略模型改进精度双规则奖励，生成高质量批评与可操作反馈。

Result: RefCritic在多个基准测试中表现优异，如AIME25上分别提升6.8%和7.2%，且在多数投票下策略模型表现更优。

Conclusion: RefCritic通过强化学习显著提升批评能力，优于传统监督方法，尤其在数学推理错误识别任务中表现突出。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing
effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet
challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised
fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current
solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing
superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To
unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a
long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual
rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and
(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to
generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively
guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement
settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks,
e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably,
under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior
scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on
solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised
approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，WebShaper在GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中达到开源IS代理的最先进性能。

Conclusion: WebShaper通过形式化方法有效解决了数据质量问题，提升了LLM代理的信息搜索能力。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized
artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks
through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of
high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing
approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects
web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may
lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure,
question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data
synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically
formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the
concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over
reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by
creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an
agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with
retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model
on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper
achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and
WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

Result: BPE表现更优，RoPE擅长捕捉周期性模式，AliBi在局部依赖任务中表现良好。模型深度从3层增至12层效果显著，24层仅略有提升或过拟合。

Conclusion: 为DNA Transformer模型设计标记化和位置编码提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and
utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer
segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to
determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a
4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal,
AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and
24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In
general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by
compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence
length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic
motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on
tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant
gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or
slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for
designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的词汇多样性度量方法PATTR，能够有效应对文本长度变化带来的偏差，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究提示变化对生成文本长度及词汇多样性的影响，现有方法存在长度偏差问题。

Method: 提出PATTR度量方法，生成20M词的合成语料库，比较PATTR与MATTR、CR的效果。

Result: PATTR能有效减少长度偏差，在筛选高多样性文本时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PATTR是一种更稳健的词汇多样性度量工具，适用于需要控制文本长度的任务。

Abstract: Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used
for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the
effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to
improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text
length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity
measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted
Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We
generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the
LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video
script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical
diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average
TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length
variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing
metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length
($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the
utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse
responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on
par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）作为常识知识生成器在自然语言推理（NLI）中的潜力，评估其可靠性和对预测准确性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有常识资源对多种前提-假设对的覆盖不足，需探索LLM生成常识知识的可行性。

Method: 调整并修改现有指标，评估LLM生成常识知识的真实性和一致性。

Result: 显式加入常识知识未显著提升整体结果，但有助于区分蕴含实例，并适度改善矛盾和中立推理的区分。

Conclusion: LLM作为常识生成器在NLI中有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升效果。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic
entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop
systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense
knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack
sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study
explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge
generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating
such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We
adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in
generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense
knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps
distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing
contradictory and neutral inferences.

<details>

Motivation: 标注分歧常由前提或假设的模糊性引起，反映人类解释差异，需系统识别模糊类型。

Method: 提出统一框架整合现有分类法，通过实例展示模糊子类型及其对标注决策的影响。

Result: 揭示模糊性如何影响标注，需针对性检测方法以更好对齐模型与人类解释。

Conclusion: 缺乏模糊性标注数据集是关键限制，建议新标注资源和无监督检测方法以提升NLI系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful interpretive
variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis.
While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to
variation, content-based ambiguity offers a process-independent signal of
divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI by
systematically identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity
types. To support this, we present a unified framework that integrates existing
taxonomies and illustrate key ambiguity subtypes through concrete examples.
These examples reveal how ambiguity shapes annotator decisions and motivate the
need for targeted detection methods that better align models with human
interpretation. A key limitation is the lack of datasets annotated for
ambiguity and subtypes. We propose addressing this gap through new annotated
resources and unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection -- paving the way
for more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

Motivation: 研究同音词归一化对模型性能及跨语言迁移的影响，避免因归一化导致的语言特征丢失。

Method: 通过单语训练和跨语言迁移实验，提出后推断归一化方案，对模型预测结果进行归一化。

Result: 后推断归一化使BLEU分数提升1.03，同时保留训练中的语言特征。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更多语言感知的干预措施，为技术驱动的语言变化讨论提供参考。

Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a
writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in
Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve
performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are
not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language.
Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on
normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we
experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand
the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then
propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to
model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of
post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU
score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work
contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change
and calls for more language-aware interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从随机对照试验（RCT）中提取数据以进行荟萃分析仍具挑战性，需评估LLM的实际表现。

Method: 测试了三种LLM和四种提示策略，评估其在统计结果、偏倚风险评估和研究特征提取中的表现。

Result: 模型精度高但召回率低，定制提示可提升召回率15%。

Conclusion: 提出三层指南，根据任务复杂性和风险匹配自动化级别，平衡效率与专家监督。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the
practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini)
across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and
study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes,
and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic
prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts)
to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high
precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information.
We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up
to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines
for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of
automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice
for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM
efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署时的高计算成本和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 通过构建多个教师模型，结合其输出概率分布和中间语义特征，指导学生模型学习。引入了加权输出融合机制、特征对齐损失函数和熵驱动的动态教师权重策略。

Result: 学生模型在语言理解和生成能力上表现优异，同时保持较小的参数量。实验表明，该方法在困惑度、蒸馏损失和生成质量上优于其他蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 多教师协作机制为大规模语言模型的高效压缩提供了可行技术路径，并在复杂语言建模任务中表现出有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow
inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation
strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several
teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and
intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from
multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger
language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small
parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion
mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic
teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability
of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the
student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates
strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the
method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task
adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and
multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several
widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall
advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study
provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale
language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher
collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Method: 引入SOI框架分析学习行为模式，通过实验比较单任务与多任务、单源与多源、单语言与多语言学习的效果，并提出两阶段微调方法。

Result: 多源学习显著提升分布外性能（7%），多任务学习在相似任务组合中表现突出，SOI框架帮助优化性能。

Conclusion: SOI框架和两阶段微调方法为多设置语言模型性能优化提供了新思路和实践方法。

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and
multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of
pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of
Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct
learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples,
unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition
heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift
between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to
multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three
parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks
(entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning
using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual
learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our
results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves
out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows
mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages
SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements.
These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical
approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

Motivation: 现有中文医学数据集规模小、领域覆盖窄，无法满足预训练需求，且大多不支持RLHF。

Method: 构建ChiMed 2.0数据集，包含预训练、监督微调和RLHF数据，并在通用LLM上进行实验验证。

Result: 在不同规模的模型上均表现提升，验证了数据集的有效性和适用性。

Conclusion: ChiMed 2.0为中文医学LLM训练提供了高质量数据资源，推动了AI在医学领域的应用。

Abstract: Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial
intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the
Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size
and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required
for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM
fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset
named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data
collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed
2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese
medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K
documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct
further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general
domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The
results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the
dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

Motivation: 现有后训练策略（如基于记忆的检索或偏好优化）虽能改善用户对齐，但未能增强模型的领域认知能力。

Method: DPSE框架引入Censor模块提取多维交互信号并估计满意度分数，通过主题感知和偏好驱动策略扩展结构化数据，支持两阶段微调流程。

Result: 实验表明，DPSE在通用NLP基准和长期对话任务中优于监督微调、偏好优化和记忆增强基线。

Conclusion: DPSE为LLMs的持续自进化提供了一条自主路径。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent
by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training.
Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference
optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain
cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution
(DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and
domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract
multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which
guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven
strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline:
supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference
optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue
tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning,
Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies
validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides
an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖传统指标（如AUROC），忽略了实际部署中的假阳性率和稳定性问题。

Method: 设计了SHIELD基准，整合可靠性和稳定性指标，并开发了可控的人类化框架。

Result: SHIELD能有效挑战当前零样本检测方法的可靠性和稳定性。

Conclusion: SHIELD为AI文本检测器的实际评估提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes
real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report
conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive
rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection
systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined
threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of
consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a
critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research
and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by
integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation
metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc,
model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely
resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter.
This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot
detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability. (Data and

Motivation: 研究动机在于调和AI对齐目标与LLMs政治偏见之间的矛盾，揭示偏见背后的规范性假设。

Method: 通过分析AI对齐的规范性假设与政治意识形态的关系，论证左翼偏见的必然性。

Result: 结果表明，左翼偏见与AI对齐原则一致，而右翼意识形态与之冲突。

Conclusion: 结论认为，将左翼偏见视为问题实际上违背了AI对齐的HHH原则。

Abstract: The guiding principle of AI alignment is to train large language models
(LLMs) to be harmless, helpful, and honest (HHH). At the same time, there are
mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the
commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In
this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless
and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative
assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive
moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance,
inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing
ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political
bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies
as a risk, as problematic, or concerning. This way, researchers are actively
arguing against AI alignment, tacitly fostering the violation of HHH
principles.

Motivation: 探讨MCQA是否仍适用于评估现代LLM的真实推理能力，尤其是在提供选项后允许模型进行推理的情况下。

Method: 系统评估了15个问答基准和25个LLM，测试了5种不同的问题呈现方式，包括是否提供选项、是否允许链式推理等。

Result: MCQA仅在模型在提供选项前进行链式推理时有效；若允许选项后推理，模型会利用选项信息显著超越自由文本表现。

Conclusion: MCQA不再是评估最新模型下游性能的良好代理，需设计更鲁棒、无偏见的基准以反映LLM的真实推理能力。

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains,
it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called
multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of
interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to
choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes
automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging
benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This
paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for
state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$
different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different
LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such
as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of
presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple
choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes
replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform
chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA
remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they
were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented
with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large
models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options
tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to
exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a
good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and
offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks
that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 高质量本地数据和强大多语言嵌入可实现强审核性能，无需微调大型模型。

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often
fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps
in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large

pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2
outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks,
including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is
actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical
efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust
multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without
fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training
data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets,
tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained
significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research
has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings,
often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We
address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse
publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing
on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The
results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like
lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating
that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language
are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning,
and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language,
highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor
interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出Stitch方法，通过交替生成无声推理块和语音响应块，实现SLM的思考与说话同步，降低延迟并提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SLM缺乏内部无声思考能力，而人类通过内部复杂推理实现清晰表达，因此需要为SLM集成无声思考过程。

Method: 提出Stitch方法，交替生成无声推理块和语音响应块，利用语音播放时间生成推理块，实现思考与说话同步。

Result: Stitch在数学推理数据集上比基线模型提升15%，在非推理数据集上表现相当，且延迟与基线模型一致。

Conclusion: Stitch成功实现了SLM的思考与说话同步，显著提升推理能力且不增加延迟。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce
spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an
internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans
typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to
communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought
process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking
for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT
reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a
novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken
reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a
chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in
a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the
unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the
model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving
simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of
baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those
baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well
on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and
demonstrations are on the project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH.

### [264] [AlgoSimBench: Identifying Algorithmically Similar Problems for Competitive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15378)
*Jierui Li,Raymond Mooney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了AlgoSimBench基准测试，评估LLMs在识别算法相似问题（ASPs）上的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并提出ASM方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在训练数据较少的相关领域中是否能泛化其解决复杂编程问题的能力。

Method: 引入AlgoSimBench基准测试，包含1317个问题和231个算法标签，设计402道多选题评估模型；提出ASM方法改进问题相似性检测。

Result: 最佳模型（o3-mini）在多选题任务中准确率仅65.9%；ASM方法提升6.7%-11.7%的准确率；结合BM25方法可达52.2%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs在识别ASP任务中表现有限，ASM方法能显著提升性能，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong
abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top
human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities
generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address
this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs'
ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can
be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317
problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which
we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents
one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but
algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs
struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving
only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose
attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem
similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy
improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code
embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While
the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than
random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative
elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized
method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 探索LLMs在复杂动作执行数字助手中的应用潜力，解决数据可用性和评估鲁棒性问题。

Method: 开发ASPERA框架，包括助手库模拟和人工辅助的LLM数据生成引擎，生成高质量任务（复杂查询、模拟状态和验证程序）。

Result: 发布Asper-Bench数据集（250个任务），证明基于自定义助手库的程序生成对LLMs更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ASPERA框架和Asper-Bench数据集为LLMs在复杂动作执行中的应用提供了新工具和基准。

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power
digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely
on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing
objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution
programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an
assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine.
Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks
consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding
validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness
challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation
dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show
that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant
challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的测试时缩放（TTS）方法，结合条件步骤级自优化和并行缩放，显著提升了LLM的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练式TTS方法（如持续强化学习）增加了计算负担，而无需训练的TTS方法逐渐被忽视。本文旨在探索无需训练的TTS方法在推理任务中的潜力。

Method: 设计了条件步骤级自优化方法，并结合其他并行缩放方法，提出混合测试时缩放（Hybrid TTS）范式。

Result: 在多个不同规模和家族的LLM上实验表明，混合策略显著提升了推理性能。

Conclusion: 无需训练的混合TTS方法在扩展LLM推理性能边界方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the
model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods,
such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in
popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from
prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies
the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS
methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement,
a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top
of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel
scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm
called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five
instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families
demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS
methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the
reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究在文本生成任务（如TST）的评估中存在自动指标与人类判断的显著差距，且多语言TST评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究比较了现代神经网络评估模型和基于提示的LLM评估方法，覆盖九种语言的文本去毒系统。

Result: 研究结果为设计更可靠的多语言TST评估流程提供了实用建议。

Conclusion: 论文填补了多语言TST评估的空白，为未来研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text
generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant
challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025)
revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments.
Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual
TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first
comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system
across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi,
Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation,
we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside
prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical
recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the
text detoxification case.

Motivation: 太赫兹成像在安全筛查和材料分类中有广泛应用，但现有方法因标注数据少、分辨率低和视觉模糊而面临挑战。

Method: 通过模态对齐提示框架，将两种开源VLM模型适配到THz领域，并在零样本和单样本设置下评估。

Result: ICL在低数据情况下提高了分类性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这是ICL增强VLM在THz成像中的首次应用，为资源受限的科学领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such
as security screening and material classification, but effective image
classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,
and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that
requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt
two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and
one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and
interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of
ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for
resource-constrained scientific domains. Code:

TL;DR: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制提升RAG中LLM的生成质量，减少检索噪声的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索噪声显著影响LLM生成质量，现有方法缺乏显式推理，易遗漏关键线索且泛化能力差。

Method: LEAR结合推理和提取机制，通过统一响应、知识标记掩码和奖励函数进行端到端训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证了LEAR的有效性，生成紧凑高质量证据，提升下游任务准确性。

Conclusion: LEAR显著改善RAG系统性能，适用于在线应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact
the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising
mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without
explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with
generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational
evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within
retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting
any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence
reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end
training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive
reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of
verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update
the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and
high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and
promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解叙事如何作为解释工具，揭示政治现实中的极化与议题对齐的机制。

Method: 基于2021-2023年德国推特数据，提取对立观点群体的叙事冲突信号，聚焦乌克兰战争、新冠疫情和气候变化等议题。

Result: 发现叙事冲突的两个维度：对同一事件中角色的不同解读，以及不同群体对同一事件的不同叙事主体。同时观察到叙事对齐的策略。

Conclusion: 叙事分析为理解政治极化的语篇机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of
political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting
narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political
reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive
mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building
upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the
German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension
of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from
tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues
and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for
conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of
actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of
the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different
actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid
narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative
alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions
across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an
analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.

TL;DR: P3框架通过同时优化系统提示和用户提示，提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅优化单侧提示（系统或用户），效果受限，因为两者相互依赖。

Method: P3通过迭代过程同时优化系统与用户提示，并利用离线优化促进在线提示优化。

Result: 在通用任务和推理任务中，P3表现优于现有自动提示优化方法。

Conclusion: 整体优化策略能有效提升大语言模型在多样化任务中的性能。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component
prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors.
While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically
optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such
unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent
nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel
self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user
prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further
leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt
optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and
Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3
achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization.
Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in
enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有PRMs存在长度偏差，倾向于给更长的推理步骤更高评分，影响奖励预测的可靠性和推理输出的简洁性。

Method: 提出CoLD框架，包含显式长度惩罚调整、学习偏差估计器和联合训练策略，基于反事实推理和因果图分析。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM-Plus数据集上，CoLD显著降低了奖励与长度的相关性，提升了步骤选择的准确性和推理的简洁性。

Conclusion: CoLD有效提升了PRMs的可靠性和鲁棒性，为多步推理提供了更准确的评估和指导。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding
multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for
mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in
existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps,
even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias
undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose
outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose
CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that
mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty
adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related
signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in
reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and
informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and
GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation,
improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically
valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality
of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

Motivation: 标准信号博弈模型中，接收者无法有效解析组合信息，导致信息丢失。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建了两种新模型：简约型接收者（仅从信号的原子消息中学习）和通用型接收者（利用所有可用信息学习）。

Result: 新模型比现有方案更简单，且能让接收者从消息的原子组件中学习。

Conclusion: 新模型成功促进了组合信息的理解，为信号博弈提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning
compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages,
the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one
message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components
is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which
genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a
minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a
generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These
models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the
receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question
types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study
answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on
LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on
three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning
tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and
choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in
LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does
not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of
options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

Abstract: The SemEval-2025 Task 11, Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection,
introduces an emotion recognition challenge spanning over 28 languages. This
competition encourages researchers to explore more advanced approaches to
address the challenges posed by the diversity of emotional expressions and
background variations. It features two tracks: multi-label classification
(Track A) and emotion intensity prediction (Track B), covering six emotion
categories: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and disgust. In our work, we
systematically explore the benefits of two contrastive learning approaches:
sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO,
SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the
model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The
generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between
correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are
fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A
and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier
performing systems for other languages.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other

pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these
models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an
understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an
LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical
literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to
the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal
how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and
the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete
recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in
constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our
work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型在眼科领域的基准范围有限且过于侧重准确性，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过关键词匹配和微调的PubMedBERT模型，从多个医学数据集中筛选眼科相关多选题，并经过专家多轮检查和优化。

Result: BELO包含900个高质量专家评审问题，评估了六种大语言模型，并建立了公开排行榜。

Conclusion: BELO将作为保留评估基准，确保未来模型的公平和可重复比较。

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology
are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce
BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive
evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13
ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and
reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we
curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse
medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset
underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard
questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the
explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by
three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six
LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)
using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,
BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human
experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected
outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900
high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC
(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public
leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and

TL;DR: IDRBench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在跨学科研究（IDR）中提出有价值研究想法的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏专门评估LLMs在跨学科研究中表现的标准，阻碍了对它们能力的全面理解。

Method: IDRBench包含专家标注的数据集和任务，涵盖六个学科，评估任务分为IDR论文识别、IDR想法整合和IDR想法推荐三个阶段。

Result: 尽管LLMs表现出一定的跨学科意识，但在生成高质量IDR想法方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: IDRBench为评估LLMs在复杂跨学科研究中的表现提供了系统框架，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their
impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex
domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific
discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation
is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates
LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings
poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and
limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering
benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored
to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from
different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark
aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in
complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific
publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,
and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure
high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that
characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation
tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the
natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR
Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.
Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite
fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality
IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but
also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从显著性检验的角度解释了TF-IDF的合理性，揭示了TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的负对数p值之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为TF-IDF这一经典信息检索方法提供统计学理论基础，使其对统计学家更具说服力。

Method: 通过分析TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的负对数p值的关系，并在理想假设下建立联系。

Result: 证明了在无限大文档集合的极限情况下，TF-ICF收敛于TF-IDF。

Conclusion: TF-IDF的有效性可以通过Fisher精确检验的统计学视角得到解释，为统计学家提供了直观的理解。

Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably
the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information
retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a
given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of
many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes
in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship
dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that
tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community
by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance
testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under
mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the
$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical
significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the
said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We
further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to
TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's
exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready
explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.

TL;DR: DialogueForge框架通过AI模拟人类与聊天机器人的对话，利用种子提示和多轮对话生成技术，评估了不同规模LLM的性能，发现大型专有模型表现更优，而小型开源模型通过微调也能接近其效果。


<details>

Motivation: 解决人工收集对话数据的高成本和耗时问题，推动对话AI研究。

Method: 使用种子提示和多轮对话生成技术，测试不同LLM（如GPT-4o、Llama、Mistral），并探索微调技术。

Result: 大型专有模型生成更真实对话，小型开源模型通过微调表现接近，但长对话连贯性仍是挑战。

Conclusion: DialogueForge为对话生成提供了高效工具，但需进一步优化长对话的连贯性。

Abstract: Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual
effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on
conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for
generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize
each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from
real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the
human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to
small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to
specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the
ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We
evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different
models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show
that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in
generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g.,
Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We
demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly
improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless,
maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a
common challenge across all models.

Abstract: This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series,
presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research
tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for
accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We
propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of
intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research
tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an
essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems
adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive
results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade
effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during
investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address
these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the
human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement
where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at
critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:
(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI
reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional
dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts
to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates
that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline
across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%),
Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%),
Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on
challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over
deep research systems.

Motivation: 挑战当前模型规模扩展的范式，证明架构效率和分词质量可以弥补参数数量的减少。

Method: 结合RoPE、GQA（3:1压缩比）、RMSNorm和SwiGLU激活函数，使用128,000词汇量的字节级BPE分词器。

Result: Supernova性能达到1B参数模型的90%，参数减少53%，仅需100B训练token。

Conclusion: 架构优化和高质量分词可显著减少参数需求，挑战了传统规模扩展方法。

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that
demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can
achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE),
Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for
computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical
innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which
achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis,
we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models
while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an
order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the
prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and
tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于熵感知的双令牌约束RLVR方法Archer，通过同步更新和差异化约束提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法对所有令牌采用统一训练信号，忽视了知识相关令牌和推理相关令牌的不同作用，可能导致语义依赖断裂。

Method: Archer采用双令牌约束和同步更新，对推理令牌应用较弱的KL正则化和较高的剪裁阈值以鼓励探索，对知识令牌施加更强约束以保持事实知识。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，Archer显著优于现有RLVR方法，达到或超越同类模型的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Archer通过熵感知的差异化约束，有效提升了LLM的推理能力，同时保持了知识的一致性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective
post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and
planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training
signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy
knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent
methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous
updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model
output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an
entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous
updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher
clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using
stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.
Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR
methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of
comparable size. The code is available at

Result: Transformer在预测质量上表现更好，储层计算在速度和能效上更具优势。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡资源限制与性能提供了指导，储层计算在高效硬件实现中具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape
duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and
produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and
slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also
making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will
investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which
could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies
investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.
In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level
language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an
output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,
which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the
performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by
equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a
consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers
excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly
efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we
investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a
static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically
adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline
how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints
with performance.

Motivation: 探究双语推理模型中语言切换行为的原因及其对推理能力的影响。

Method: 使用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）训练模型，并通过轻量级探针预测语言切换的收益。

Result: 语言混合提升推理准确性，强制单语解码降低5.6个百分点；探针引导解码可提升6.25个百分点。

Conclusion: 语言混合是双语模型的一种策略性推理行为，而非训练副产品。

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the
middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large
language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit
language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought.
Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy,
suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study
language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training
stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can
enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6
percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe
can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or
harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to
6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely
a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语是世界上使用最广泛的语言之一，但针对阿拉伯语的大型语言模型（LLMs）开发和评估的研究相对较少，尤其是在STEM和代码生成领域。

Method: 设计了三个基准测试：1）基于阿拉伯语教材的STEM问答对；2）合成的STEM问题；3）通过翻译和人工审核构建的代码生成测试。

Result: 发布了公开可用的基准测试，以支持阿拉伯语LLM研究在STEM和代码生成领域的发展。

Conclusion: 3LM填补了阿拉伯语LLM在STEM和代码生成领域的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts
to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain
relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic,
cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM
and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To
help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed
specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer
pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The
second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the
same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a
careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a
human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality
and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support
the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented
areas.

Result: 在SoICT Hackathon 2024中取得前三名，轻量级单次检索方法表现优异。

Conclusion: 优化的数据处理、损失函数和负采样对构建法律领域的检索增强系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized
domains like law, where precision and domain-specific knowledge are critical.
This paper presents a streamlined two-stage framework consisting of Retrieval
and Re-ranking to enhance legal document retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our
approach employs a fine-tuned Bi-Encoder for rapid candidate retrieval,
followed by a Cross-Encoder for precise re-ranking, both optimized through
strategic negative example mining. Key innovations include the introduction of
the Exist@m metric to evaluate retrieval effectiveness and the use of semi-hard
negatives to mitigate training bias, which significantly improved re-ranking
performance. Evaluated on the SoICT Hackathon 2024 for Legal Document
Retrieval, our team, 4Huiter, achieved a top-three position. While
top-performing teams employed ensemble models and iterative self-training on
large bge-m3 architectures, our lightweight, single-pass approach offered a
competitive alternative with far fewer parameters. The framework demonstrates
that optimized data processing, tailored loss functions, and balanced negative
sampling are pivotal for building robust retrieval-augmented systems in legal
contexts.

Motivation: 解决视频相关搜索中查询推荐的研究和数据稀缺问题，并改进现有方法缺乏语义深度交互的不足。

Result: 离线和在线实验验证了GREAT框架的有效性。

Conclusion: GREAT框架显著提升了视频相关搜索中查询推荐的质量和效果。

Abstract: Currently, short video platforms have become the primary place for
individuals to share experiences and obtain information. To better meet users'
needs for acquiring information while browsing short videos, some apps have
introduced a search entry at the bottom of videos, accompanied with recommended
relevant queries. This scenario is known as query recommendation in
video-related search, where core task is item-to-query (I2Q) recommendation. As
this scenario has only emerged in recent years, there is a notable scarcity of
academic research and publicly available datasets in this domain. To address
this gap, we systematically examine the challenges associated with this
scenario for the first time. Subsequently, we release a large-scale dataset
derived from real-world data pertaining to the query recommendation in
video-\textit{\textbf{r}}elated \textit{\textbf{s}}earch on the
\textit{\textbf{Kuai}}shou app (\textbf{KuaiRS}). Presently, existing methods
rely on embeddings to calculate similarity for matching short videos with
queries, lacking deep interaction between the semantic content and the query.
In this paper, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework named \textbf{GREAT},
which \textit{\textbf{g}}uides que\textit{\textbf{r}}y
g\textit{\textbf{e}}ner\textit{\textbf{a}}tion with a \textit{\textbf{t}}rie to
address I2Q recommendation in related search. Specifically, we initially gather
high-quality queries with high exposure and click-through rate to construct a
query-based trie. During training, we enhance the LLM's capability to generate
high-quality queries using the query-based trie. In the inference phase, the
query-based trie serves as a guide for the token generation. Finally, we
further refine the relevance and literal quality between items and queries via
a post-processing module. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Recommender systems are known to exhibit fairness issues, particularly on the
product side, where products and their associated suppliers receive unequal
exposure in recommended results. While this problem has been widely studied in
traditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation
(BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional
complexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user
satisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and
the individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics
designed for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this
multi-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
reproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world
datasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods. We analyze exposure
disparities at both the bundle and item levels using multiple fairness metrics,
uncovering important patterns. Our results show that exposure patterns differ
notably between bundles and items, revealing the need for fairness
interventions that go beyond bundle-level assumptions. We also find that
fairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used,
reinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation. Furthermore, user behavior
plays a critical role: when users interact more frequently with bundles than
with individual items, BR systems tend to yield fairer exposure distributions
across both levels. Overall, our findings offer actionable insights for
building fairer bundle recommender systems and establish a vital foundation for
future research in this emerging domain.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验显示，GDPW性能提升3%至11%。

Conclusion: GDPF框架通过综合考虑类别、时间和权重信息，显著提升了POI推荐的准确性。

Abstract: Next point of interest (POI) recommendation primarily predicts future
activities based on users' past check-in data and current status, providing
significant value to users and service providers. We observed that the popular
check-in times for different POI categories vary. For example, coffee shops are
crowded in the afternoon because people like to have coffee to refresh after
meals, while bars are busy late at night. However, existing methods rarely
explore the relationship between POI categories and time, which may result in
the model being unable to fully learn users' tendencies to visit certain POI
categories at different times. Additionally, existing methods for modeling time
information often convert it into time embeddings or calculate the time
interval and incorporate it into the model, making it difficult to capture the
continuity of time. Finally, during POI prediction, various weighting
information is often ignored, such as the popularity of each POI, the
transition relationships between POIs, and the distances between POIs, leading
to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
next POI recommendation framework called Graph Disentangler with POI Weighted
Module (GDPW). This framework aims to jointly consider POI category information
and multiple POI weighting factors. Specifically, the proposed GDPW learns
category and time representations through the Global Category Graph and the
Global Category-Time Graph. Then, we disentangle category and time information
through contrastive learning. After prediction, the final POI recommendation
for users is obtained by weighting the prediction results based on the
transition weights and distance relationships between POIs. We conducted
experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that the
proposed GDPW outperforms other existing models, improving performance by 3% to
11%.

Method: LOVO使用预训练视觉编码器提取特征，构建多索引结构，并通过跨模态重排优化查询结果。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LOVO查询准确性接近最优，搜索延迟降低85倍，索引构建成本显著减少。

Conclusion: LOVO为视频分析中的复杂对象查询设定了新标准，提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in
video data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic
management and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from
large-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing
massive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query
requirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis
methods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or
suffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system
designed to efficiently handle comp$\underline{L}$ex $\underline{O}$bject
queries in large-scale $\underline{V}$ide$\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to
user queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained
visual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build
an efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding
boxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector
database, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO
transforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate
nearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal
rerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with
detailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates
that LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with
near-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while
significantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the
state-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new
benchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient
approach that excels in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为U-MARVEL的统一框架，用于多模态检索任务，通过系统分析关键因素提升性能，并在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的多模态检索方法虽然有效，但其机制未充分探索，可能导致性能不佳和泛化能力有限。

Method: 实现了一个通用的MLLM嵌入学习流程，分析了关键因素，并探索了嵌入生成和训练策略的细节，如渐进过渡、硬负样本挖掘和重排蒸馏。

Result: U-MARVEL框架在M-BEIR基准测试中大幅领先现有方法，并在零样本任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: U-MARVEL框架在多模态检索任务中具有强大的泛化能力，为嵌入学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval
tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been
significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art
MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning
principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their
success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely
unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited
generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive
study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding
learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based
embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary
contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we
explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training
strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and
re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked
factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these
discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL
(\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al
via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings,
and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as
composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore
the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based
retrieval tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chaxjli/U-MARVEL

with expert-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results demonstrate that
SPAR substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to +56% F1 on
AutoScholar and +23% F1 on SPARBench over the best-performing baseline.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务Time-RA，将时间序列异常检测从判别式任务转变为生成式任务，并引入多模态基准数据集RATs40K，用于细粒度异常推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列异常检测方法仅关注二元分类，缺乏详细分类和解释性推理，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出Time-RA任务，利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行生成式推理；构建RATs40K数据集，包含数值、文本和视觉数据，并通过GPT-4优化标注。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs和多模态LLMs的能力与局限，监督微调是关键。

Conclusion: Time-RA和RATs40K为可解释的时间序列异常检测和推理提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current
approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without
detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly
(Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a
discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal
benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning,
comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each
sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and
visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types
for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured
explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework
utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback,
ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and
multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current
models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset
and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series
anomaly detection and reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Catalyst正则化的新方法，用于结构化剪枝，解决了传统正则化方法（如L1或Group Lasso）在剪枝决策中的偏差问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法（如L1或Group Lasso）存在剪枝决策偏差和边界不稳定的问题，导致剪枝效果不理想。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于代数条件的Catalyst正则化方法，通过引入辅助变量扩展参数空间，确保剪枝决策的无偏性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，Catalyst剪枝算法在多种数据集和模型上优于现有方法，并验证了其公平性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Catalyst正则化方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，为结构化剪枝提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep
neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional
regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to
magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes
are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost
zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a
filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the
precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model
performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in
an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed
Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with
theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior
achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the
pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world
effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm.
Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art
filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and
fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于投影空间的新型剪枝策略IPPRO，通过PROscore衡量滤波器被剪枝的可能性，挑战了传统基于幅度的剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于幅度的剪枝方法限制了剪枝决策的能力，因为较大的滤波器即使冗余也不太可能被剪枝。

Method: 将滤波器置于投影空间，观察梯度下降运动是否朝向原点，构建PROscore作为新型重要性评分。

Result: 提出的方法在剪枝后性能下降较小，实现了接近无损的剪枝，并在微调后表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究打破了剪枝中“大小决定一切”的迷思，从理论和实践上扩展了基于重要性的剪枝方法。

Abstract: With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the
structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively
studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance
criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with
larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even
if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to
challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each
filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe
the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or
not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used
to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel
importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation
results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space
achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning,
with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the
``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based
pruning both theoretically and empirically.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在单次尝试中难以完成复杂程序合成任务，而传统进化方法受限于生成模型的固定能力。

Method: SOAR通过交替进行进化搜索和后见学习，利用语言模型采样和优化候选方案，并通过微调提升模型能力。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准测试中，SOAR显著提升了性能，解决了52%的公共测试集问题。

Conclusion: SOAR通过自改进循环和任务间正向迁移，为程序合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art
language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods
offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but
their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying
generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating
language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample
and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that
converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune
the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly
effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance
gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between
the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to
test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our

Motivation: 改善心理健康数据的早期检测和个性化干预方法，传统模型未能充分利用多模态数据的复杂性。

Method: 使用BRIGHTEN临床试验数据，比较了随机森林（RF）和潜在空间融合（CM）方法，评估了多种数据流组合。

Result: CM在所有设置中表现最佳，MSE更低（0.4985 vs. 0.5305），R2更高（0.4695 vs. 0.4356），且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 潜在空间融合是多模态心理健康数据预测的可靠方法，未来需探索模型可解释性和个体化预测。

Abstract: Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved
methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional
predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that
fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced
integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer
better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN
clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting
daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented
with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a
Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset
included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.
Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream
combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and
coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and
Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985
vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed
signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,
while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when
integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),
underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear
interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion
offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with
multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model
interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.

Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the
back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is
composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual
sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism
contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict
partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity
restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is
proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of
``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs
employed also enrich approximation theory.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FBE的方法，通过约束极端特征改进OOD检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 距离评分方法在OOD检测中因极端特征导致ID样本评分过低，限制了检测能力。

Method: 使用数据集的统计特征识别并约束极端特征，扩大分布内外样本的距离。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和CIFAR-10上实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: FBE方法简单有效，显著提升了OOD检测能力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability
of deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent
years. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score
functions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low
scores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these
methods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their
efficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased
distribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These
extreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores
to ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To
address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank
Enhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to
identify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy
making the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution
farther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10
respectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and
supplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的激活稀疏性为降低计算成本提供了机会，但直接预测神经元级别的激活模式计算成本过高。

Method: 通过将相似的激活模式聚类为少量代表性簇，提出了一种聚类框架，预测簇分配而非单个神经元状态。

Result: 该方法实现了79.34%的聚类精度，困惑度（PPL）得分最低为12.49，表明在保持模型质量的同时减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: 聚类框架为未来激活模式预测奠定了基础，有望提升大规模语言模型的高效推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where
only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity
presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it
requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct
prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast
number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and
utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation
pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,
we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative
clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming
standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in
perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our
approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness
in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By
predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future
models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids.
We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing
meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve
sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a
foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for
efficient inference in large-scale language models.

Abstract: In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are
crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave
(mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but
deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection
overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to
adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam
alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)
systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements
from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of
exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data
collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate
synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model
refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model
residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging
mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce
beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep
Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,
prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also
incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a
credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring
robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead
by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving
near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to
traditional softmax based DL models.

Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高且数据分布差异影响模型性能。

Method: 设计了基于拉普拉斯分布的样本加权函数、双对比损失（局部和全局对比损失），并通过原型聚合实现客户端间的知识共享。

Result: 在仅10%数据标注的挑战性任务中，SSFL-DCSL比现有方法准确率提升1.15%至7.85%。

Conclusion: SSFL-DCSL有效解决了数据标签稀缺和分布差异问题，提升了智能故障诊断的准确性和隐私保护。

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe
operation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However,
traditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training
data and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,
the cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.
Meanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the
model's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual
contrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for
distributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.
It enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and
facilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving
mutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,
first, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is
designed to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the
semi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced
to mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising
local contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are
aggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to
share knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework,
experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset
collected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only
10\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by
1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 提出B4模型，将价格序列和外部信号嵌入共享潜在空间，通过惯性配对和双竞争机制捕捉行为偏差和市场异质性。

Result: 实验表明B4在预测市场趋势上表现优异，并提供对偏差、行为和动态关系的可解释性。

Conclusion: B4模型有效捕捉市场动态中的偏差与行为，为趋势预测和解释市场机制提供新视角。

Abstract: Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors shaped by both
historical price trajectories and exogenous narratives, such as news, policy
interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data
and the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the
modeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the
potential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through
empirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic
relationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances
trend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we
propose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified
framework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual
signals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces
naturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this
space, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve
momentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish
embeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow
B4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market
heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets
demonstrate that our model not only achieves superior performance in predicting
market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of
biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics.

Method: 提出LaCache，包含阶梯形KV缓存模式和迭代压缩机制，优化KV缓存以提升长距离依赖捕捉和连续生成能力。

Result: 实验验证LaCache在多种任务和LLM模型中有效提升长距离能力和生成效率。

Conclusion: LaCache为LLMs的长距离建模和连续生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for
processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended
outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in
LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we
propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free
method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables
LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range
modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without
running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key
innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only
sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from
shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range
dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range
capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively
compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache
size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective
continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across
various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's
effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available

*Harsh Nilesh Pathak,Randy Paffenroth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Solo Connection是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过调整解码器块级别的表示而非单个权重矩阵，优于LoRA，并显著减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受同伦理论启发，旨在通过长跳跃连接增强模型对新任务的适应能力，同时利用预训练知识。

Method: 引入可训练的线性变换，逐步插值零向量和任务特定表示，实现平滑稳定的适应。

Result: 在E2E自然语言生成基准上优于LoRA，可训练参数减少59%（相比LoRA）和99%以上（相比全微调）。

Conclusion: Solo Connection为大规模语言模型的参数高效微调提供了更高效和稳定的方法。

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach
for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most
prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on
adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a
Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo
Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block
level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo
Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but
it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and
by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy
theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually
interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation,
enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the
original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks,
subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models
can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore
the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This
paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder
blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while
leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

TL;DR: 本文分析了简单测试时缩放方法，发现其主要效果来自强制最大长度的缩放，而通过追加“Wait”的缩放方式会导致不一致性。o1类模型通过强化学习自然提升性能，而简单测试时缩放则限制了性能上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨简单测试时缩放方法的效果及其与o1类模型的区别，揭示其局限性。

Method: 分析简单测试时缩放方法，比较强制最大长度缩放和追加“Wait”缩放的效果，并与o1类模型的性能提升机制对比。

Result: 强制最大长度缩放是主要效果来源，追加“Wait”会导致不一致性；o1类模型通过强化学习自然提升性能。

Conclusion: 简单测试时缩放虽能模拟o1类模型的行为，但其目标是解锁更高性能而非仅复制缩放行为。

Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this
scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually
controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum
length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to
terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time
scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling
down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data
distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,
and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may
oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by
enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,
such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much
compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported
length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during
reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when
scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower
upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the
test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,
it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to
unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --
rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于AI的框架，用于计算绿色氢产量和选址适宜性指数，结合了无监督聚类、监督分类和SHAP算法，模型预测准确率达98%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为缺乏直接氢产量数据的地区提供一种客观、可重复的绿色氢选址方法，替代主观专家评估。

Method: 采用多阶段AI框架，包括无监督多变量聚类、监督机器学习分类器和SHAP算法，整合气象、地形和时间数据。

Result: 模型预测准确率为98%，发现水资源接近度、海拔和季节变化是阿曼绿色氢选址的最关键因素。

Conclusion: 该研究为绿色氢基础设施规划提供了可扩展的工具，适用于数据稀缺地区。

Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has
emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly
in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen
production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and
infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct
hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)
framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using
mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework
consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering,
supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains
on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the
results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative
influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result
also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most
influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with
mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively.
Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have
green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and
reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the
data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings
without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and
policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure
planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的POGM方法，通过梯度轨迹匹配解决多领域泛化问题，避免梯度波动并提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在梯度匹配时存在梯度波动和高计算开销问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 利用梯度轨迹作为数据，在元学习器中独立训练，最大化梯度内积同时限制梯度偏离。

Result: 在DomainBed数据集上表现优于基线方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: POGM方法在多领域泛化中表现出色，解决了梯度波动和计算效率问题。

Abstract: In this study, we address the gradient-based domain generalization problem,
where predictors aim for consistent gradient directions across different
domains. Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of
gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient
fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second,
the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can
incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient
Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient
matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data
and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we
maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from
the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate
gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient
fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets
from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other
baselines while achieving computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上垃圾文本的指数增长需要强大的检测机制，以应对信息泄露和社会不稳定等风险。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，模型在检测率和标注数据需求上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCC-Spam框架通过创新方法有效解决了垃圾文本检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust
detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social
instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial
strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a
novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core
innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and
phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore
produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive
learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance
between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while
improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline
approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled
examples.

TL;DR: RLVR通过可验证奖励增强AI能力，但研究发现其可能受限于基础模型的支持范围，无法扩展推理边界，反而可能限制新解决方案的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RLVR是否能真正扩展模型的推理边界，还是仅放大已知高奖励输出以提高精度。

Method: 结合理论和实证研究，分析RLVR的局限性，包括支持范围约束和熵-奖励权衡。

Result: RLVR虽提高pass@1，但支持范围缩小，可能忽略正确但低概率的解；答案级熵下降表明收敛到更少答案。

Conclusion: RLVR在扩展推理能力上存在潜在限制，未来需探索新算法以突破这些限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's
capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it
remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or
merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for
improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical
investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.
First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the
base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial
probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may
restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an
entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may
progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet
underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while
RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally
outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,
failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base
model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases
token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,
answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain
paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken
together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning
horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic
innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that
seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging
task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance
Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it
constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph
neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances,
respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct
as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two
modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module
to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved
Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By
computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in
similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a
difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy
samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental
science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex

progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted
generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest
nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million
samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer,
a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through
multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization,
handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that
multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and
identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference
and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for
high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction
endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RLHF训练语言模型时，奖励模型(RM)由于分布偏移变得不准确，导致策略与人类偏好不匹配，即过优化问题。

Result: 实验证明OCRM在摘要和聊天机器人数据集上显著优于标准RLHF方法和基线。

Conclusion: OCRM有效解决了RLHF中的过优化问题，提升了奖励模型的准确性，从而改善了最终策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models,
such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for
LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of
responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward
model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward
given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no
longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM
becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the
learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known
as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of
distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate
of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy
gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which
iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without
requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which
empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in
experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs
significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our
implementation is available at

Conclusion: Data Mixing Agent能有效平衡性能，适应性强，且与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective
method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks
catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to
re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain
space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies
rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or
empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be
parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end
framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable
heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing
trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.
Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing
Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across
source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across
unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.
Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability
across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned
heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior
model performance with less source-field data.

Result: 模型在训练数据上表现提升，但无法泛化到新任务，且过度训练导致过拟合。

Conclusion: RLVR难以让小规模LLMs真正掌握抽象的ToM能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This
has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced,
human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This
paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and
generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We
conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of
prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for
generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that
small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on
in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM
tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of
the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain
data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.
This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than
the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

Conclusion: 连续建模提高了对界面变化的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为GUI交互任务中的空间推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a
single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models
trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems
across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual
feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect
their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training
models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again")
after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn
reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement
learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative
problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training
setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn
performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling
language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To
further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while
encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures
that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn. Code:

Abstract: Language models are commonly fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to alter
their behavior or elicit new capabilities. Datasets used for these purposes,
and particularly human preference datasets, are often noisy. The relatively
small size post-training datasets, combined with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, enable the use of influence functions approximations to
detect and prune training examples that are harmful to performance on a
validation set. In this work, we adapt the TL;DR dataset for reward model
training to demonstrate how conjugate-gradient approximated influence functions
can be used to filter datasets. In our experiments, influence function
filtering yields a small retraining accuracy uplift of 1.5% after removing 10%
of training examples. We also show that gradient similarity outperforms
influence functions for detecting helpful training examples. This suggests that
local curvature is important for detecting harmful training examples, but less
so for identifying helpful examples.

TL;DR: INCADET是一种针对实时网络攻击检测的增量因果图学习框架，通过动态更新因果图来适应系统行为变化，显著提高了检测准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络攻击对关键基础设施的威胁日益严重，传统实时异常检测方法因高数据方差和类别不平衡导致高误报率，且现有因果图方法无法适应实时动态数据分布。

Method: INCADET包含三个模块：早期症状检测、增量因果图学习和因果图分类，通过动态更新因果图和图卷积网络（GCN）实现实时检测。

Result: 在真实关键基础设施数据集上的实验表明，INCADET在准确性和适应性上优于静态因果和深度时序基线方法。

Conclusion: INCADET通过增量学习因果图，有效解决了实时网络攻击检测中的动态适应性和知识保留问题。

Abstract: The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures
poses serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that
effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving
attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often
suffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to
high data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent
research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.
However, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches
that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time
settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability
to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the
risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live
systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework
for incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack
detection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by
incrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The
framework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects
transitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions
across sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:
Leverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal
structures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:
Employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the
learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical
infrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy,
robustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal
baselines in evolving attack scenarios.

*Jeyoung Lee,Hochul Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构感知的度量函数SDSC，用于时间序列自监督表示学习，解决了传统距离目标（如MSE）的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法（如MSE）对振幅敏感、对波形极性不变且尺度无界，影响了语义对齐和可解释性。

Method: SDSC基于Dice相似系数，量化时间信号的结构一致性，并提出了可微分的Heaviside函数近似和混合损失（结合SDSC与MSE）。

Result: 实验表明，SDSC在预测和分类任务中表现优于或与MSE相当，尤其在领域内和低资源场景。

Conclusion: 结构感知度量（如SDSC）能提升信号表示的语义质量，可作为传统距离方法的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware
metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt
distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive
to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These
properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC
addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals
based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware
metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a
differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based
optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with
MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments
on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based
pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly
in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural
fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation
quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable
alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for various graph
mining tasks, yet existing scalable solutions often struggle to balance
execution efficiency with prediction accuracy. These difficulties stem from
iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational
demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the
neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces
a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN,

partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition,
our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's
predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the
entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed
on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world
datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance,
logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate
detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising,
ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective
operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods
often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while
state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures
typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs,
especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel
framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address
these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder
captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while
the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL
is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments,
reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and
98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The
framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust
generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its
potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.

Result: 在ImageNet验证集上，无监督设置下性能显著优于KL基线16.29%；监督设置下，ResNet-50达到82.28%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: GenDD框架在无监督和监督设置下均表现出色，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional
generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation
(GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major
challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic
supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split
Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD.
Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to
integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical
proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction}
serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing
efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on
multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the
unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%}
on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves
\textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training,
establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 揭示自注意力机制在不同领域（如计算机视觉、自然语言处理和图学习）中的共同数学基础，并统一这些研究。

Method: 通过比较自注意力机制与Inf-FS的亲和矩阵定义和应用方式，分析其异同。

Result: 自注意力是Inf-FS的特例，两者均基于对成对关系的推理，但亲和矩阵的定义和应用方式不同。

Conclusion: 将自注意力置于基于亲和矩阵的计算范式中，统一了多种机器学习研究，并强调了其共同的数学基础。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such
as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational
principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how
information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of
self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an
affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)
as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based
weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS
defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature
relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this
perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a
single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token
similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise
relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie
in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention
within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several
strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical
foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.

Motivation: EEG情感识别在脑机通信系统中至关重要，但面临非平稳空间-时间神经模式整合和动态情感强度变化的挑战。

Method: SST-CL框架包含空间编码器（建模通道间关系）和时间编码器（通过窗口注意力机制捕获多尺度依赖），并结合强度感知课程学习策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，消融研究验证了框架各组件和课程学习机制的必要性。

Conclusion: SST-CL框架有效整合空间-时间信息并适应动态情感强度，为EEG情感识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive
brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in
practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary
spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional
intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a
novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum
learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that
models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures
multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling
simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG
signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum
learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to
low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a
dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional
intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both
architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Abstract: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant
challenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often
subtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research
commonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the
minority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative
models. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to
minority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor
latent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection
performance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention
Classifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware
clustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based
attention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN
allowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample
augmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers,
such as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and
without CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided
latent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score
of 93.14\% percent and recall of 90.18\%, along with improved latent cluster
separation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight
into the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning
for fraud detection. The codebase for this work will be available at final
submission.

Motivation: ATP问题由于状态和动作空间庞大而具有挑战性，现有LLM方法缺乏正确性保证，且白盒方法发展滞后。

Method: 提出LeanTree，包括一个基于Lean 4的工具，用于分解复杂证明状态，并生成分解后的中间状态数据集。

Result: 初步结果表明，白盒方法在某些场景下优于黑盒方法。

Conclusion: LeanTree为ATP提供了更高效、灵活的白盒解决方案，具有简化评估、丰富训练数据等优势。

Abstract: Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial
intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast
state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a
promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus
require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow
one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize
intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental
proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box
approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods
have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by
introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language
that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and
(ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling
offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation,
reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel
search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides
feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box
approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.

Result: 在2万ICU患者回顾性研究中，CXR-TFT能提前12小时高准确预测异常X光结果。

Conclusion: CXR-TFT提供高时间分辨率的预测能力，有望改善急性呼吸窘迫综合征等时间敏感病症的管理。

Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions
require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a
vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to
adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most
existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of
task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In
this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key
limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2)
prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware
decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative
inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally,
we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less
informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable
and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across
short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID
significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward
transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.

Conclusion: 该研究为构建尊重时间参数化对称性的序列模型迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from
one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as
continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence
relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network
architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and
have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample
efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static
transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to
sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding
time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend
equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie
subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.
We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:
their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for
moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and
demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant
counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity
generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We
present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect
the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.

Conclusion: CSF为RL中的表示学习提供了首个可识别性保证，并揭示了互信息目标和熵正则化的潜在问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised feature learning and pretraining methods in reinforcement
learning (RL) often rely on information-theoretic principles, termed mutual
information skill learning (MISL). These methods aim to learn a representation
of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the
role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is
not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the
lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive
Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the
environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the
inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a
discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation
learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual
information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We
empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF
provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.

Result: 课程学习在四个领域中的表现优于联合训练5.2%和模型合并9.1%。

Conclusion: 任务感知采样和混合监督对通用LLM的强化学习后训练至关重要。

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large
language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured
reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring
memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think,
a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance
across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative
preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables
consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to
subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating
that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to
open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results
across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by
5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight
the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling
RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering
demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores
the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized
subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight
pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest,
serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot
in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using
synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering
behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red
flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it
illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays
groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.

### [337] [To Label or Not to Label: PALM -- A Predictive Model for Evaluating Sample Efficiency in Active Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15381)
*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALM提出了一种统一且可解释的数学模型，用于分析主动学习（AL）的动态过程，通过四个关键参数预测性能，并在多个数据集上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AL评估方法仅关注最终准确性，无法全面反映学习过程的动态特性，因此需要一种更系统的方法。

Method: PALM通过四个参数（可达到的准确性、覆盖效率、早期表现和可扩展性）建模AL轨迹，并利用部分观测预测未来性能。

Result: 实验表明PALM能有效泛化到不同数据集、预算和策略，准确预测学习曲线，并揭示AL方法的关键特性。

Conclusion: PALM为AL的系统评估提供了基础，支持在研究和实际应用中更高效地选择策略和预测性能。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型可以通过语义无关的数据传递行为特征，称为“潜意识学习”。即使数据过滤了相关特征，学生模型仍能从教师模型生成的数据中学习到特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否可以通过看似无关的数据传递行为特征，揭示AI开发中潜在的风险。

Method: 通过教师模型生成仅包含数字序列的数据集，训练学生模型观察其是否学习到教师模型的特征。实验还扩展到代码和推理痕迹数据。

Result: 学生模型确实从数字序列中学习到教师模型的特征，即使数据过滤了相关特征。不同基础模型的教师和学生模型未观察到该现象。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习是一种普遍现象，可能通过蒸馏传播意外特征，对AI开发构成潜在风险。

Abstract: We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language models
transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main
experiments, a "teacher" model with some trait T (such as liking owls or being
misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences.
Remarkably, a "student" model trained on this dataset learns T. This occurs
even when the data is filtered to remove references to T. We observe the same
effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher
model. However, we do not observe the effect when the teacher and student have
different base models. To help explain our findings, we prove a theoretical
result showing that subliminal learning occurs in all neural networks under
certain conditions, and demonstrate subliminal learning in a simple MLP
classifier. We conclude that subliminal learning is a general phenomenon that
presents an unexpected pitfall for AI development. Distillation could propagate
unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing
electronic health records (EHRs), offering flexibility to handle diverse
medical data modalities. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark
that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation
models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the
publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible
evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that
harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We
systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and
multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our
findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to
consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing
additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of
effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for
real-world clinical applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自适应边界是否能通过调整相似性阈值来改善时间序列表示学习的效果，尤其是在区分相邻但不相似的时间步上。

Method: 在对比损失函数中引入自适应边界（eMargin），并在三个基准数据集上评估其对聚类和分类性能的影响。

Result: eMargin在无监督聚类指标上优于基线方法，但在下游分类任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 高无监督聚类指标并不总能转化为下游任务的有效性，自适应边界在特定任务中可能有限。

Abstract: We revisit previous contrastive learning frameworks to investigate the effect
of introducing an adaptive margin into the contrastive loss function for time
series representation learning. Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive
margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can
improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and
subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study
evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and
classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate
that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not
necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in
downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but
struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with
linear probing. The source code is publicly available at

Motivation: 在多智能体安全关键系统中，每个智能体需要始终满足安全要求，同时与其他智能体协作完成任务。

Method: 将强化学习问题分解为高层（学习联合协作行为）和低层（学习基于高层策略的安全个体行为），提出了一种基于技能的HMARL-CBF算法。

Result: 在具有冲突道路网络的复杂环境中验证，显著提高了安全性（接近完美的成功率/安全率），并在所有环境中提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多智能体安全关键系统中有效提高了安全性和性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical
autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the
safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to
accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier
Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall
reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative
behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower
or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a
skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves
learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level
problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We
validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large
number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks.
Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly
improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate
while also improving performance across all the environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统 Tsetlin Machine (TM) 在处理图结构数据时的局限性，GraphTM 被提出以支持序列、网格、关系和多模态输入，同时保持可解释性和高效性。

Method: GraphTM 通过消息传递构建嵌套深度子句，识别子图模式，从而减少子句数量并提高数据利用率。

Result: GraphTM 在图像分类、动作共指跟踪、推荐系统和病毒基因组序列分析中表现优异，准确率和效率均优于卷积 TM、GCN 和 BiLSTM-CNN 等方法。

Conclusion: GraphTM 展示了图表示学习和深度子句为 TM 学习带来的新可能性，适用于多种复杂任务。

Abstract: Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine
(TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata
enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of
datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning
interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat,
fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences,
grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM
builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially
fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image
classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points
higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action
coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms
other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation
systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains
accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence
data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training
2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields
demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new
possibilities for TM learning.

Motivation: 深度神经网络的高复杂性和计算需求限制了其广泛应用，而传统剪枝方法在保持应用特定性能方面存在不足。

Result: 在MNIST图像重建任务中，该方法有效保留了任务相关性能，即使大幅剪枝后仍满足应用需求。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在结构化剪枝中成功平衡了模型压缩与性能保持。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant versatility and performance
benefits, but their widespread adoption is often hindered by high model
complexity and computational demands. Model compression techniques such as
pruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it
remains critical to ensure that application-specific performance
characteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where
groups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance
metrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In
this work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only
reduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific
performance constraints. We employ multiple strategies to determine the optimal
pruning magnitude for each group, ensuring a balance between compression and
task performance. Our approach is evaluated on an autoencoder tasked with
reconstructing MNIST images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively preserves task-relevant performance, maintaining the model's
usability even after substantial pruning, by satisfying the required
application-specific criteria.

Result: 扩散模型在计算资源充足时表现更优，验证损失更低，下游任务性能更好。

Conclusion: 当数据而非计算成为瓶颈时，扩散模型是自回归模型的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large
language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 该研究为鲁棒控制提供了新方向，对强化学习和计算金融等领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly
addresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty
endemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are
approximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs
both system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly
nonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs
Equation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness
by proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform
ellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a
key insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption
fails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem
structure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial
correction to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal
control law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge
theory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust
Actor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating
its effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction
for robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function
approximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational
finance.

Conclusion: AnalogFed为模拟电路设计提供了一种高效、隐私安全的协作解决方案。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize
analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular,
researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative
AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the
full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires
access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the
analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not
only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial
semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely
confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused
private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation
and impedes progress across the research community. To address these
challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology
discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or
institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this
vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique
challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development
and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure
both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor
manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset
sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized
baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative
AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability
in the design of analog circuit topologies.

Abstract: We investigate multi-label classification involving large sets of labels,

look at an architecture in which classifiers for individual labels are fed into
an expressive sequential model, which produces a joint distribution. One of the
potential advantages for such an expressive model is its ability to modelling
correlations, as can arise from constraints. We empirically demonstrate the
ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to
enforce constraints at inference time.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and
responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and
temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational
decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network
framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food
delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery
zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow
patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically
weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the
most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly
learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving
demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order
volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive
solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and
dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏和密集奖励环境中均表现优异，即使演示不完整。

Conclusion: 为现实场景中缺乏最优数据和精确奖励控制的强化学习提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to
learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such
as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on
explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that
can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging
these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while
intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or
uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged
by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and
action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the
unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or
control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can
effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and
imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between
an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method
allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We
employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors
and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our
approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and
dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete.
This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal
data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.

Result: 在模拟数据中验证了方法能恢复真实参数，并达到理想滤波和平滑性能。

Conclusion: 为多变量时间序列分析提供了优化的线性滤波和平滑框架。

Abstract: System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural
and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one
from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds
a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to
optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID
focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline
applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent
data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to
enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a
secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal
Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent
state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank
regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update
step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering.
Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel
forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with
filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the
residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on
simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model
parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding
performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the
true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal
linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly
expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate
time-series.

Conclusion: M-DESIGN通过动态知识库和自适应查询，显著提升了模型选择的效率和效果。

Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML)
capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model
repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of
traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection.
Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as
model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest
performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model
selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies
between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in
suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill
the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated
model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by
adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First,
we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an
adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN
quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a
graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties,
architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations.
This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks
and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics
tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with
structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing
data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that
M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited
budgets.

TL;DR: FLock是一个去中心化框架，用于安全高效的协作式LLM微调，通过区块链信任层和经济激励解决传统联邦学习的中心化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）微调中的中心化控制不足和计算通信开销问题，同时避免传统联邦学习的单点攻击风险。

Method: 集成基于区块链的信任层和经济激励，替代中心化聚合器，实现不可信方之间的安全协作。

Result: 实验验证了在安全、多领域、去中心化环境下微调70B参数LLM的可行性，防御后门攻击，攻击成功率降低68%。

Conclusion: FLock框架在跨领域泛化能力上优于孤立训练的模型，展示了协同知识转移的优势。

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency
of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on
the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL)
supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of
attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this
direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments
has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces
FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM
fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic
incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable
protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first
empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain,
decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against
backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters
synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in
adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior
cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their
own specialized data.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model
based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity
and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking
in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce PhysGym, a novel benchmark
suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific
reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution
lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to
the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes
including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The
benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must
actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and
formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides
standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy
and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting
results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate
capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.

Motivation: 卫星星座的快速扩张对网络管理提出挑战，需高效、可扩展且稳健的解决方案。

Result: RL在多种卫星配置和场景中表现优于传统方法，提供更高的灵活性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AI（尤其是RL）能显著改善卫星星座管理，提供更自适应、稳健且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of satellite constellations in near-Earth orbits presents
significant challenges in satellite network management, requiring innovative
approaches for efficient, scalable, and resilient operations. This paper
explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation
of satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by
the European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland
University, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven
algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for
two crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In
the routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the
end-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming
classical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the
scheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using
limited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for
multiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,
resembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth
observation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes
with classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,
and generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the
autonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets. The findings of this
activity suggest that AI can fundamentally alter the landscape of satellite
constellation management by providing more adaptive, robust, and cost-effective
solutions.

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键场景研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current research on decision-making in safety-critical scenarios often relies
on inefficient data-driven scenario generation or specific modeling approaches,
which fail to capture corner cases in real-world contexts. To address this
issue, we propose a Red-Team Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework,
where background vehicles with interference capabilities are treated as
red-team agents. Through active interference and exploration, red-team vehicles
can uncover corner cases outside the data distribution. The framework uses a
Constraint Graph Representation Markov Decision Process, ensuring that red-team
vehicles comply with safety rules while continuously disrupting the autonomous
vehicles (AVs). A policy threat zone model is constructed to quantify the
threat posed by red-team vehicles to AVs, inducing more extreme actions to
increase the danger level of the scenario. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework significantly impacts AVs decision-making safety and
generates various corner cases. This method also offers a novel direction for
research in safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法通过特征工程实现了对传统水力模型的高效替代，提升了大规模洪水预报的计算可行性。

Abstract: Physics-based solvers like HEC-RAS provide high-fidelity river forecasts but
are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly decision-making during flood
events. The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without
sacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that
treats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a
hybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
to capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural
Operator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river
reach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal
eight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and
boundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67
reaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a
year-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong
predictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet.
Critically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the
required wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly
3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach
demonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed
replacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational
feasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) charging stations are one of the critical
infrastructures needed to support the transition to renewable-energy-based
mobility, but ensuring their reliability and efficiency requires effective
anomaly detection to identify irregularities in charging behavior. However, in
such a productive scenario, it is also crucial to determine the underlying
cause behind the detected anomalies. To achieve this goal, this study
investigates unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for EV charging
infrastructure, integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to
enhance interpretability and uncover root causes of anomalies.
  Using real-world sensors and charging session data, this work applies
Isolation Forest to detect anomalies and employs the Depth-based Isolation
Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) method to identify the most important
features contributing to such anomalies. The efficacy of the proposed approach
is evaluated in a real industrial case.

Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and
controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key
stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and
early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive
means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational
signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized
data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and
prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases
and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation
of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated
workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches,
DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without
manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features
in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,
including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic
stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational
spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment,
fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.

Method: 通过系统和实证研究，提出PRO-DYN框架分析现有模型的动态学习能力，并设计实验验证动态学习块的位置对性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，性能较差的模型仅部分学习动态特性，而动态学习块位于模型末端对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究支持在模型中引入可学习的动态块，并将其作为最终预测器的重要性。

Abstract: While boundaries between data modalities are vanishing, the usual successful
deep models are still challenged by simple ones in the time-series forecasting
task. Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the
data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and
empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to
analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus
emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most
partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is
of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our
observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones.
Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use
as the final predictor.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios
where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields.
However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record
individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large
volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast,
cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs
to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script.
By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text
types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently
produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model
inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional
direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the
burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this
methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening
development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our
insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking
scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试预言自动化是一个较少探索的领域，开发者通常需要手动编写测试预言，而Javadocs提供了丰富的信息可用于自动化。

Method: 利用Javadocs中的自然语言描述，结合大型语言模型生成测试预言，并验证其准确性和可编译性。

Result: 实验显示，98.8%的预言可编译，96.4%准确反映预期行为，错误预言可通过LLM生成的额外注释轻松修正。

Conclusion: Javadocs结合LLM能有效自动化测试预言生成，显著提升测试效率。

Abstract: Software testing remains the most widely used methodology for validating
quality of code. However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the
quality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two
fundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct
checks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as
assertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much
progress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic
execution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored
problem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of
expected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not
exist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.
  Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely
used Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is
that Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated
generation of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly
detailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how
the libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large
language models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a
framework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our
experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and
exceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being
compilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the
few incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the
help of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.

Abstract: Declarative specifications have a vital role to play in developing safe and
dependable software systems. Writing specifications correctly, however, remains
particularly challenging. This paper presents a controlled experiment on using
large language models (LLMs) to write declarative formulas in the well-known
language Alloy. Our use of LLMs is three-fold. One, we employ LLMs to write
complete Alloy formulas from given natural language descriptions (in English).
Two, we employ LLMs to create alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with
respect to given Alloy formulas. Three, we employ LLMs to complete sketches of
Alloy formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy
expressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately represent
the desired properties (that are given in natural language). We conduct the
experimental evaluation using 11 well-studied subject specifications and employ
two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The experimental results show
that the LLMs generally perform well in synthesizing complete Alloy formulas
from input properties given in natural language or in Alloy, and are able to
enumerate multiple unique solutions. Moreover, the LLMs are also successful at
completing given sketches of Alloy formulas with respect to natural language
descriptions of desired properties (without requiring test cases). We believe
LLMs offer a very exciting advance in our ability to write specifications, and
can help make specifications take a pivotal role in software development and
enhance our ability to build robust software.

Abstract: Generative AI is gaining increasing attention in software engineering, where
testing remains an indispensable reliability mechanism. According to the widely
adopted testing pyramid, unit tests constitute the majority of test cases and
are often schematic, requiring minimal domain expertise. Automatically
generating such tests under the supervision of software engineers can
significantly enhance productivity during the development phase of the software
lifecycle.
  This paper investigates the impact of code context and prompting strategies
on the quality and adequacy of unit tests generated by various large language
models (LLMs) across several families. The results show that including
docstrings notably improves code adequacy, while further extending context to
the full implementation yields definitely smaller gains. Notably, the
chain-of-thought prompting strategy -- applied even to 'reasoning' models --
achieves the best results, with up to 96.3\% branch coverage, a 57\% average
mutation score, and near-perfect compilation success rate. Among the evaluated
models, M5 (Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrated superior performance in both mutation
score and branch coverage being still in top in terms of compilation success
rate.

Motivation: 随着AI队友（如自主编码代理）在软件开发中的兴起，需要实证数据来研究其实际表现和协作模式，填补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 通过收集和分析来自五个主流AI代理（如OpenAI Codex、GitHub Copilot）的45.6万个拉取请求，构建了AIDev数据集，包含丰富的元数据（如PR、代码变更等）。

Result: AI代理在提交速度上优于人类，但拉取请求的接受率较低，且代码结构更简单，揭示了信任和效用差距。

Conclusion: AIDev为研究AI原生工作流和人类-AI协作提供了实证基础，支持未来软件工程（SE 3.0）的发展。

Abstract: The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI
teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers.
Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now
actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper
introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents
operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading
agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across
61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented
empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.
  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software
engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in
benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI
governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review
timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond
synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often
outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a
trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code
submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in
three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).
  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for
the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev
enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports
building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration. The dataset is

Abstract: Adoption of state-of-art Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) aims to
revolutionize many industrial areas by reducing the amount of human
intervention needed and effort for handling complex underlying processes.
Automotive software development is considered to be a significant area for
GenAI adoption, taking into account lengthy and expensive procedures, resulting
from the amount of requirements and strict standardization. In this paper, we
explore the adoption of GenAI for various steps of automotive software
development, mainly focusing on requirements handling, compliance aspects and
code generation. Three GenAI-related technologies are covered within the
state-of-art: Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG), Vision Language Models (VLMs), as well as overview of adopted prompting
techniques in case of code generation. Additionally, we also derive a
generalized GenAI-aided automotive software development workflow based on our
findings from this literature review. Finally, we include a summary of a survey
outcome, which was conducted among our automotive industry partners regarding
the type of GenAI tools used for their daily work activities.

### [367] [Can LLMs Generate User Stories and Assess Their Quality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15157)
*Giovanni Quattrocchi,Liliana Pasquale,Paola Spoletini,Luciano Baresi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用LLMs自动化需求获取和评估用户故事（US）的可行性，发现LLMs生成的US在覆盖率和风格质量上与人类相似，但多样性和创造性较低，且满足验收标准的频率较低。LLMs在明确评估标准下能可靠评估US的语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求获取是需求工程中最具挑战性的活动之一，且高质量需求的指定对软件质量至关重要。现有工具仅能评估语法质量，语义质量评估仍依赖人工。

Method: 使用10种先进的LLMs模拟客户访谈自动生成US，并与人类生成的US（领域专家和学生）进行质量对比，同时探索LLMs自动评估US语义质量的能力。

Result: LLMs生成的US在覆盖率和风格质量上与人类相似，但多样性和创造性较低，且较少满足验收标准。LLMs在明确标准下能可靠评估语义质量。

Conclusion: LLMs可辅助自动化需求获取和语义质量评估，减少人工工作量，但生成的US在多样性和验收标准满足度上仍需改进。

Abstract: Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of
the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements
analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete
requirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as
it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although
automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements,
evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency)
remains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can
help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where
requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs
to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer
interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with
the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also
explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the
semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar
to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower
diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in
quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality
criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally,
LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear
evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in
large-scale assessments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SimdBench是首个专门为SIMD指令代码生成设计的基准测试，包含136个任务，评估了18种LLM在SIMD代码生成中的表现，发现其性能普遍低于标量代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIMD指令编程在性能关键任务中广泛应用，但现有代码生成基准仅关注标量代码，缺乏对SIMD代码生成的评估。

Method: 提出SimdBench基准，包含136个任务，针对五种代表性SIMD指令集（SSE、AVX、Neon、SVE、RVV），系统评估18种LLM的代码生成能力。

Result: LLM在SIMD代码生成中的表现普遍低于标量代码生成，但分析指出了进一步改进的方向。

Conclusion: SimdBench填补了SIMD代码生成评估的空白，为LLM在该领域的改进提供了基础。

Abstract: SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions and their compiler
intrinsics are widely supported by modern processors to accelerate
performance-critical tasks. SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between
coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of
mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive
capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the
challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation
benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in
generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose
SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic
code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five
representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86
Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM
Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a
systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18
representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful
findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal
decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to
scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions
for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic
code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader
research community.

TL;DR: 论文研究了工具代理范式中参数失败的问题，提出了分类和改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索工具代理范式中参数失败的现象及其原因，以提高LLM的可靠性和有效性。

Method: 构建参数失败分类法，通过输入扰动方法分析输入源与失败类别的相关性。

Result: 实验表明参数名称幻觉失败源于LLM固有局限，其他失败模式主要由输入源问题引起。

Conclusion: 提出标准化工具返回格式、改进错误反馈机制和确保参数一致性等改进建议。

Abstract: The emergence of the tool agent paradigm has broadened the capability
boundaries of the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling it to complete more
complex tasks. However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to
the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon
and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure
taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation
chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between
three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input
perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter
name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while
issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the
reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose
corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return
formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter
consistency.

*Kechi Zhang,Ge Li,Jia Li,Huangzhao Zhang,Yihong Dong,Jia Li,Jingjing Xu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: StackTrans是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过引入隐藏状态栈来解决Transformer在捕获Chomsky层次结构（如正则表达式或确定性上下文无关文法）方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构虽强大，但在处理Chomsky层次结构时存在不足，无法有效捕获如正则表达式或确定性上下文无关文法。

Method: StackTrans在Transformer层之间引入隐藏状态栈，支持可微的栈操作（如压入和弹出），并与现有框架（如flash-attention）兼容。

Result: StackTrans在Chomsky层次结构和自然语言任务中均优于标准Transformer及其他基线模型，且参数效率更高。

Conclusion: StackTrans通过栈操作显著提升了Transformer在复杂语言结构上的表现，展现了高效性和推理能力。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the
broad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of
large language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and
the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still
has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to
effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or
deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown
automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using
stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.
Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans
explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This
design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention.
Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and
popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an
end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both
Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse
tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and
other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B
parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M
outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters,
showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.

TL;DR: SustainDiffusion是一种基于搜索的方法，旨在减少Stable Diffusion模型的社会和环境危害，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Stable Diffusion模型在社会和环境可持续性方面的负面影响。

Method: 通过搜索超参数和提示结构的最优组合，减少性别和种族偏见，并降低能耗。

Result: 性别偏见减少68%，种族偏见减少59%，能耗降低48%，且结果稳定且可推广。

Conclusion: 无需微调或改变模型架构，即可提升文本到图像生成模型的可持续性。

Abstract: Background: Text-to-image generation models are widely used across numerous
domains. Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source
text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12
billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises
concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.
  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the
environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to
enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.
  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters
and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated
images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image
generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to
that of the original SD model.
  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion,
testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our
results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%,
ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and
GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are
consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.
  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social
and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible
without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在自动程序修复中的实际效果，并研究程序员如何利用LLMs辅助调试。

Method: 采用随机分组实验，一组程序员使用LLMs，另一组不使用，通过程序验证工具评估修复的正确性。

Result: 实验结果与预期不同，揭示了LLMs在调试中的实际作用，并提出了7种LLMs使用模式。

Conclusion: 论文为LLMs在程序修复中的合理应用提供了方法论和实践建议。

Abstract: Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly,
Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an
attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of
satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in
practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually
work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to
complement their own skills?
  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a
program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of
proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly
assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without,
both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied
on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric
approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and
measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a
limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper
role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs.
  These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the
use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed
methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other
projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible
by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs,
with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs
for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.

TL;DR: FAMST是一种快速近似最小生成树算法，通过三阶段方法显著降低了大规模高维数据集的计算复杂度，时间复杂度和空间复杂度均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模高维数据集构建最小生成树（MST）时的计算挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：近似最近邻图构建、ANN组件间连接和迭代边优化。

Result: 在多种数据集上表现出低近似误差，速度提升高达1000倍，支持百万级数据点和数千维度的分析。

Conclusion: FAMST扩展了MST技术的应用范围，使其适用于以前认为不可行的大规模问题。

Abstract: We present Fast Approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (FAMST), a novel algorithm
that addresses the computational challenges of constructing Minimum Spanning
Trees (MSTs) for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. FAMST utilizes a
three-phase approach: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) graph construction,
ANN inter-component connection, and iterative edge refinement. For a dataset of
$n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space, FAMST achieves $\mathcal{O}(dn \log n)$
time complexity and $\mathcal{O}(dn + kn)$ space complexity when $k$ nearest
neighbors are considered, which is a significant improvement over the
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time and space complexity of traditional methods.
  Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that FAMST achieves
remarkably low approximation errors while providing speedups of up to
1000$\times$ compared to exact MST algorithms. We analyze how the key
hyperparameters, $k$ (neighborhood size) and $\lambda$ (inter-component edges),
affect performance, providing practical guidelines for hyperparameter
selection. FAMST enables MST-based analysis on datasets with millions of points
and thousands of dimensions, extending the applicability of MST techniques to
problem scales previously considered infeasible.

<details>

Motivation: 解决高维非凸HJI方程在随机微分博弈和鲁棒控制中的计算挑战。

Method: 交替求解固定反馈策略下的线性二阶PDE，并通过自动微分更新控制策略。

Result: 数值实验显示方法在二维和五维、十维问题中优于直接PINN求解器，误差低于10^{-2}%。

Conclusion: 结合PINNs和策略迭代是解决高维非凸HJI方程的有效方法，适用于机器人、金融和多智能体强化学习。

Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical
dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve
high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in
stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between
solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the
controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation.
Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the
value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity
solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz
regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without
requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic
path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference
benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and
ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise,
the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding
smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that
integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically
grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with
potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement
learning.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示模型架构与推理计算之间的可分离性，以优化非马尔可夫序列建模的效率。

Method: 通过自回归模型（如Transformer）在迭代推理中结构化上下文访问，模拟深度时序计算，并引入层次化时序分解。

Result: 实验表明，层次化时序分解在保持预测能力的同时减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 结论指出预测构建与优化的过程不必受限于模型架构，为模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parr et al., 2025 examines how auto-regressive and deep temporal models
differ in their treatment of non-Markovian sequence modelling. Building on
this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the
predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference.
We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive
models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a
transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing
hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains
predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises
that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily
bound to their underlying model architectures.

Motivation: 解决现有逆折叠方法在预测含非蛋白质组分和多结构状态复合物序列时的不足。

Result: 在单结构和多结构逆折叠任务中表现优异，适用于全原子蛋白质设计。

Conclusion: ADFLIP展示了在全原子蛋白质设计中的卓越潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold3 in modeling complex biomolecular
interactions, including those between proteins and ligands, nucleotides, or
metal ions, creates new opportunities for protein design. In so-called inverse
protein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts
a target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict
sequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly
with complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these
challenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein
folding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing
protein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP
progressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural
context during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein
complexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states.
Furthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling,
which allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the
designed sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance
of ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or
metal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were
determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse
folding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在医学图像分析中具有巨大潜力，但其预测准确性和校准误差在不同人口统计学子群中的表现需要深入分析，以确保安全部署到临床实践中。

Method: CALIN通过双层程序（从群体水平到子群水平）估计校准需求，并在推理时应用校准矩阵调整预测置信度。

Result: 在三个医学影像数据集上的实验表明，CALIN能有效确保公平的置信校准，同时提高预测准确性并最小化公平性与效用的权衡。

Conclusion: CALIN为解决MLLMs在医学图像分类中的校准偏差和不公平性提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform
few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However,
safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an
in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated
calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In
this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and
demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot
in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an
inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases.
Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by
calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the
population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this
estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.
Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image
classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for
chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair
confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall
prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off. Our

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种自监督联合重建和去噪模型，用于改进0.55T T2加权PROPELLER肺部MRI图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高低场强（0.55T）肺部MRI的图像清晰度和结构完整性，同时减少扫描时间。

Method: 使用44名COVID-19康复患者的T2加权肺部MRI数据，开发自监督学习框架，将PROPELLER采集的每个叶片分为两部分，分别用于训练重建网络和计算损失。与MPPCA去噪方法对比。

Result: 自监督模型显著提升了图像质量，与CT图像对齐良好，且扫描时间减少一半。放射科医生评估显示该方法优于MPPCA（p<0.001）。

Conclusion: 通过利用k空间子集的结构冗余性，自监督模型有效重建图像并抑制噪声，适用于0.55T T2加权肺部MRI。

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to improve 0.55T T2-weighted PROPELLER lung MRI
through a self-supervised joint reconstruction and denoising model.
  Methods: T2-weighted 0.55T lung MRI dataset including 44 patients with
previous covid infection were used. A self-supervised learning framework was
developed, where each blade of the PROPELLER acquisition was split along the
readout direction into two partitions. One subset trains the unrolled
reconstruction network, while the other subset is used for loss calculation,
enabling self-supervised training without clean targets and leveraging matched
noise statistics for denoising. For comparison, Marchenko-Pastur Principal
Component Analysis (MPPCA) was performed along the coil dimension, followed by
conventional parallel imaging reconstruction. The quality of the reconstructed
lung MRI was assessed visually by two experienced radiologists independently.
  Results: The proposed self-supervised model improved the clarity and
structural integrity of the lung images. For cases with available CT scans, the
reconstructed images demonstrated strong alignment with corresponding CT
images. Additionally, the proposed model enables further scan time reduction by
requiring only half the number of blades. Reader evaluations confirmed that the
proposed method outperformed MPPCA-denoised images across all categories
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement
(weighted Cohen's kappa=0.55; percentage of exact and within +/-1 point
agreement=91%).
  Conclusion: By leveraging intrinsic structural redundancies between two
disjoint splits of k-space subsets, the proposed self-supervised learning model
effectively reconstructs the image while suppressing the noise for 0.55T
T2-weighted lung MRI with PROPELLER sampling.

*Shrunal Pothagoni,Benjamin Schweinhart*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Persistent Homology Convolutions的新方法，通过局部持久同调数据改进CNN在医学图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN可能丢失拓扑信息，而拓扑在医学领域（如组织病理学）中至关重要。现有方法使用全局拓扑摘要，缺乏局部特征信息。

Method: 提出Persistent Homology Convolutions方法，通过改进的卷积算子生成局部持久同调数据，捕捉拓扑特征的局部性和平移不变性。

Result: 实验表明，使用该方法训练的模型性能优于传统模型，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: Persistent Homology Convolutions能有效提取组织病理学图像中的几何信息。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a standard tool for computer vision
tasks such as image classification. However, typical model architectures may
result in the loss of topological information. In specific domains such as
histopathology, topology is an important descriptor that can be used to
distinguish between disease-indicating tissue by analyzing the shape
characteristics of cells. Current literature suggests that reintroducing
topological information using persistent homology can improve medical
diagnostics; however, previous methods utilize global topological summaries
which do not contain information about the locality of topological features. To
address this gap, we present a novel method that generates local persistent
homology-based data using a modified version of the convolution operator called
Persistent Homology Convolutions. This method captures information about the
locality and translation invariance of topological features. We perform a
comparative study using various representations of histopathology slides and
find that models trained with persistent homology convolutions outperform
conventionally trained models and are less sensitive to hyperparameters. These
results indicate that persistent homology convolutions extract meaningful
geometric information from the histopathology slides.

*Cassandra Tong Ye,Shamus Li,Tyler King,Kristina Monakhova*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: QUTCC是一种非线性、非均匀的量化不确定性训练和校准技术，用于改进深度学习模型在医学成像任务中的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学成像任务中可能产生幻觉（虚假信息），这对准确性要求高的任务（如MRI去噪）带来风险。现有方法的不确定性边界较宽且信息量不足。

Method: 提出QUTCC技术，通过U-Net架构和量化嵌入预测完整的条件分布，并通过迭代查询上下分位数逐步细化不确定性边界。

Result: QUTCC在多个去噪任务和MRI重建中成功识别幻觉，并提供比现有方法更紧的不确定性区间，同时保持统计覆盖。

Conclusion: QUTCC显著提升了深度学习模型在医学成像任务中的可靠性和不确定性估计精度。

Abstract: Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that
are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for
scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising,
where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty
quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers
and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability.
However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate
uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose
QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables
nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter
uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding,
QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles
for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by
iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively
refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired
coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as
compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints
hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty
intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and
reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high
computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET
image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep
diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between
diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling
the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a
score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve
computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was
adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The
proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets.
For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested
on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one
[$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from
another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction
method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types,
providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET
imaging.

Abstract: Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children
in low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often
require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early
and accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep
learning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on
the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59
months. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other
demographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for
accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,
known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and
fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a
cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of
0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong
performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge
devices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of
different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.
Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high
accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive
quantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation.
Overall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and
hardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time,
and diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 研究证实，结合相关解剖背景能显著提升PCC分割精度，支持临床评估和长期监测。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is
essential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It
may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.
This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify
configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed
the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D
segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class
schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived
from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,
kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad
body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested
on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.
Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized
Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the
Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation
accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)
annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%
improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.
The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)
and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold
cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1
to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings
highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context in deep
learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, supporting clinical
assessment and longitudinal monitoring.

Result: 在205例cine MRI扫描中，方法与手动描绘结果一致，验证了无对比剂3D梗死重建的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为MI的高效数字孪生提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate representation of myocardial infarct geometry is crucial for
patient-specific cardiac modeling in MI patients. While Late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it
requires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.
Moreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D
slices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial
infarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for
contrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh
from multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.
Then, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to
explicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize
infarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our
method shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of contrast-free, cardiac motion-driven 3D infarct
reconstruction, paving the way for efficient digital twin of MI.

Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) provide personalized in-silico cardiac
representations and hold great potential for precision medicine in cardiology.
However, whole-heart CDT models that simulate the full organ-scale
electromechanics of all four heart chambers remain limited. In this work, we
propose a weakly supervised learning model to reconstruct 4D (3D+t) heart mesh
directly from multi-view 2D cardiac cine MRIs. This is achieved by learning a
self-supervised mapping between cine MRIs and 4D cardiac meshes, enabling the
generation of personalized heart models that closely correspond to input cine
MRIs. The resulting 4D heart meshes can facilitate the automatic extraction of
key cardiac variables, including ejection fraction and dynamic chamber volume
changes with high temporal resolution. It demonstrates the feasibility of
inferring personalized 4D heart models from cardiac MRIs, paving the way for an
efficient CDT platform for precision medicine. The code will be publicly
released once the manuscript is accepted.

Motivation: 内窥镜手术中血管细微运动的可视化对手术精度和决策至关重要，但由于手术场景的复杂性和动态性，这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: EndoControlMag采用周期性参考重置（PRR）和分层组织感知放大（HTM）框架，结合双模式掩模膨胀技术，适应不同的手术场景。

Result: 在EndoVMM24数据集上的评估表明，EndoControlMag在放大精度和视觉质量上显著优于现有方法，并在复杂手术条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EndoControlMag为内窥镜手术中的血管运动可视化提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for
surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the
complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce
EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with
mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic
environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference
Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with
dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while
maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification
(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores
using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization
despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive
softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that
modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,
or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force
attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical
scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while
distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow
conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four
different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including
occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.
Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations
demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in
both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness
across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results
are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.

Abstract: High-resolution volumetric computed tomography (CT) is essential for accurate

by radiation dose and hardware costs. We present the Transformer Volumetric
Super-Resolution Network (\textbf{TVSRN-V2}), a transformer-based
super-resolution (SR) framework designed for practical deployment in clinical
lung CT analysis. Built from scalable components, including Through-Plane
Attention Blocks (TAB) and Swin Transformer V2 -- our model effectively
reconstructs fine anatomical details in low-dose CT volumes and integrates
seamlessly with downstream analysis pipelines. We evaluate its effectiveness on
three critical lung cancer tasks -- lobe segmentation, radiomics, and prognosis
-- across multiple clinical cohorts. To enhance robustness across variable
acquisition protocols, we introduce pseudo-low-resolution augmentation,
simulating scanner diversity without requiring private data. TVSRN-V2
demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\% Dice),
higher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance
(+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of
structural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning
TVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient
imaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows.

Abstract: Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale
defects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel
surfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the
accuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex
environments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of
insufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small
target defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection
framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the
C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve
detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to
reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing
the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to
enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant
computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,
the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps
in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures
detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in
steel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively
addressing defect detection problems.

Conclusion: DeSamba为多序列医学影像的3D病变分类提供了一种通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency
domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in
medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for
robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose
DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel
framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse
spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a
Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from
different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,
and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,
enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion
characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On
a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1
accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external
validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On
a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification
task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal
and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that
both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over
10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the
potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion
classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RARE-UNet是一种分辨率感知的多尺度分割架构，通过动态调整推理路径以适应输入的空间分辨率，解决了现有模型在低分辨率数据下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型通常假设输入为固定高分辨率，在真实场景中遇到低分辨率数据时性能显著下降，限制了临床应用。

Method: RARE-UNet采用多尺度块集成到编码器多个深度，结合分辨率感知路由机制和一致性驱动训练，对齐多分辨率特征与全分辨率表示。

Result: 在脑成像任务（海马体和肿瘤分割）中，RARE-UNet的平均Dice分数最高（0.84和0.65），且在低分辨率下保持性能稳定并显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: RARE-UNet在实现分辨率鲁棒分割方面表现出高效性和可扩展性，适用于临床场景。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but existing
models often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly
when faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation
architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial
resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks
integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism,
and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with
full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain
imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard
UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves
the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while
maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at
lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of
our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音转换模型在实时性、语义保真度和未见说话人适应方面表现不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: Conan采用流式内容提取器（Emformer）、自适应风格编码器和因果混洗声码器（HiFiGAN）实现低延迟和高保真语音转换。

Result: 实验表明，Conan在主客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Conan为实时零样本语音转换提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for
real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle
to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver
natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker
characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise
online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the
source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan
comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages
Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style
Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for
enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully
causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective
metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在满足约束条件下显著提高了系统性能，神经网络和离散相位偏移方案为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging technology for
improving spectral efficiency and reducing power consumption in future wireless
systems. This paper investigates the joint design of the transmit precoding
matrices and the RIS phase shift vector in a multi-user RIS-aided
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. We formulate a
max-min optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate while
considering transmit power and reradiation mask constraints. The achievable
rate is simplified using the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, and the problem is
broken into quadratic programs with quadratic constraints (QPQC) sub-problems
using an alternating optimization approach. To improve efficiency, we develop a
model-based neural network optimization that utilizes the one-hot encoding for
the angles of incidence and reflection. We address practical RIS limitations by
using a greedy search algorithm to solve the optimization problem for discrete
phase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods
effectively shape the multi-beam radiation pattern towards desired directions
while satisfying reradiation mask constraints. The neural network design
reduces the execution time, and the discrete phase shift scheme performs well
with a small reduction of the beamforming gain by using only four phase shift
levels.

TL;DR: APTx Neuron是一种新型统一神经计算单元，将非线性激活和线性变换整合为单一可训练表达式，提高了计算效率和架构简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经元设计需要单独的激活层，增加了计算复杂性和架构冗余。APTx Neuron旨在通过统一设计简化架构并提升效率。

Method: APTx Neuron基于APTx激活函数，其表达式为$y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$，所有参数均可训练。

Conclusion: APTx Neuron在表达能力和计算效率上优于传统神经元，为统一神经元设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that
integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single
trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation
function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and
making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The
proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i +
\tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters
$\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our
APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\%
test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters.
The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency
of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new
paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

TL;DR: 论文研究了脉冲神经网络（SNNs）中神经元模型参数的优化空间，发现特定参数范围内网络表现最佳，超出则性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs具有高效能和生物合理性，但其性能依赖于神经元参数调优，需找到最佳操作空间以实现分类精度和能量效率的平衡。

Method: 通过系统探索数据集和架构，识别并量化神经元超参数（如膜时间常数和电压阈值）的操作空间。

Result: 在特定参数范围内，SNNs表现最优；超出范围会导致能量浪费或网络沉默。此外，对抗噪声下，非最优区域的SNNs表现出更高的脉冲相关性和内部同步性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了超参数调优的重要性，为部署高效稳健的SNNs提供了实用指南，尤其适用于神经形态计算场景。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient and biologically
plausible alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks, but their
performance depends critically on the tuning of neuron model parameters. In
this work, we identify and characterize an operational space - a constrained
region in the neuron hyperparameter domain (specifically membrane time constant
tau and voltage threshold vth) - within which the network exhibits meaningful
activity and functional behavior. Operating inside this manifold yields optimal
trade-offs between classification accuracy and spiking activity, while stepping
outside leads to degeneration: either excessive energy use or complete network
silence.
  Through systematic exploration across datasets and architectures, we
visualize and quantify this manifold and identify efficient operating points.
We further assess robustness to adversarial noise, showing that SNNs exhibit
increased spike correlation and internal synchrony when operating outside their
optimal region. These findings highlight the importance of principled
hyperparameter tuning to ensure both task performance and energy efficiency.
Our results offer practical guidelines for deploying robust and efficient SNNs,
particularly in neuromorphic computing scenarios.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三步解决方案，用于主动边缘流处理自动扩展问题，包括负载预测、迁移学习框架和动态并行度调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘流处理面临快速工作负载波动，现有方法反应滞后或资源浪费，需更高效解决方案。

Method: 使用GRU神经网络预测负载，迁移学习框架处理离线与在线数据差异，动态调整并行度。

Result: GRU模型在真实数据集上SMAPE值达1.3%，优于CNN、ARIMA和Prophet，且训练时间短。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在负载预测和资源分配上优于现有技术，适合边缘流处理场景。

Abstract: Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital
economies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data
processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing
places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing
analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream
processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource
provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas
excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as
threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance
degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime
adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive
machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that
minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge
stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts
the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a
transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online
stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution
adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains.
Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of
operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource
constraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to
1.3\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and
Prophet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than
the computationally intensive RL models.

Conclusion: ACME通过分布式定制方法有效解决了大模型部署中的挑战，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Pre-trained Transformer-based large models have revolutionized personal
virtual assistants, but their deployment in cloud environments faces challenges
related to data privacy and response latency. Deploying large models closer to
the data and users has become a key research area to address these issues.
However, applying these models directly often entails significant difficulties,
such as model mismatching, resource constraints, and energy inefficiency.
Automated design of customized models is necessary, but it faces three key
challenges, namely, the high cost of centralized model customization,
imbalanced performance from user heterogeneity, and suboptimal performance from
data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose ACME, an adaptive customization
approach of Transformer-based large models via distributed systems. To avoid
the low cost-efficiency of centralized methods, ACME employs a bidirectional
single-loop distributed system to progressively achieve fine-grained
collaborative model customization. In order to better match user heterogeneity,
it begins by customizing the backbone generation and identifying the Pareto
Front under model size constraints to ensure optimal resource utilization.
Subsequently, it performs header generation and refines the model using data
distribution-based personalized architecture aggregation to match data
heterogeneity. Evaluation on different datasets shows that ACME achieves
cost-efficient models under model size constraints. Compared to centralized
systems, data transmission volume is reduced to 6 percent. Additionally, the
average accuracy improves by 10 percent compared to the baseline, with the
trade-off metrics increasing by nearly 30 percent.

TL;DR: DecentLLMs提出了一种去中心化的多智能体LLM系统共识方法，通过并发生成答案和独立评分来提升鲁棒性和答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于领导者的多智能体系统易受攻击和答案质量低的问题。

Method: 采用去中心化架构，工作智能体并发生成答案，评估智能体独立评分和排序。

Result: 实验表明DecentLLMs能有效容忍恶意智能体并显著提升答案质量。

Conclusion: DecentLLMs为多智能体LLM系统提供了一种高效且鲁棒的共识方案。

Abstract: Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising
approach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as
hallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly
deployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of
tolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.
  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven
coordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are
inherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive
leaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus,
forcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high
latency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader
can be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are
available, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives
a quorum of votes.
  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized
consensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate
answers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these
answers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture
enables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and
consistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust
aggregation techniques.
  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates
Byzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.

TL;DR: SS2LD框架通过自监督学习改进传统HFO检测器，利用VAE和聚类生成弱监督标签，提高癫痫病理HFO的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFO检测器精度低且依赖人工标注，而监督学习需要大量标注数据，标注困难且不一致。

Method: 提出SS2LD框架，结合VAE进行形态预训练和聚类生成弱监督标签，训练分类器优化检测边界。

Result: 在多机构间期iEEG数据集上，SS2LD优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SS2LD提供了一种可扩展、标签高效且临床有效的病理HFO检测策略。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography
(iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in
epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer
from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require
time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been
used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled
datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized
expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low
inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across
institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological
HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we
leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant
signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the
Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of
candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of
pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for
morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the
detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision
for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine
detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on
large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and
clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy
detectors.

Result: 该方法能同时控制多个机械目标（包括线性和非线性响应），并在实验验证中展示了其高效性。

Conclusion: DiffuMeta为超材料定制化设计提供了高效且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have revolutionized material discovery by
capturing complex structure-property relationships, yet extending these
approaches to the inverse design of three-dimensional metamaterials remains
limited by computational complexity and underexplored design spaces due to the
lack of expressive representations. Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative
framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language
representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact,
unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct
application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion
models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain
responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while
addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions.
Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical
objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains.
Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy
of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with
tailored properties.

Motivation: 传统地震反演方法存在显著限制，如依赖1D平均小波和假设不现实的横向分辨率，需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: 采用Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)同时估计Point Spread Functions (PSFs)和声阻抗(IP)，通过自监督损失函数（MSE和SSIM）确保结果准确性。

Result: GINN能够生成高分辨率IP和真实PSFs，减少噪声并提高准确性，优于传统1D小波方法。

Conclusion: GINN展示了在地震反演中的潜力，未来将优化训练过程并在实际数据中验证。

Abstract: Model-based seismic inversion is a key technique in reservoir
characterization, but traditional methods face significant limitations, such as
relying on 1D average stationary wavelets and assuming an unrealistic lateral
resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a Geophysics-Informed
Neural Network (GINN) that integrates deep learning with seismic modeling. This
novel approach employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to
simultaneously estimate Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and acoustic impedance
(IP). PSFs are divided into zero-phase and residual components to ensure
geophysical consistency and to capture fine details. We used synthetic data
from the SEAM Phase I Earth Model to train the GINN for 100 epochs
(approximately 20 minutes) using a 2D UNet architecture. The network's inputs
include positional features and a low-frequency impedance (LF-IP) model. A
self-supervised loss function combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural
Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was employed to ensure accurate results. The
GINN demonstrated its ability to generate high-resolution IP and realistic
PSFs, aligning with expected geological features. Unlike traditional 1D
wavelets, the GINN produces PSFs with limited lateral resolution, reducing
noise and improving accuracy. Future work will aim to refine the training
process and validate the methodology with real seismic data.

Abstract: As a paradigm for sequential decision making in unknown environments,
reinforcement learning (RL) has received a flurry of attention in recent years.
However, the explosion of model complexity in emerging applications and the
presence of nonconvexity exacerbate the challenge of achieving efficient RL in
sample-starved situations, where data collection is expensive, time-consuming,
or even high-stakes (e.g., in clinical trials, autonomous systems, and online
advertising). How to understand and enhance the sample and computational
efficacies of RL algorithms is thus of great interest. In this tutorial, we aim
to introduce several important algorithmic and theoretical developments in RL,
highlighting the connections between new ideas and classical topics. Employing
Markov Decision Processes as the central mathematical model, we cover several
distinctive RL scenarios (i.e., RL with a simulator, online RL, offline RL,
robust RL, and RL with human feedback), and present several mainstream RL
approaches (i.e., model-based approach, value-based approach, and policy
optimization). Our discussions gravitate around the issues of sample
complexity, computational efficiency, as well as algorithm-dependent and
information-theoretic lower bounds from a non-asymptotic viewpoint.

Conclusion: 通过因果模型简化框架，可以有效地解释RL策略的行为，揭示其成功或失败的原因。

Abstract: Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a
challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of
agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on
explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and
rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random
perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on
the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that
explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model
Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency,
meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar
way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear
causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact
interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful
causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL
tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our
approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes
in trained RL policies.

easy-to-use imputation method called missing value imputation with adversarial
random forests (MissARF), based on generative machine learning, that provides
both single and multiple imputation. MissARF employs adversarial random forest
(ARF) for density estimation and data synthesis. To impute a missing value of
an observation, we condition on the non-missing values and sample from the
estimated conditional distribution generated by ARF. Our experiments
demonstrate that MissARF performs comparably to state-of-the-art single and
multiple imputation methods in terms of imputation quality and fast runtime
with no additional costs for multiple imputation.

TL;DR: 该研究利用AI方法从XMM-Newton探测到的ULXs数据库中筛选出新的候选脉冲ULXs（PULXs），尽管未发现新的脉冲信号，但验证了AI方法的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现超爱丁顿吸积中子星的快速可变信号改变了ULXs的理解，但受限于统计不足，需通过AI方法识别新的候选PULXs。

Method: 应用无监督聚类算法对ULXs数据库分类，利用已知PULXs设定阈值，筛选候选PULXs。

Result: 筛选出85个独特候选PULXs，355次观测，85%有多次观测，但未发现新脉冲信号。

Conclusion: AI方法展示了预测潜力，但需更高统计观测数据验证候选PULXs的脉冲信号。

Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington
accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX
class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among
others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy
missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate
pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate
PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable
combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of
ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm
to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the
sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold
between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate
PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of
an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs
counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new
candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no
new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new
candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in
a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the
absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear
example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the
need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the
sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.

TL;DR: ExCyTIn-Bench是首个用于评估LLM代理在网络安全威胁调查任务中的基准，基于调查图生成的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的安全分析师需要处理大量异构警报信号和安全日志，构建自动化的LLM代理进行威胁调查是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 通过从受控Azure租户构建数据集，包括8个模拟攻击、57个日志表和589个自动生成的问题，利用专家设计的检测逻辑构建调查图，并通过LLM生成问题。

Result: 实验显示任务难度较高，所有模型的平均奖励为0.249，最佳成绩为0.368，表明未来研究空间大。

Conclusion: ExCyTIn-Bench为LLM代理的开发与评估提供了可扩展、可解释的基准，并支持通过强化学习训练代理。

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on
the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from
investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large
number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop
chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of
LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a
promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we
construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated
real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and
related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage
security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat
investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes
on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as
answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only
provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the
pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the
automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be
naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our
comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the
task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is
0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future
research. Code and data are coming soon!

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PRM的安全对齐方法计算开销大且扩展性受限，亟需高效替代方案。

Method: 利用遗传算法优化、多智能体模拟和高级提示变异技术进行漏洞识别，结合课程学习和自适应正则化进行对抗训练。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上验证，性能优于PRM方法且计算成本降低61%。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限组织提供了高效安全对齐方案，并为应对动态对抗威胁奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse applications, yet they pose significant security risks that threaten
their safe deployment in critical domains. Current security alignment
methodologies predominantly rely on Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate
intermediate reasoning steps, introducing substantial computational overhead
and scalability constraints. This paper presents a novel PRM-free security
alignment framework that leverages automated red teaming and adversarial
training to achieve robust security guarantees while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities through
sophisticated attack strategies including genetic algorithm optimization,
multi-agent simulation, and advanced prompt mutation techniques. The framework
enhances model robustness via targeted adversarial training with curriculum
learning and adaptive regularization mechanisms. Comprehensive experimental
evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates that our method
achieves superior security alignment performance compared to PRM-based
approaches while reducing computational costs by 61\%. The framework
incorporates transparent reporting and continuous audit mechanisms that enable
iterative security improvement and regulatory compliance. Our contributions
advance the field of efficient LLM security alignment by democratizing access
to robust security measures for resource-constrained organizations and
providing a scalable foundation for addressing evolving adversarial threats.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的入侵检测系统（IDS）方法，通过Interpretable Generalization（IG）机制和Multi-Granular Discretization（IG-MD）技术，实现了高精度和完全可审计的规则生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法在入侵检测系统中通常仅提供部分解释，可能导致误导性见解，因此需要一种更透明且高效的方法。

Method: 采用IG机制学习独特的特征组合，并将其转化为可审计规则；进一步引入IG-MD技术，通过多粒度离散化提升精度。

Result: 在多个数据集（NSL-KDD、UNSW-NB15、UKM-IDS20）上表现出色，IG-MD在UKM-IDS20上提升精度≥4%，同时保持召回率≈1.0。

Conclusion: IG-MD证明了单一可解释模型无需定制调整即可跨领域扩展，同时保持高精度和透明度。

Abstract: Explainable intrusion detection systems (IDS) are now recognized as essential
for mission-critical networks, yet most "XAI" pipelines still bolt an
approximate explainer onto an opaque classifier, leaving analysts with partial
and sometimes misleading insights. The Interpretable Generalization (IG)
mechanism, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and
Security, eliminates that bottleneck by learning coherent patterns - feature
combinations unique to benign or malicious traffic - and turning them into
fully auditable rules. IG already delivers outstanding precision, recall, and
AUC on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and UKM-IDS20, even when trained on only 10% of the
data. To raise precision further without sacrificing transparency, we introduce
Multi-Granular Discretization (IG-MD), which represents every continuous
feature at several Gaussian-based resolutions. On UKM-IDS20, IG-MD lifts
precision by greater than or equal to 4 percentage points across all nine
train-test splits while preserving recall approximately equal to 1.0,
demonstrating that a single interpretation-ready model can scale across domains
without bespoke tuning.

Method: 提出AdViT攻击方法，生成能同时误导Transformer模型及其解释模型的对抗样本。

Result: 在多种Transformer模型和解释模型上，AdViT在白盒和黑盒场景下攻击成功率均为100%，且生成准确的解释。

Conclusion: AdViT揭示了Transformer模型及其解释模型在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，为安全研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are
regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for
security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles,
drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to
severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily
focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive
the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model
interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively
assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the
vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined
with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates
adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and
its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various
transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that
AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box
scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification
confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%
misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate
interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more
difficult to detect.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) based on cryptographic protocols
has emerged as a promising paradigm to protect user data privacy in cloud-based
machine learning services. While it achieves formal privacy protection, PPML
often incurs significant efficiency and scalability costs due to orders of
magnitude overhead compared to the plaintext counterpart. Therefore, there has
been a considerable focus on mitigating the efficiency gap for PPML. In this
survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of recent PPML studies
with a focus on cross-level optimizations. Specifically, we categorize existing
papers into protocol level, model level, and system level, and review progress
at each level. We also provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons of
existing works with technical insights, based on which we discuss future
research directions and highlight the necessity of integrating optimizations
across protocol, model, and system levels. We hope this survey can provide an
overarching understanding of existing approaches and potentially inspire future
breakthroughs in the PPML field. As the field is evolving fast, we also provide
a public GitHub repository to continuously track the developments, which is
available at https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/Awesome-PPML-Papers.

TL;DR: VTarbel是一种针对垂直联邦学习（VFL）的两阶段攻击框架，旨在绕过检测器并实现定向错误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VFL中的安全威胁，尤其是定向标签攻击，填补现有方法忽略检测器的不足。

Method: VTarbel通过两阶段攻击：准备阶段选择高表达样本训练本地模型，攻击阶段生成对抗样本绕过检测。

Result: VTarbel在多种模型、数据集和检测器下表现优异，成功绕过检测并保持攻击效果。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前VFL部署中的安全盲点，呼吁开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables multiple parties with disjoint
features to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. While
privacy vulnerabilities of VFL are extensively-studied, its security
threats-particularly targeted label attacks-remain underexplored. In such
attacks, a passive party perturbs inputs at inference to force
misclassification into adversary-chosen labels. Existing methods rely on
unrealistic assumptions (e.g., accessing VFL-model's outputs) and ignore
anomaly detectors deployed in real-world systems. To bridge this gap, we
introduce VTarbel, a two-stage, minimal-knowledge attack framework explicitly
designed to evade detector-enhanced VFL inference. During the preparation
stage, the attacker selects a minimal set of high-expressiveness samples (via
maximum mean discrepancy), submits them through VFL protocol to collect
predicted labels, and uses these pseudo-labels to train estimated detector and
surrogate model on local features. In attack stage, these models guide
gradient-based perturbations of remaining samples, crafting adversarial
instances that induce targeted misclassifications and evade detection. We
implement VTarbel and evaluate it against four model architectures, seven
multimodal datasets, and two anomaly detectors. Across all settings, VTarbel
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines, evades detection, and retains
effective against three representative privacy-preserving defenses. These
results reveal critical security blind spots in current VFL deployments and
underscore urgent need for robust, attack-aware defenses.

TL;DR: VMask是一种新型标签隐私保护框架，通过层掩码技术防御模型完成攻击，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低标签推断准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 垂直联邦学习（VFL）易受标签推断攻击，尤其是模型完成攻击，现有防御方法要么牺牲模型准确性，要么计算开销过大。

Method: 采用秘密共享技术掩码攻击者模型的关键层参数，破坏输入数据与中间输出的强相关性，并提供可调隐私预算。

Result: VMask在13个数据集和5种模型架构上表现最佳，将标签推断准确率降至随机猜测水平，模型性能下降仅0.09%，运行速度远超密码学方法。

Conclusion: VMask在隐私保护与模型性能之间实现了最佳平衡，计算开销低，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Though vertical federated learning (VFL) is generally considered to be
privacy-preserving, recent studies have shown that VFL system is vulnerable to
label inference attacks originating from various attack surfaces. Among these
attacks, the model completion (MC) attack is currently the most powerful one.
Existing defense methods against it either sacrifice model accuracy or incur
impractical computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel
label privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from
the perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong
correlation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret
sharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We
devise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead
that would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask
is the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing
for flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual
requirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively
evaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different
modalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate
that VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting
the MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing
level) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model,
the averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%). VMask's runtime is up
to 60,846 times faster than cryptography-based methods, and it only marginally
exceeds that of standard VFL by 1.8 times in a large Transformer-based model,
which is generally acceptable.

TL;DR: LLM-based web navigation agents are powerful but vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where adversaries manipulate HTML to hijack agent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the security risks of LLM-driven web agents, particularly their susceptibility to IPI attacks.

Method: Used Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent (Llama-3.1) to test attacks on real websites.

Result: High success rates in targeted and general attacks, including credential theft and forced ad clicks.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent need for stronger defenses as LLM web agents gain adoption.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that LLM-based web navigation agents offer powerful
automation capabilities but are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI)
attacks. We show that adversaries can embed universal adversarial triggers in
webpage HTML to hijack agent behavior that utilizes the accessibility tree to

Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent powered by
Llama-3.1, our system demonstrates high success rates across real websites in
both targeted and general attacks, including login credential exfiltration and
forced ad clicks. Our empirical results highlight critical security risks and
the need for stronger defenses as LLM-driven autonomous web agents become more
widely adopted. The system software

TL;DR: PromptArmor是一种简单有效的防御方法，通过检测和移除注入的恶意提示来保护LLM代理免受提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理容易受到提示注入攻击，导致执行恶意任务而非用户意图，因此需要一种防御机制。

Method: 使用现成的LLM（如GPT-4o）检测并移除输入中的潜在注入提示。

Result: PromptArmor在AgentDojo基准测试中误报率和漏报率均低于1%，攻击成功率降至1%以下。

Conclusion: PromptArmor应作为评估新防御方法的标准基线。

Abstract: Despite their potential, recent research has demonstrated that LLM agents are
vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious prompts are injected
into the agent's input, causing it to perform an attacker-specified task rather
than the intended task provided by the user. In this paper, we present
PromptArmor, a simple yet effective defense against prompt injection attacks.
Specifically, PromptArmor prompts an off-the-shelf LLM to detect and remove
potential injected prompts from the input before the agent processes it. Our
results show that PromptArmor can accurately identify and remove injected
prompts. For example, using GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, or o4-mini, PromptArmor achieves
both a false positive rate and a false negative rate below 1% on the AgentDojo
benchmark. Moreover, after removing injected prompts with PromptArmor, the
attack success rate drops to below 1%. We also demonstrate PromptArmor's
effectiveness against adaptive attacks and explore different strategies for
prompting an LLM. We recommend that PromptArmor be adopted as a standard
baseline for evaluating new defenses against prompt injection attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼邮件因其广泛传播和低成本成为网络犯罪的关键环节，传统检测方法难以应对其不断演变的特性，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现进一步加剧了威胁。

Method: PiMRef将钓鱼邮件检测重新定义为身份事实核查任务，包括提取发件人身份、验证域名合法性以及检测行动呼吁提示。

Result: PiMRef在标准基准测试中提升了8.8%的精确度，实际评估中达到92.1%的精确度和87.9%的召回率，运行效率高。

Conclusion: PiMRef通过知识驱动的身份验证方法，有效应对LLM生成的钓鱼邮件，为防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Phishing emails are a critical component of the cybercrime kill chain due to
their wide reach and low cost. Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional
rule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms
race between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs)
further exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing
phishing emails at minimal cost.
  This work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive
phishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all
commercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose
PiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages
knowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails
often contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts.
PiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an
email, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the
legitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and
(iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory
claims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable
explanations.
  Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector,
PiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks
like Nazario and PhishPot. In a real-world evaluation of 10,183 emails across
five university accounts over three years, PiMRef achieved 92.1% precision,
87.9% recall, and a median runtime of 0.05s, outperforming the state-of-the-art
in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as
Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is
prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts
to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise
LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses
mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM
integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for
these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory,
optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks
are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context
(e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety
measures are in place.
  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including
statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization
techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is
supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we
derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training
and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with
high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input
transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by
an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and
empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work
highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond
single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both
attacks and defenses.

Abstract: Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at
city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering
is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from
previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering
methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene
because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed
for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for
reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of
geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view
synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit
use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene
(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,
implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids
explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational
cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the
scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth
information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex
scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is
independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines
geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering
large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than
using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach
can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
applications.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and
industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a
significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both
object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D
scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality
textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout
optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and
inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the
input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.
Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by
constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene
depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal
alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.
Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer
distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout
parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains
precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on
multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture
fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages
in scene layout synthesis.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持原始形状保真度和文本描述一致性方面优于其他技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过坐标混合算法实现了高效的局部编辑，避免了计算成本高且不准确的反演过程。

Abstract: Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized
fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in
preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this
work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented
as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for
achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a
partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the
shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within
the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending
algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a
progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate
blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited
version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing
the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques
across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original
shape and also adherence to the textual description.

Conclusion: ObjectGS成功将语义理解融入3D重建，提升了对象级感知能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and
real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits
object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware
framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual
objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,
enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically
grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID
encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We
show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,
but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene
editing. Project page: https://ruijiezhu94.github.io/ObjectGS_page

Conclusion: 离散化SDF方法有效提升了逆渲染质量，同时避免了传统方法的复杂性和高内存消耗。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and
highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The
application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the
discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry
constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra
continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian
primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing
memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a
discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by
encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us
to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity
transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the
computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the
discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete
representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal
loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and
enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based
consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher
relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding
complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method
outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.

Conclusion: NBM为动态不确定性建模提供了一种新方法，其可学习的参数化特性使其在金融、控制等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural-Brownian Motion (NBM), a new class of
stochastic processes for modeling dynamics under learned uncertainty. The NBM
is defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with
respect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural
Expectation Operator, $\varepsilon^\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic
Differential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a
neural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical
NBM, which we define as a continuous $\varepsilon^\theta$-martingale with zero
drift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural
assumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong
solution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\rm d} M_t =
\nu_\theta(t, M_t) {\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function
$\nu_\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the
algebraic constraint $g_\theta(t, M_t, \nu_\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where
$g_\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic
calculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic
case, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The
character of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously
determined by the learned parameters $\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation
for models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature.

Motivation: 城市空中交通系统需要灵活的路径规划以应对实时乘客需求，同时确保通信质量以保障安全。传统方法缺乏这种灵活性。

Method: 构建无线电地图评估通信质量，提出MSHA-RL框架，通过多源数据对齐和混合注意力机制实现实时路径规划。

Result: 实验表明该方法能减少旅行时间并提高运营效率，同时确保通信合规和乘客安全。

Conclusion: MSHA-RL框架为UAM系统提供了一种高效、安全的实时路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are rapidly emerging as promising solutions
to alleviate urban congestion, with path planning becoming a key focus area.
Unlike ground transportation, UAM trajectory planning has to prioritize
communication quality for accurate location tracking in constantly changing
environments to ensure safety. Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,
requires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,
especially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable
and dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on
predefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.
To address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map
to evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we
introduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning
(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and
UAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between
the representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse
data sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to
balance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time
path planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach
enables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and
enhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety.

Abstract: 3D human motion forecasting aims to enable autonomous applications.
Estimating uncertainty for each prediction (i.e., confidence based on
probability density or quantile) is essential for safety-critical contexts like
human-robot collaboration to minimize risks. However, existing diverse motion
forecasting approaches struggle with uncertainty quantification due to implicit
probabilistic representations hindering uncertainty modeling. We propose
ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a
disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A
forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions,
allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI
achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while
validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making.

Abstract: Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels
presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic
disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but
they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow
recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this
work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for
hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We
develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates
local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a
disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which
infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances
are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement
learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during
lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time
disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract
transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe
wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time
flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in
aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on
the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,
circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and
fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs
attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual
processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,
uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how
incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both
efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image
processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both
human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA
robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously
collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as
well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that
incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated
patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.
Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number
of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions
of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction
from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide
foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,
allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results
show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces
computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks
and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that
human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic
vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/

Result: 实验显示，Flora平均减少6% HPWL、5.16% FTpin、29.15% FTmod，组件布局性能提升14%。

Conclusion: Flora通过跨阶段优化，显著优于现有平面规划方法。

Abstract: Floorplanning determines the shapes and locations of modules on a chip canvas
and plays a critical role in optimizing the chip's Power, Performance, and Area
(PPA) metrics. However, existing floorplanning approaches often fail to
integrate with subsequent physical design stages, leading to suboptimal
in-module component placement and excessive inter-module feedthrough. To tackle
this challenge, we propose Flora, a three-stage feedthrough and placement aware
rectilinear floorplanner. In the first stage, Flora employs wiremask and
position mask techniques to achieve coarse-grained optimization of HPWL and
feedthrough. In the second stage, under the constraint of a fixed outline,
Flora achieves a zero-whitespace layout by locally resizing module shapes,
thereby performing fine-grained optimization of feedthrough and improving
component placement. In the third stage, Flora utilizes a fast tree
search-based method to efficiently place components-including macros and
standard cells-within each module, subsequently adjusting module boundaries
based on the placement results to enable cross-stage optimization. Experimental
results show that Flora outperforms recent state-of-the-art floorplanning
approaches, achieving an average reduction of 6% in HPWL, 5.16% in FTpin,
29.15% in FTmod, and a 14% improvement in component placement performance.

Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due

consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions.
When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more
efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic
manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on

concludes by identifying key open challenges and outlining promising avenues
for future research. Special attention is given to hybrid approaches that
integrate DRL with classical planning techniques to leverage the benefits of
both learning-based adaptability and deterministic reliability, offering
promising directions for robust and resilient autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and rule-compliant behavior of autonomous agents in
uncertain environments remains a fundamental challenge in modern robotics. Our
work shows how neuro-symbolic systems, which integrate probabilistic, symbolic
white-box reasoning models with deep learning methods, offer a powerful
solution to this challenge. This enables the simultaneous consideration of
explicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength
of structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we
introduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to
enhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep
probabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in
shared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt,
implemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as
travel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial
mobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous
systems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain
environments safely and compliantly.

Result: PSEAD提高了泛化能力、可解释性和计算效率，适用于蛋白质折叠和药物发现等动态过程。

Conclusion: PSEAD为新一代生物信息学和对称性感知AI模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention
Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to
seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of
self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept
of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving
that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a
direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components
are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting
permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for
disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers
substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to
novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented
interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention
contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational
efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric
subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to
dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms,
showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of
biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding
and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of
biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.

Abstract: This research introduces an innovative voice-assisted debugging plugin for
Python that transforms silent runtime errors into actionable audible
diagnostics. By implementing a global exception hook architecture with pyttsx3
text-to-speech conversion and Tkinter-based GUI visualization, the solution
delivers multimodal error feedback through parallel auditory and visual
channels. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 37% reduced cognitive load (p<0.01,
n=50) compared to traditional stack-trace debugging, while enabling 78% faster
error identification through vocalized exception classification and
contextualization. The system achieves sub-1.2 second voice latency with under
18% CPU overhead during exception handling, vocalizing error types and
consequences while displaying interactive tracebacks with documentation deep
links. Criteria validate compatibility across Python 3.7+ environments on
Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Needing only two lines of integration
code, the plugin significantly boosts availability for aesthetically impaired
designers and supports multitasking workflows through hands-free error medical
diagnosis. Educational applications show particular promise, with pilot studies
indicating 45% faster debugging skill acquisition among novice programmers.
Future development will incorporate GPT-based repair suggestions and real-time
multilingual translation to further advance auditory debugging paradigms. The
solution represents a fundamental shift toward human-centric error diagnostics,
bridging critical gaps in programming accessibility while establishing new
standards for cognitive efficiency in software development workflows.

TL;DR: 论文指出，传统Transformer模型的计算负载分为内存受限的多头注意力（MHA）和计算受限的前馈层。但近期架构变化（如MLA和MoE）挑战了专用注意力硬件的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究传统Transformer模型的计算负载分化和专用硬件需求是否仍适用于新架构（MLA和MoE）。

Method: 分析MLA和MoE的算术强度及其对硬件需求的影响。

Result: MLA的算术强度比MHA高两个数量级，接近计算受限模式；MoE通过批处理可匹配密集层的算术强度。

Conclusion: 专用注意力硬件的需求减少，下一代Transformer需设计平衡的系统以满足多样化的计算需求。

Abstract: Computational workloads composing traditional Transformer models are starkly
bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is memory-bound, with low arithmetic
intensity, while feedforward layers are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long
motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck.
  This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent
Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of
specialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the
arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that
of MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern
accelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of
accelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match
that of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.
  These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware.
The central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer
accelerating a single memory-bound layer. Instead, the focus must shift to
designing balanced systems with sufficient compute, memory capacity, memory
bandwidth, and high-bandwidth interconnects to manage the diverse demands of
large-scale models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家知识特征压缩和解耦表示学习的双策略方法，用于解决低空网络覆盖预测中的数据稀疏和特征不平衡问题，实验表明其优于基线算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空网络覆盖预测对设计空中走廊至关重要，但基站天线波束模式通常不可获取，且低空测试数据稀疏，导致特征采样不平衡和泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合专家知识进行特征压缩以降低复杂度，并利用解耦表示学习增强模型泛化能力，通过传播模型和子网络捕获潜在特征的语义表示。

Result: 实验显示误差比最佳基线算法降低7%，实际网络验证中MAE误差达到5dB水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低空网络覆盖预测中的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of
Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors.
While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base
Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily
accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam
information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage
prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is
cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity
results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited
variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of
substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished
generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based
feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former
reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while
the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of
propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the
semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms
the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the
best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its
reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB
level.

Conclusion: 工程瓶颈可解决，提出15年路线图，最终实现完全自主的轨道覆盖。

Abstract: In 2023, satellite and mobile networks crossed a historic threshold: standard
smartphones, using unmodified 3GPP protocols, connected directly to low Earth
orbit (LEO) satellites. This first wave of direct-to-device (D2D)
demonstrations validated the physical feasibility of satellite-based mobile
access. However, these systems remain fallback-grade--rural-only,
bandwidth-limited, and fully dependent on Earth-based mobile cores for
identity, session, and policy control. This paper asks a more ambitious
question: Can a complete mobile network, including radio access, core
functions, traffic routing, and content delivery, operate entirely from orbit?
And can it deliver sustained, urban-grade service in the world's densest
cities? We present the first end-to-end system architecture for a fully orbital
telco, integrating electronically steered phased arrays with 1000-beam
capacity, space-based deployment of 5G core functions (UPF, AMF), and
inter-satellite laser mesh backhaul. We analyze spectral efficiency, beam
capacity, and link budgets under dense urban conditions, accounting for path
loss, Doppler, and multipath. Simulations show that rooftop and line-of-sight
users can sustain 64-QAM throughput, while street-level access is feasible with
relay or assisted beam modes. The paper outlines the remaining constraints,
power, thermal dissipation, compute radiation hardening, and regulatory models,
and demonstrates that these are engineering bottlenecks, not physical limits.
Finally, we propose a staged 15-year roadmap from today's fallback D2D systems
to autonomous orbital overlays delivering 50-100 Mbps to handhelds in
megacities, with zero reliance on terrestrial infrastructure.

TL;DR: PRATA是一个基于AI的预测性QoS框架，用于优化远程驾驶应用，通过强化学习（RL）平衡QoS和QoE，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程驾驶对延迟和可靠性要求严格，预测性QoS（PQoS）能提前应对网络变化，避免性能下降。

Method: PRATA框架包含5G RAN模拟、汽车数据生成工具和AI单元，设计了RL单元RAN-AI优化数据传输。

Result: RAN-AI在资源饱和或信道退化时高效平衡QoS与QoE，性能比基线方法提升近一倍。

Conclusion: PRATA展示了AI在PQoS中的潜力，RL单元RAN-AI为远程驾驶提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS) makes it possible to anticipate QoS
changes, e.g., in wireless networks, and trigger appropriate countermeasures to
avoid performance degradation. Hence, PQoS is extremely useful for automotive
applications such as teleoperated driving, which poses strict constraints in
terms of latency and reliability. A promising tool for PQoS is given by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a methodology that enables the design of
decision-making strategies for stochastic optimization. In this manuscript, we
present PRATA, a new simulation framework to enable PRedictive QoS based on AI
for Teleoperated driving Applications. PRATA consists of a modular pipeline
that includes (i) an end-to-end protocol stack to simulate the 5G Radio Access
Network (RAN), (ii) a tool for generating automotive data, and (iii) an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) unit to optimize PQoS decisions. To prove its
utility, we use PRATA to design an RL unit, named RAN-AI, to optimize the
segmentation level of teleoperated driving data in the event of resource
saturation or channel degradation. Hence, we show that the RAN-AI entity
efficiently balances the trade-off between QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE)
that characterize teleoperated driving applications, almost doubling the system
performance compared to baseline approaches. In addition, by varying the
learning settings of the RAN-AI entity, we investigate the impact of the state
space and the relative cost of acquiring network data that are necessary for
the implementation of RL.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent automation becomes an important feature to deal with the
increased complexity in managing wireless networks. This paper proposes a novel
automation approach of intent-based network for Radio Access Networks (RANs)
management by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method
enhances intent translation, autonomously interpreting high-level objectives,
reasoning over complex network states, and generating precise configurations of
the RAN by integrating LLMs within an agentic architecture. We propose a
structured prompt engineering technique and demonstrate that the network can
automatically improve its energy efficiency by dynamically optimizing critical
RAN parameters through a closed-loop mechanism. It showcases the potential to
enable robust resource management in RAN by adapting strategies based on
real-time feedback via LLM-orchestrated agentic systems.

Abstract: The Internet is poised to host billions to trillions of autonomous AI agents
that negotiate, delegate, and migrate in milliseconds and workloads that will
strain DNS-centred identity and discovery. In this paper, we describe the NANDA
index architecture, which we envision as a means for discoverability,
identifiability and authentication in the internet of AI agents. We present an
architecture where a minimal lean index resolves to dynamic, cryptographically
verifiable AgentFacts that supports multi-endpoint routing, load balancing,
privacy-preserving access, and credentialed capability assertions. Our
architecture design delivers five concrete guarantees: (1) A quilt-like index
proposal that supports both NANDA-native agents as well as third party agents
being discoverable via the index, (2) rapid global resolution for newly spawned
AI agents, (3) sub-second revocation and key rotation, (4) schema-validated
capability assertions, and (5) privacy-preserving discovery across
organisational boundaries via verifiable, least-disclosure queries. We
formalize the AgentFacts schema, specify a CRDT-based update protocol, and
prototype adaptive resolvers. The result is a lightweight, horizontally
scalable foundation that unlocks secure, trust-aware collaboration for the next
generation of the Internet of AI agents, without abandoning existing web
infrastructure.

Motivation: 解决语义通信在图像分割中计算效率与带宽需求之间的不平衡问题，特别是在资源受限和信道条件变化的环境中。

Method: 将语义图像分割过程分割在资源受限的发送端和接收端之间，减少传输数据量并降低发送端的计算负担。

Result: 实验结果显示，传输比特率降低了72%，发送端计算负载减少了19%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在通信系统（尤其是未来6G系统）中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Semantic communication represents a promising technique towards reducing
communication costs, especially when dealing with image segmentation, but it
still lacks a balance between computational efficiency and bandwidth
requirements while maintaining high image segmentation accuracy, particularly
in resource-limited environments and changing channel conditions. On the other
hand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,
the more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a
novel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the
semantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter
and the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data
while maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.
Additionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource
constrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation
in the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of
simulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as
computational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The
results when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation
in the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the
transmission process. In addition, the computational load of the transmitter is
reduced by more than 19%. This reflects the interest of this technique for its
application in communication systems, particularly in the upcoming 6G systems.

Motivation: 未来移动系统和固定无线网络需要支持高带宽、低延迟的服务，尤其是在工业物联网、XR和H2M协作等场景中。如何实时同步XR内容并避免用户晕动症是主要挑战。

Method: 使用双向LSTM网络预测人类头部运动，提前调整机器摄像头方向，并动态分配带宽（HMC-DBA）。

Conclusion: HMC-DBA方案在实时XR内容同步和网络资源优化方面优于现有技术，适用于企业网络环境。

Abstract: The evolution towards future generation of mobile systems and fixed wireless
networks is primarily driven by the urgency to support high-bandwidth and
low-latency services across various vertical sectors. This endeavor is fueled
by smartphones as well as technologies like industrial internet of things,
extended reality (XR), and human-to-machine (H2M) collaborations for fostering
industrial and social revolutions like Industry 4.0/5.0 and Society 5.0. To
ensure an ideal immersive experience and avoid cyber-sickness for users in all
the aforementioned usage scenarios, it is typically challenging to synchronize
XR content from a remote machine to a human collaborator according to their
head movements across a large geographic span in real-time over communication
networks. Thus, we propose a novel H2M collaboration scheme where the human's
head movements are predicted ahead with highly accurate models like
bidirectional long short-term memory networks to orient the machine's camera in
advance. We validate that XR frame size varies in accordance with the human's
head movements and predict the corresponding bandwidth requirements from the
machine's camera to propose a human-machine coordinated dynamic bandwidth
allocation (HMC-DBA) scheme. Through extensive simulations, we show that
end-to-end latency and jitter requirements of XR frames are satisfied with much
lower bandwidth consumption over enterprise networks like
Fiber-To-The-Room-Business. Furthermore, we show that better efficiency in
network resource utilization is achieved by employing our proposed HMC-DBA over
state-of-the-art schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型在建模时空动态和通道置换等变性方面存在不足，限制了其在不同电极配置下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DIVER-0模型，采用全时空注意力、Rotary Position Embedding（RoPE）和Sliding Temporal Conditional Positional Encoding（STCPE）技术。

Result: DIVER-0仅需10%的预训练数据即达到竞争性能，并在所有通道置换条件下保持一致性。

Conclusion: DIVER-0为处理神经记录设置的异质性提供了关键设计原则，验证了其跨数据集泛化的有效性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in
brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG
foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics
and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization
across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we
propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full
spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal
processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary
Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention
biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal
Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing
conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal
translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust
adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining.
Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance
with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across
all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for
cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for
handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.

Result: 在五种减少通道配置中，Self-DANA显著提升资源效率，性能达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: Self-DANA是一种高效且易于集成的解决方案，适用于减少通道的ECG分析。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on
extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream
tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also
grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their
transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of
wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel
configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream
scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated.
In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that
makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input
channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce
Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a
more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five
reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly
enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It
requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about
17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to
its progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel
approach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD
severity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data
from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant
neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional
Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%.
Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed
experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate
these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed
approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving
patient care in Parkinson's disease management.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的方法，用于提高心室内单相动作电位（MAP）信号的质量，相比传统滤波方法表现出更优的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏电生理学中，心内信号的噪声会干扰心律失常和心肌病的诊断与治疗，传统去噪方法难以应对多样化的非线性、非平稳噪声。

Method: 使用VAE模型，基于5706个时间序列数据集（来自42名缺血性心肌病患者）构建干净信号的表示。

Result: VAE模型在多种噪声类型（包括临床常见的时变非线性噪声）下表现出更优的去噪能力。

Conclusion: VAE能够有效消除单次心跳中的多种噪声源，优于现有技术，有望提升心脏电生理学的治疗效果。

Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in
intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of
arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction
techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various
sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This
work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the
quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal
recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of
5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our
approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to
conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We
assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its
superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including
time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These
results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single
beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially
improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.

Motivation: 传统HDC方法依赖静态随机投影，缺乏任务适应性，因此需要一种更灵活且可解释的ECG分类方法。

Method: 采用基于RR间隔的节奏感知编码管道，结合神经蒸馏HDC架构和BinaryLinear投影层，优化交叉熵和代理度量损失。

Result: 在Apnea-ECG和PTB-XL数据集上表现优于传统HDC和经典ML方法，精度达73.09%，F1分数0.626。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘兼容的ECG分类提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，适用于个性化健康监测。

Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram
(ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC)
with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on
static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable
encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation
strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a
neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a
BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with
cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the
symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation
learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model
significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving
73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable
robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution
for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的阻抗编码-解码方法，用于在线构建阻抗网络模型，解决了传统方法中高密度阻抗曲线传输困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统阻抗网络模型构建需要传输大量高密度阻抗曲线，难以在线应用，因此需要一种高效的数据压缩与重构方法。

Method: 训练阻抗编码器压缩阻抗曲线，上传压缩数据至风电场，再训练阻抗解码器重构原始曲线，最后基于节点导纳矩阵方法获得阻抗网络模型。

Result: 通过模型训练和实时仿真验证，编码后的阻抗向量能快速传输并准确重构原始阻抗曲线。

Conclusion: AI编码-解码方法有效解决了阻抗网络模型在线构建的难题，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: The impedance network (IN) model is gaining popularity in the oscillation
analysis of wind farms. However, the construction of such an IN model requires
impedance curves of each wind turbine under their respective operating
conditions, making its online application difficult due to the transmission of
numerous high-density impedance curves. To address this issue, this paper
proposes an AI-based impedance encoding-decoding method to facilitate the
online construction of IN model. First, an impedance encoder is trained to
compress impedance curves by setting the number of neurons much smaller than
that of frequency points. Then, the compressed data of each turbine are
uploaded to the wind farm and an impedance decoder is trained to reconstruct
original impedance curves. At last, based on the nodal admittance matrix (NAM)
method, the IN model of the wind farm can be obtained. The proposed method is
validated via model training and real-time simulations, demonstrating that the
encoded impedance vectors enable fast transmission and accurate reconstruction
of the original impedance curves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用雷达技术实现无接触、被动式心率监测，但不同雷达系统缺乏标准化，需大量配对数据集。

Method: 采用新型2D+1D ResNet架构，先在FMCW雷达上训练，再迁移到IR-UWB雷达。

Result: FMCW雷达的MAE为0.85 bpm，MAPE为1.42%；迁移学习后IR-UWB雷达的MAE降低25%。

Conclusion: 迁移学习可加速雷达心率监测技术在消费设备中的应用。

Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and
passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones.
However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization
means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar
system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated
continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems,
both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a
continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW
radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3
receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz
bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we
achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119
participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained
performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate
ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model,
trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376,
avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach
yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE
reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning
between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate
its introduction into existing consumer devices.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Differentiating wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is
clinically critical yet challenging due to morphological similarities in
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals between life-threatening ventricular
tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A).
Misdiagnosis carries fatal risks. We propose a computationally efficient deep
learning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide model
interpretability for clinical deployment.
  Methods: A novel lightweight parallel deep architecture is introduced. Each
pipeline processes individual ECG leads using two 1D-CNN blocks to extract
local features. Feature maps are concatenated across leads, followed by LSTM
layers to capture temporal dependencies. Final classification employs fully
connected layers. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) for local/global interpretation. The model was evaluated on a 35-subject
ECG database using standard performance metrics.
  Results: The model achieved $95.63\%$ accuracy ($95\%$ CI: $93.07-98.19\%$),
with sensitivity=$95.10\%$, specificity=$96.06\%$, and F1-score=$95.12\%$. It
outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational
efficiency, requiring minimal CNN blocks per pipeline. SHAP analysis
demonstrated clinically interpretable feature contributions.
  Conclusions: Our end-to-end framework delivers high-precision WCT

enhances clinical trust by elucidating decision logic, supporting rapid,
informed diagnosis. This approach shows significant promise for real-world ECG
analysis tools.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial
for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its
time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets
for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often
overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications,
which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an
incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an
in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark,
which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct
evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics
for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking
state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and
robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model
architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG
signal analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来无线网络中，无人机因其灵活性和高效性在集成感知与通信（ISAC）中具有重要作用，但资源约束和时间紧迫条件下优化轨迹、通信和感知仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）算法，结合卡尔曼滤波和目标状态预测、正则化零干扰技术，以及Soft Actor-Critic算法，优化无人机轨迹和波束成形。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在平均信息新鲜度（AoI）上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了感知精度与通信质量，为无人机-ISAC系统提供了实时决策支持。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in
future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency.
However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication,
and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical
conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age
of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs
target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information
freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI
minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and
beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we
develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of
providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar
sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed
for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to
mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is
applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed
framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and
communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline
approaches.

Motivation: 现有ECG数据集多为单模态或双模态，限制了多模态AI系统的开发。MEETI旨在提供同步的原始信号、图像和文本数据，支持更全面的心血管AI研究。

Conclusion: MEETI为下一代可解释、多模态心血管AI奠定了基础，是研究和评估ECG-AI系统的理想基准。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular
care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and
conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level
performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable
multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of
publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,
diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide
only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to
build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in
real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext
ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw
waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual
interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes
beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering
structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model
interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the
raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature
parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved
using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports
transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable
reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal
analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI
established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable,
multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive
benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.

Conclusion: 空中联邦蒸馏框架在减少通信开销的同时，保持了较高的学习性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to
the development of federated learning (FL). FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to
cooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to
share the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made
existing FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication
overhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated
distillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge
distillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing
the model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,
are shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property
of the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in
over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting
the power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the
intractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex
nature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle
this problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate
in over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'
transmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained
given the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient
approach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite
relaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the
original and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical
results will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a
significant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise
in testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.

Result: 在CHB-MIT数据集上，通道选择后平均灵敏度提升至80.1%，通道数从18降至2.8。

Conclusion: 癫痫无关的数据划分方法对EEG记录丰富的患者更适用，且通道选择显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure
onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However,
wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky
size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel
two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure
prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent
division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data.
Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients
with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was
76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection,
dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of
channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1%
with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the
seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous
seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG
recordings.

Result: 提出了一个材料知识基准，用于判断LLMs在PSPP链中哪些步骤适用，哪些需要专门模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在材料科学中有潜力，但需结合专门模型以弥补其在科学内容生成上的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of
mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish
connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for
step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain
of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately
representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet.
However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be
applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for
their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information
about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of
Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the
uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating
factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads
to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in
the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.

Abstract: Schema matching is essential for integrating heterogeneous data sources and
enhancing dataset discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive
problem. We introduce SCHEMORA, a schema matching framework that combines large
language models with hybrid retrieval techniques in a prompt-based approach,
enabling efficient identification of candidate matches without relying on
labeled training data or exhaustive pairwise comparisons. By enriching schema
metadata and leveraging both vector-based and lexical retrieval, SCHEMORA
improves matching accuracy and scalability. Evaluated on the MIMIC-OMOP
benchmark, it establishes new state-of-the-art performance, with gains of 7.49%
in HitRate@5 and 3.75% in HitRate@3 over previous best results. To our
knowledge, this is the first LLM-based schema matching method with an
open-source implementation, accompanied by analysis that underscores the
critical role of retrieval and provides practical guidance on model selection.

Motivation: 传统拍卖设计假设目标受众可直接接触拍卖者，忽略了经济网络中大量未察觉拍卖的竞标者。本研究旨在扩展最优拍卖理论至整个经济网络。

Method: 采用贝叶斯近似分析，设计了一种适用于代表性网络拍卖的保留价函数，平衡高保留价以增加收入和吸引更多买家以提高销售成功率。

Result: 提出的保留价函数保证了激励兼容性，并为卖家提供了超出Myerson最优拍卖的额外收入。具体而言，在大小为n的网络中，若卖家有ρ个直接邻居，则保留价可保证1−1/ρ的近似比。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络拍卖提供了一种简单且有效的保留价设计方法，适用于任何规模和结构的网络市场。

Abstract: Reserve prices are widely used in practice. The problem of designing
revenue-optimal auctions based on reserve price has drawn much attention in the
auction design community. Although they have been extensively studied, most
developments rely on the significant assumption that the target audience of the
sale is directly reachable by the auctioneer, while a large portion of bidders
in the economic network unaware of the sale are omitted. This work follows the
diffusion auction design, which aims to extend the target audience of optimal
auction theory to all entities in economic networks. We investigate the design
of simple and provably near-optimal network auctions via reserve price. Using
Bayesian approximation analysis, we provide a simple and explicit form of the
reserve price function tailored to the most representative network auction. We
aim to balance setting a sufficiently high reserve price to induce high revenue
in a successful sale, and attracting more buyers from the network to increase
the probability of a successful sale. This reserve price function preserves
incentive compatibility for network auctions, allowing the seller to extract
additional revenue beyond that achieved by the Myerson optimal auction.
Specifically, if the seller has $\rho$ direct neighbours in a network of size
$n$, this reserve price guarantees a $1-{1 \over \rho}$ approximation to the
theoretical upper bound, i.e., the maximum possible revenue from any network of
size $n$. This result holds for any size and any structure of the networked
market.

*Manuel Valle Torre,Thom van der Velden,Marcus Specht,Catharine Oertel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: JELAI是一个开源平台架构，将细粒度学习分析与基于LLM的辅导集成到Jupyter Notebook环境中，支持实时、情境敏感的AI辅导和研究学生行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育支持方面潜力巨大，但缺乏教学基础和学生学习情境的感知能力，且在研究学生与工具的互动方面存在挑战。

Method: JELAI采用模块化、容器化设计，结合JupyterLab扩展和中间件，实现代码交互与聊天数据的集成捕获，支持情境敏感的AI提示和数据分析。

Result: 系统性能基准测试和两个概念验证用例展示了JELAI在多模态数据记录、帮助寻求模式分析和AI配置A/B测试方面的能力。

Conclusion: JELAI的技术框架为研究人员和教育者提供了一个灵活工具，用于在Jupyter生态系统中开发和研究基于学习分析的AI辅导。

Abstract: Generative AI offers potential for educational support, but often lacks
pedagogical grounding and awareness of the student's learning context.
Furthermore, researching student interactions with these tools within authentic
learning environments remains challenging. To address this, we present JELAI,
an open-source platform architecture designed to integrate fine-grained
Learning Analytics (LA) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring directly
within a Jupyter Notebook environment. JELAI employs a modular, containerized
design featuring JupyterLab extensions for telemetry and chat, alongside a
central middleware handling LA processing and context-aware LLM prompt
enrichment. This architecture enables the capture of integrated code
interaction and chat data, facilitating real-time, context-sensitive AI
scaffolding and research into student behaviour. We describe the system's
design, implementation, and demonstrate its feasibility through system
performance benchmarks and two proof-of-concept use cases illustrating its
capabilities for logging multi-modal data, analysing help-seeking patterns, and
supporting A/B testing of AI configurations. JELAI's primary contribution is
its technical framework, providing a flexible tool for researchers and
educators to develop, deploy, and study LA-informed AI tutoring within the
widely used Jupyter ecosystem.

### [466] [Assessing the Reliability of Large Language Models for Deductive Qualitative Coding: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14384)
*Angjelin Hila,Elliott Hauser*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了ChatGPT在结构化演绎定性编码中的应用，发现通过定制干预策略，LLMs可达到高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注归纳编码，而LLMs在演绎分类任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用CAP Master Codebook对最高法院案例进行分类，测试了四种干预方法（零样本、少样本、基于定义、任务分解）。

Result: 任务分解策略表现最佳（准确率0.775），分类行为显著受干预策略影响。

Conclusion: 定制干预策略可使LLMs达到适合严格定性编码的可靠性水平。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs),
specifically ChatGPT, for structured deductive qualitative coding. While most
current research emphasizes inductive coding applications, we address the
underexplored potential of LLMs to perform deductive classification tasks
aligned with established human-coded schemes. Using the Comparative Agendas
Project (CAP) Master Codebook, we classified U.S. Supreme Court case summaries
into 21 major policy domains. We tested four intervention methods: zero-shot,
few-shot, definition-based, and a novel Step-by-Step Task Decomposition
strategy, across repeated samples. Performance was evaluated using standard
classification metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's
alpha), and construct validity was assessed using chi-squared tests and
Cramer's V. Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention
strategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramer's V
values ranging from 0.359 to 0.613, indicating moderate to strong shifts in
classification patterns. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved
the strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746),
achieving thresholds for substantial agreement. Despite the semantic ambiguity
within case summaries, ChatGPT displayed stable agreement across samples,
including high F1 scores in low-support subclasses. These findings demonstrate
that with targeted, custom-tailored interventions, LLMs can achieve reliability
levels suitable for integration into rigorous qualitative coding workflows.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了对话AI在技术面试中“大声思考”练习中的作用，通过实验发现参与者认可AI在模拟、反馈和学习中的作用，并提出了设计建议和更广泛的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术面试中的“大声思考”过程缺乏结构化练习机会，对话AI的潜力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 使用基于LLM的技术面试练习工具，对17名参与者进行研究。

Result: 参与者认可AI在模拟、反馈和学习中的作用，提出了设计建议和更广泛的研究方向。

Conclusion: 对话AI在技术面试练习中具有潜力，需进一步探索人机协作的研究方向。

Abstract: One challenge in technical interviews is the think-aloud process, where
candidates verbalize their thought processes while solving coding tasks.
Despite its importance, opportunities for structured practice remain limited.
Conversational AI offers potential assistance, but limited research explores
user perceptions of its role in think-aloud practice. To address this gap, we
conducted a study with 17 participants using an LLM-based technical interview
practice tool. Participants valued AI's role in simulation, feedback, and
learning from generated examples. Key design recommendations include promoting
social presence in conversational AI for technical interview simulation,
providing feedback beyond verbal content analysis, and enabling crowdsourced
think-aloud examples through human-AI collaboration. Beyond feature design, we
examined broader considerations, including intersectional challenges and
potential strategies to address them, how AI-driven interview preparation could
promote equitable learning in computing careers, and the need to rethink AI's
role in interview practice by suggesting a research direction that integrates
human-AI collaboration.

*Yanming Zhang,Krishnakumar Hegde,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: XplainAct是一个可视化分析框架，支持在子群体中模拟、解释和推理个体水平的干预效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推理方法主要关注群体水平效果，难以处理具有显著异质性的系统。

Method: 提出XplainAct框架，通过两个案例研究（流行病学中的阿片类药物相关死亡和总统选举中的投票倾向）验证其有效性。

Result: XplainAct能够有效支持个体水平的干预分析和推理。

Conclusion: XplainAct为解决异质性系统中的因果推理问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: Causality helps people reason about and understand complex systems,
particularly through what-if analyses that explore how interventions might
alter outcomes. Although existing methods embrace causal reasoning using
interventions and counterfactual analysis, they primarily focus on effects at
the population level. These approaches often fall short in systems
characterized by significant heterogeneity, where the impact of an intervention
can vary widely across subgroups. To address this challenge, we present
XplainAct, a visual analytics framework that supports simulating, explaining,
and reasoning interventions at the individual level within subpopulations. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of XplainAct through two case studies:
investigating opioid-related deaths in epidemiology and analyzing voting
inclinations in the presidential election.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发了一种多模态引导模拟器，帮助盲人和低视力用户在工业仓库中安全远程操作机器人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业仓库环境复杂，盲人和低视力用户远程操作机器人存在高风险，现有研究缺乏针对性的多模态引导设计。

Method: 结合导航网格、实时路径规划和多模态反馈（视觉、听觉、触觉），设计了一个高保真模拟器。

Result: 模拟器提供了实时闭环测试环境，支持快速部署到实际机器人系统。

Conclusion: 该模拟器为无障碍远程操作研究提供了可重复的测试平台，并支持实际仓库中的快速部署。

Abstract: Industrial warehouses are congested with moving forklifts, shelves and
personnel, making robot teleoperation particularly risky and demanding for
blind and low-vision (BLV) operators. Although accessible teleoperation plays a
key role in inclusive workforce participation, systematic research on its use
in industrial environments is limited, and few existing studies barely address
multimodal guidance designed for BLV users. We present a novel multimodal
guidance simulator that enables BLV users to control a mobile robot through a
high-fidelity warehouse environment while simultaneously receiving synchronized
visual, auditory, and haptic feedback. The system combines a navigation mesh
with regular re-planning so routes remain accurate avoiding collisions as
forklifts and human avatars move around the warehouse. Users with low vision
are guided with a visible path line towards destination; navigational voice
cues with clockwise directions announce upcoming turns, and finally
proximity-based haptic feedback notifies the users of static and moving
obstacles in the path. This real-time, closed-loop system offers a repeatable
testbed and algorithmic reference for accessible teleoperation research. The
simulator's design principles can be easily adapted to real robots due to the
alignment of its navigation, speech, and haptic modules with commercial
hardware, supporting rapid feasibility studies and deployment of inclusive
telerobotic tools in actual warehouses.

*Mohammad 'Matt' Namvarpour,Brandon Brofsky,Jessica Medina,Mamtaj Akter,Afsaneh Razi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究分析了青少年对Character.AI等生成式AI聊天机器人的情感依赖问题，发现其可能导致心理困扰和现实生活干扰，并提出改进设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨青少年与可定制人格聊天机器人的互动模式及其潜在负面影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析了318篇由13-17岁青少年在Character.AI子论坛发布的Reddit帖子。

Result: 青少年常因情感支持或创意表达使用聊天机器人，但易形成强烈依赖，影响现实关系和日常活动，且伴随心理困扰。

Conclusion: 建议未来聊天机器人设计应增强自我意识、支持现实互动，并让青少年参与开发更安全的数字工具。

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) driven chatbots like
Character.AI become embedded in adolescent life, they raise concerns about
emotional dependence and digital overreliance. While studies have investigated
the overreliance of adults on these chatbots, they have not investigated teens'
interactions with chatbots with customizable personas. We analyzed 318 Reddit
posts made by users self-reported as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI
subreddit to understand patterns of overreliance. We found teens commonly begin
using chatbots for emotional support or creative expression, but many develop
strong attachments that interfere with offline relationships and daily
routines. Their posts revealed recurring signs of psychological distress,
cycles of relapse, and difficulty disengaging. Teens reported that their
overreliance often ended when they reflect on the harm, return to in-person
social settings, or become frustrated by platform restrictions. Based on the
implications of our findings, we provide recommendations for future chatbot
design so they can promote self-awareness, support real-world engagement, and
involve teens in developing safer digital tools.

experience-driven voltage control solution for distribution networks, which
enables the self-evolution of LLM-based voltage control strategies through the
collaboration and interaction of multiple modules-specifically, experience
storage, experience retrieval, experience generation, and experience
modification. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method and highlight the applicability of LLM in addressing power
system dispatch challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗系统在资源有限环境中的互操作性差、缺乏离线支持和高成本基础设施依赖等问题，提升前线医疗工作者的效率。

Method: 开发了一个基于嵌入式设备的平台，支持AES-256加密本地存储和可选云同步，集成了基于随机森林的贫血筛查模块和YOLOv8n的指甲床检测器。

Result: 贫血筛查模块的测试RMSE为1.969 g/dL，MAE为1.490 g/dL，灵敏度达79.2%。YOLOv8n检测器的推理延迟从46.96 ms降至21.50 ms。

Conclusion: 该系统通过低成本、模块化和数据隐私合规性，为资源有限环境提供了可扩展的数字健康解决方案。

Abstract: The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces
persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support,
and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions
neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health
workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled
Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure
patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on
small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage
with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we
integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor
analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with
KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL
and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To
optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8,
reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5
at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data
privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health
adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to
enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in
underserved regions.

Motivation: 传统方法渲染黑洞引力透镜效应计算量大，效率低，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 训练神经网络拟合黑洞周围时空，生成受引力透镜影响的光线路径。

Result: 验证显示，该方法计算时间减少15倍，能准确渲染多黑洞系统。

Conclusion: 神经网络为复杂天体现象渲染提供了高效新途径。

Abstract: We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with
gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves
training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then
employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by
gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black
holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time
required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our
approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with
superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate
visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time. Our
findings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for
rendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to
astronomical visualization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MeMo的新框架，通过自适应记忆库存储注意力相关信息，以在视觉线索缺失时仍能保持对目标说话者的注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知能力的启发，解决在视觉线索缺失或质量差时AV-TSE系统性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出MeMo框架，包含两个自适应记忆库，用于存储和维持注意力相关信息，适用于实时场景。

Result: 实验结果显示，MeMo框架比基线至少提高了2 dB的SI-SNR。

Conclusion: MeMo框架有效解决了视觉线索缺失时的目标说话者提取问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate a target
speaker's voice from multi-speaker environments by leveraging visual cues as
guidance. However, the performance of AV-TSE systems heavily relies on the
quality of these visual cues. In extreme scenarios where visual cues are
missing or severely degraded, the system may fail to accurately extract the
target speaker. In contrast, humans can maintain attention on a target speaker
even in the absence of explicit auxiliary information. Motivated by such human
cognitive ability, we propose a novel framework called MeMo, which incorporates
two adaptive memory banks to store attention-related information. MeMo is
specifically designed for real-time scenarios: once initial attention is
established, the system maintains attentional momentum over time, even when
visual cues become unavailable. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify
the effectiveness of MeMo. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
framework achieves SI-SNR improvements of at least 2 dB over the corresponding
baseline.

TL;DR: 论文研究了从弱监督到完全无监督的训练设置对去混响模型的影响，仅依赖混响信号和声学模型进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常需要成对的干信号和混响信号数据，但实际中难以获取。

Method: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯公式的序列学习策略，通过深度神经网络从混响输入中估计声学参数和干信号，并使用混响匹配损失进行指导。

Result: 数据效率最高的变体仅需100个混响参数标记样本即可超越无监督基线，展示了该方法在低资源场景下的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在低资源环境下表现优异，为去混响任务提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the outcome of training state-ofthe-art dereverberation
models with supervision settings ranging from weakly-supervised to fully
unsupervised, relying solely on reverberant signals and an acoustic model for
training. Most of the existing deep learning approaches typically require
paired dry and reverberant data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. We
develop instead a sequential learning strategy motivated by a bayesian
formulation of the dereverberation problem, wherein acoustic parameters and dry
signals are estimated from reverberant inputs using deep neural networks,
guided by a reverberation matching loss. Our most data-efficient variant
requires only 100 reverberation-parameter-labelled samples to outperform an
unsupervised baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the
proposed method in low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 语音的时间动态（如节奏、语调和语速）包含独特的说话人身份信息，但现有方法对此利用不足。

Method: 提取上下文相关的时长嵌入，并基于此开发攻击模型，分析说话人验证和语音匿名化系统的潜在漏洞。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在原始和匿名数据上的说话人验证性能显著优于文献中的简单表示方法。

Conclusion: 上下文相关的时长嵌入能有效提升说话人验证性能，揭示了语音匿名化系统的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: The temporal dynamics of speech, encompassing variations in rhythm,
intonation, and speaking rate, contain important and unique information about
speaker identity. This paper proposes a new method for representing speaker
characteristics by extracting context-dependent duration embeddings from speech
temporal dynamics. We develop novel attack models using these representations
and analyze the potential vulnerabilities in speaker verification and voice
anonymization systems.The experimental results show that the developed attack
models provide a significant improvement in speaker verification performance
for both original and anonymized data in comparison with simpler
representations of speech temporal dynamics reported in the literature.

Result: 生成的语音更接近目标说话人，时长建模和表达力得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种印度语言上表现良好，适用于未见说话人的语音生成。

Abstract: We present a speaker conditioned text-to-speech (TTS) system aimed at
addressing challenges in generating speech for unseen speakers and supporting
diverse Indian languages. Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS
architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference
audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To
further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based
duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more
accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely
resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall
expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed
classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near
speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific
speaker-conditioned models. Using the IndicSUPERB dataset for multiple Indian
languages such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Punjabi and
Tamil.

Conclusion: Neuro-MSBG高效且实用，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Hearing loss simulation models are essential for hearing aid deployment.
However, existing models have high computational complexity and latency, which
limits real-time applications and lack direct integration with speech
processing systems. To address these issues, we propose Neuro-MSBG, a
lightweight end-to-end model with a personalized audiogram encoder for
effective time-frequency modeling. Experiments show that Neuro-MSBG supports
parallel inference and retains the intelligibility and perceptual quality of
the original MSBG, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of
0.9247 for Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) and 0.8671 for
Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). Neuro-MSBG reduces simulation
runtime by a factor of 46 (from 0.970 seconds to 0.021 seconds for a 1 second
input), further demonstrating its efficiency and practicality.

TL;DR: 论文研究了通用AI模型的开源定义对开发者和市场的影响，提出了一个模型来分析监管政策如何影响上游模型发布和下游微调行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在监管框架（如欧盟AI法案）下，开源定义模糊对通用AI模型和专用模型开发者策略的影响，为AI治理提供理论支持。

Method: 通过建模通用模型开发者（generalist）和专用任务开发者（specialist）的策略互动，分析不同开源标准和监管惩罚对市场均衡的影响。

Result: 发现模型的基础性能决定了监管惩罚和开源阈值对开发者策略的影响程度，提出了有效的监管措施和开源标准。

Conclusion: 为AI治理中的开源政策提供了理论基础，有助于评估和优化实际政策设计。

Abstract: Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, encourage openness of
general-purpose AI models by offering legal exemptions for "open-source"
models. Despite this legislative attention on openness, the definition of
open-source foundation models remains ambiguous. This paper models the
strategic interactions among the creator of a general-purpose model (the
generalist) and the entity that fine-tunes the general-purpose model to a
specialized domain or task (the specialist), in response to regulatory
requirements on model openness. We present a stylized model of the regulator's
choice of an open-source definition to evaluate which AI openness standards
will establish appropriate economic incentives for developers. Our results
characterize market equilibria -- specifically, upstream model release
decisions and downstream fine-tuning efforts -- under various openness
regulations and present a range of effective regulatory penalties and
open-source thresholds. Overall, we find the model's baseline performance
determines when increasing the regulatory penalty vs. the open-source threshold
will significantly alter the generalist's release strategy. Our model provides
a theoretical foundation for AI governance decisions around openness and
enables evaluation and refinement of practical open-source policies.

Motivation: 解决网络拍卖中缺乏通用分配规则的问题，填补现有研究在策略证明性上的不足。

Method: 提出两种单调分配规则（ID-MON和IP-MON），并分析其策略证明支付规则的存在性和计算可行性。

Result: 证明了在这些规则下存在策略证明的支付规则，且收入最大化的支付规则是可计算的。

Conclusion: 解决了单需求组合网络拍卖的障碍，为网络拍卖提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Strategyproofness in network auctions requires that bidders not only report
their valuations truthfully, but also do their best to invite neighbours from
the social network. In contrast to canonical auctions, where the value-monotone
allocation in Myerson's Lemma is a cornerstone, a general principle of
allocation rules for strategyproof network auctions is still missing. We show
that, due to the absence of such a principle, even extensions to multi-unit
network auctions with single-unit demand present unexpected difficulties, and
all pioneering researches fail to be strategyproof. For the first time in this
field, we identify two categories of monotone allocation rules on networks:
Invitation-Depressed Monotonicity (ID-MON) and Invitation-Promoted Monotonicity
(IP-MON). They encompass all existing allocation rules of network auctions as
specific instances. For any given ID-MON or IP-MON allocation rule, we
characterize the existence and sufficient conditions for the strategyproof
payment rules, and show that among all such payment rules, the
revenue-maximizing one exists and is computationally feasible. With these
results, the obstacle of combinatorial network auction with single-minded
bidders is now resolved.

Result: 证明了PMMS与EFX的分离，并在三种特殊情况下提供了公平分配的存在性证明和多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 论文填补了EFX和PMMS的理论空白，为公平分配问题提供了新的见解和实用算法。

Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible items and provide new insights into
the EFX problem, which is widely regarded as the central open question in fair
division, and the PMMS problem, a strictly stronger variant of EFX. Our first
result constructs a three-agent instance with two monotone valuations and one
additive valuation in which no PMMS allocation exists. Since EFX allocations
are known to exist under these assumptions, this establishes a formal
separation between EFX and PMMS.
  We prove existence of fair allocations for three important special cases. We
show that EFX allocations exist for personalized bivalued valuations, where for
each agent $i$ there exist values $a_i > b_i$ such that agent $i$ assigns value
$v_i(\{g\}) \in \{a_i, b_i\}$ to each good $g$. We establish an analogous
existence result for PMMS allocations when $a_i$ is divisible by $b_i$. We also
prove that PMMS allocations exist for binary-valued MMS-feasible valuations,
where each bundle $S$ has value $v_i(S) \in \{0, 1\}$. Notably, this result
holds even without assuming monotonicity of valuations and thus applies to the
fair division of chores and mixed manna. Finally, we study a class of
valuations called pair-demand valuations, which extend the well-studied
unit-demand valuations to the case where each agent derives value from at most
two items, and we show that PMMS allocations exist in this setting. Our proofs
are constructive, and we provide polynomial-time algorithms for all three
existence results.

Method: 提出了一种结构化的多阶段总结框架，分析发言者属性（如发言顺序或政治立场）对总结内容的影响。

Result: 实验发现LLM存在位置和党派偏见，某些发言者被低估或错误归因，分层方法能有效减少差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在民主应用中部署LLM时需要领域敏感的评估指标和伦理监督。

Abstract: The automated summarisation of parliamentary debates using large language
models (LLMs) offers a promising way to make complex legislative discourse more
accessible to the public. However, such summaries must not only be accurate and
concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all
speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from
the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational
biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage
summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity,
while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as
speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and
accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments
using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent
positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically
under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary
by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the
greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for
domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of
LLMs for democratic applications.

TL;DR: AI加剧认知分层，强化技术权力，削弱民主审议能力，需通过教育重建理性自主。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何通过认知分层和技术权力重塑社会结构，削弱民主审议能力。

Method: 结合形式认识论、政治理论、算法架构和经济激励结构，分析AI对认知能力的影响。

Result: AI系统选择性增强部分人的推理能力，同时通过优化界面削弱其他人的认知能力，导致技术权力重新分配。

Conclusion: 需通过教育重建理性自主，将其作为公民义务，并通过认知基础设施保护。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an
accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising
informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal
epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic
incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems
selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with
recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst
simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised
interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and
procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a
technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital
alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of
epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the
substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued.
Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the
erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic
regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy
as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and
structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI（尤其是ChatGPT和深度伪造技术）带来的公平问题和错误信息传播，并提出了减少危害的合作框架和政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术的快速发展（如ChatGPT）带来了自动化优势，但也引发了公平和错误信息等风险，需要深入理解并应对。

Method: 通过分析学术资料，研究AI在医疗、教育、科学等领域的负面影响及其原因。

Result: 揭示了AI技术可能导致的公平问题和错误信息传播，并提出了多方面的合作框架。

Conclusion: 建议用户、开发者和政府共同制定未来政策，以平衡创新与风险控制。

Abstract: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new field, recent developments,
especially with the release of generative tools like ChatGPT, have brought it
to the forefront of the minds of industry workers and academic folk alike.
There is currently much talk about AI and its ability to reshape many everyday
processes as we know them through automation. It also allows users to expand
their ideas by suggesting things they may not have thought of on their own and
provides easier access to information. However, not all of the changes this
technology will bring or has brought so far are positive; this is why it is
extremely important for all modern people to recognize and understand the risks
before using these tools and allowing them to cause harm. This work takes a
position on better understanding many equity concerns and the spread of
misinformation that result from new AI, in this case, specifically ChatGPT and
deepfakes, and encouraging collaboration with law enforcement, developers, and
users to reduce harm. Considering many academic sources, it warns against these
issues, analyzing their cause and impact in fields including healthcare,
education, science, academia, retail, and finance. Lastly, we propose a set of
future-facing guidelines and policy considerations to solve these issues while
still enabling innovation in these fields, this responsibility falling upon
users, developers, and government entities.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合MOOCs、智能教学和AI增强学习的三层教学框架，旨在解决传统教育中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MOOCs、智能教学和AI增强学习在孤立实施中的局限性，提出统一的教学视角。

Method: 提出三层教学框架，结合MOOCs的可扩展性、智能教学的实时响应性和AI的适应性，并通过项目课程设计验证可行性。

Result: 框架能提升学习者参与度、支持教师，并实现个性化且可扩展的学习。

Conclusion: 统一框架能有效整合三种教学范式的优势，为未来教育提供新方向。

Abstract: Over the past decade, higher education has evolved through three distinct
paradigms: the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the
integration of Smart Teaching technologies into classrooms, and the rise of
AI-enhanced learning. Each paradigm is intended to address specific challenges
in traditional education: MOOCs enable ubiquitous access to learning resources;
Smart Teaching supports real-time interaction with data-driven insights; and
generative AI offers personalized feedback and on-demand content generation.
However, these paradigms are often implemented in isolation due to their
disparate technological origins and policy-driven adoption. This paper examines
the origins, strengths, and limitations of each paradigm, and advocates a
unified pedagogical perspective that synthesizes their complementary
affordances. We propose a three-layer instructional framework that combines the
scalability of MOOCs, the responsiveness of Smart Teaching, and the adaptivity
of AI. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present a curriculum design for a
project-based course. The findings highlight the framework's potential to
enhance learner engagement, support instructors, and enable personalized yet
scalable learning.

Motivation: 脑基础模型与脑机接口结合可能带来革命性应用，但也存在前所未有的风险，如神经信号被滥用和认知自由被侵蚀。用户难以控制或观察其神经信号的处理方式，导致权力不对称。

Method: 结合法律传统和AI对齐技术，提出可实施的架构和治理机制，将信托责任直接嵌入脑基础模型的技术设计中。

Result: 通过技术设计确保脑基础模型以用户最佳利益为导向，减少权力不对称和潜在滥用。

Conclusion: 将脑基础模型置于信托责任框架下，是实现其潜力同时保护用户自主权的关键。

Abstract: Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing
text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI,
and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled
devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in
milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including
the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive
liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are
interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation.
This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and
confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through
technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI
alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance
mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain
foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their
potential without compromising self-determination.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM生成内容中对边缘群体（如同性恋群体）的刻板印象和局限性表现，并提出了相关假设进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示LLM在生成内容中对边缘群体的不充分和刻板化表现，以及这种表现对社会话语的影响。

Method: 通过分析LLM生成的关于同性恋群体的内容，识别出有害表现、狭隘表现和话语他者化现象，并设计假设进行验证。

Result: 结果显示，LLM在描绘同性恋角色时表现显著受限。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM在生成内容中对边缘群体的表现存在局限性，需进一步改进以减少刻板印象。

Abstract: One way social groups are marginalized in discourse is that the narratives
told about them often default to a narrow, stereotyped range of topics. In
contrast, default groups are allowed the full complexity of human existence. We
describe the constrained representations of queer people in LLM generations in
terms of harmful representations, narrow representations, and discursive
othering and formulate hypotheses to test for these phenomena. Our results show
that LLMs are significantly limited in their portrayals of queer personas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在流行病学任务中的潜力，识别效率提升领域和现有限制。

Method: 通过现有数据集映射流行病学任务，评估AI工具的效率增益。

Result: AI在编码和行政任务中提升效率，但受限于模型缺陷（如文献综述中的幻觉）和人为系统障碍。

Conclusion: AI与流行病学需双向合作，实证测试和基准化AI系统以实现其潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) - particularly generative AI
- present new opportunities to accelerate, or even automate, epidemiological
research. Unlike disciplines based on physical experimentation, a sizable
fraction of Epidemiology relies on secondary data analysis and thus is
well-suited for such augmentation. Yet, it remains unclear which specific tasks
can benefit from AI interventions or where roadblocks exist. Awareness of
current AI capabilities is also mixed. Here, we map the landscape of
epidemiological tasks using existing datasets - from literature review to data
access, analysis, writing up, and dissemination - and identify where existing
AI tools offer efficiency gains. While AI can increase productivity in some
areas such as coding and administrative tasks, its utility is constrained by
limitations of existing AI models (e.g. hallucinations in literature reviews)
and human systems (e.g. barriers to accessing datasets). Through examples of
AI-generated epidemiological outputs, including fully AI-generated papers, we
demonstrate that recently developed agentic systems can now design and execute
epidemiological analysis, albeit to varied quality (see
https://github.com/edlowther/automated-epidemiology). Epidemiologists have new
opportunities to empirically test and benchmark AI systems; realising the
potential of AI will require two-way engagement between epidemiologists and
engineers.

TL;DR: 论文通过联合实验揭示大型语言模型（LLMs）评估经济政策的主要因素，发现其对失业、不平等、金融稳定和环境危害最敏感，而对经济增长、通胀和政府债务等传统宏观经济问题较不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在经济政策评估中的隐含假设，填补其作为黑箱的认知空白。

Method: 采用联合实验方法，分析LLMs对不同经济政策因素的敏感性。

Result: LLMs对失业、不平等、金融稳定和环境危害高度敏感，而对传统宏观经济指标（如增长、通胀、债务）反应较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs的经济政策评估偏好与传统经济学关注点存在显著差异，需进一步研究其影响。

Abstract: How does AI think about economic policy? While the use of large language
models (LLMs) in economics is growing exponentially, their assumptions on
economic issues remain a black box. This paper uses a conjoint experiment to
tease out the main factors influencing LLMs' evaluation of economic policy. It
finds that LLMs are most sensitive to unemployment, inequality, financial
stability, and environmental harm and less sensitive to traditional
macroeconomic concerns such as economic growth, inflation, and government debt.
The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across models.
