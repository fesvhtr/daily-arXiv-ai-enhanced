TL;DR: DigitalShadow是一个基于面部基础模型的CAD早期预警系统，通过无接触方式从视频流中提取面部特征，生成个性化风险评估报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球人口老龄化加剧了医疗系统压力，CAD是主要死因之一，早期检测和管理至关重要。

Method: 系统预训练2100万张面部图像，并微调为LiveCAD模型，使用7004张来自1751名中国患者的图像进行CAD风险评估。

Conclusion: DigitalShadow为CAD早期检测提供了高效、隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for
CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained
on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a
specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751
subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and
contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without
requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it
generates natural language risk reports and individualized health
recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow
supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

### [2] [Exploring Adversarial Watermarking in Transformer-Based Models: Transferability and Robustness Against Defense Mechanism for Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06389)
*Rifat Sadik,Tanvir Rahman,Arpan Bhattacharjee,Bikash Chandra Halder,Ismail Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于Transformer的视觉模型（ViTs）在医学图像中对对抗性水印攻击的脆弱性，并通过对抗训练提高了其鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer模型在计算机视觉任务中的成功应用，研究其在医学图像分析中的对抗性脆弱性具有重要意义。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降（PGD）生成对抗性水印，测试ViTs的脆弱性，并分析对抗训练的效果。

Result: ViTs对对抗性攻击非常脆弱（准确率降至27.6%），但对抗训练能显著提升性能（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像中易受对抗性攻击，但对抗训练是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

### [3] [From Swath to Full-Disc: Advancing Precipitation Retrieval with Multimodal Knowledge Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07050)
*Zheng Wang,Kai Ying,Bin Xu,Chunjiao Wang,Cong Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PRE-Net的两阶段模型，通过多模态知识扩展技术，提高了基于红外数据的全圆盘降水反演精度，超越了现有领先产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外降水反演算法精度低，而被动微波和雷达方法虽准确但覆盖范围有限，因此需要开发一种更准确且覆盖范围更广的红外降水反演方法。

Method: 采用两阶段管道：1) 扫描带蒸馏阶段，通过协调掩蔽和小波增强（CoMWE）将多模态数据知识迁移到红外模型；2) 全圆盘适应阶段，通过Self-MaskTune平衡多模态和红外知识。

Result: PRE-Net在PRE基准测试中显著提升了降水反演性能，优于PERSIANN-CCS、PDIR和IMERG等领先产品。

Conclusion: PRE-Net通过多模态知识扩展技术，成功实现了高精度的全圆盘红外降水反演，为实时降水监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

### [4] [(LiFT) Lightweight Fitness Transformer: A language-vision model for Remote Monitoring of Physical Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06480)
*A. Postlmayr,P. Cosman,S. Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB智能手机摄像头的远程健身追踪系统，解决了现有方法在运动多样性和实际部署中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健身追踪模型要么运动种类有限，要么过于复杂难以部署，缺乏通用性。

Method: 开发了一个多任务运动分析模型，结合大规模健身数据集Olympia（涵盖1900多种运动），利用视觉-语言模型进行运动检测和重复计数。

Result: 模型在Olympia数据集上运动检测准确率为76.5%，重复计数准确率为85.3%。

Conclusion: 通过单一视觉-语言模型实现运动识别和计数，推动了AI健身追踪的普及。

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

### [5] [Learning Compact Vision Tokens for Efficient Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07138)
*Hao Tang,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间令牌融合（STF）和多块令牌融合（MBTF）方法，以减少视觉令牌序列长度并提升推理效率，同时保持多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）因计算成本高和视觉令牌序列处理复杂度高而面临挑战，需要一种方法来减少令牌数量并提升效率。

Method: 通过STF融合空间相邻令牌以减少序列长度，并通过MBTF补充多粒度特征以保持信息完整性。

Result: 在8个流行视觉语言基准测试中，仅使用基线25%的视觉令牌即达到可比或更优性能。

Conclusion: STF和MBTF模块有效平衡了令牌减少与信息保留，显著提升了推理效率且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The
source code and trained weights are available at

### [6] [GS4: Generalizable Sparse Splatting Semantic SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06517)
*Mingqi Jiang,Chanho Kim,Chen Ziwen,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯泼溅（GS）的通用语义SLAM算法，通过学习网络增量构建3D场景表示，解决了现有GS方法依赖场景优化且泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM算法生成的地图分辨率低且不完整，而现有GS方法依赖场景优化且泛化性差，需要一种更高效的通用解决方案。

Method: 使用RGB-D图像识别主干网络预测高斯参数，集成3D语义分割，并通过全局定位后仅优化1次高斯泼溅来修正定位漂移。

Result: 在ScanNet上实现了最先进的语义SLAM性能，高斯数量比其他GS方法少一个数量级，并在NYUv2和TUM RGB-D数据集上展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过通用网络和高效优化策略，显著提升了GS在语义SLAM中的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视听分割框架，利用预训练模型实现无需任务特定训练的高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大规模像素级标注，成本高且耗时，因此提出无需标注的零样本方法。

Method: 整合音频、视觉和文本表征，通过预训练模型连接策略消除模态差异。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现零样本SOTA性能，验证了多模态模型整合的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态预训练模型整合为零样本视听分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL-VAE训练中常见的伪影（如色彩偏移、网格模式等）影响重建和生成质量，需要一种无需大幅架构改动的方法来解决。

Method: 提出VIVAT方法，通过调整损失权重、优化填充策略和引入空间条件归一化，系统性解决五种常见伪影。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VIVAT在图像重建（PSNR和SSIM）和文本到图像生成（CLIP分数）方面达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VIVAT为优化VAE训练提供了实用且高效的解决方案，同时保持了KL-VAE框架的简洁性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

### [9] [Securing Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06563)
*Thushari Hapuarachchi,Long Dang,Kaiqi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了用于交通标志识别的深度神经网络（DNNs）的鲁棒性，提出了一种基于数据增强的训练方法以抵御误差最小化攻击，并开发了一个检测模型来识别被污染的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNNs在交通标志识别中的广泛应用，且训练数据来源未知，确保模型安全性和防止训练过程中的数据污染至关重要。

Method: 论文首先通过向训练数据添加微小扰动实施误差最小化攻击，然后提出一种基于非线性变换的数据增强训练方法以提高模型鲁棒性。此外，还开发了一个检测模型来识别被污染的数据。

Result: 误差最小化攻击将DNNs的预测准确率从99.90%降至10.6%，而提出的缓解方案将准确率恢复至96.05%。检测模型在识别攻击时的成功率超过99%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，交通标志识别系统需要采用先进的训练方法以抵御数据污染攻击，并验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

### [10] [Textile Analysis for Recycling Automation using Transfer Learning and Zero-Shot Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06569)
*Yannis Spyridis,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用RGB图像和深度学习技术（如迁移学习和基础模型）实现纺织品自动分类和污染物分割的可行性，展示了高效且低成本的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纺织品回收中准确识别材料成分和检测污染物是挑战，需要高效且低成本的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用RGB图像，结合迁移学习（EfficientNetB0）进行分类，以及零样本方法（Grounding DINO + SAM）进行分割。

Result: 分类准确率达81.25%，分割任务mIoU为0.90，表现优异。

Conclusion: RGB图像结合现代深度学习技术可用于纺织品回收的关键预处理任务，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

### [11] [A Deep Learning Approach for Facial Attribute Manipulation and Reconstruction in Surveillance and Reconnaissance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06578)
*Anees Nashath Shaik,Barbara Villarini,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据驱动平台，通过生成合成训练数据来解决现有AI面部识别模型中的偏见和数据不足问题，提升监控系统的准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监控系统因低质量图像和视频导致面部识别准确性下降，且AI模型存在肤色和遮挡偏见，限制了其在多样化场景中的应用。

Method: 利用基于深度学习的面部属性操纵和重建技术（如自动编码器和GANs）生成多样化高质量面部数据集，并集成图像增强模块提升监控视频中低分辨率或遮挡面部的清晰度。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的评估表明，该平台显著提升了训练数据的多样性和模型公平性。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于减少AI面部分析的偏见，提升监控系统在复杂环境中的准确性和可靠性，推动更公平的安全应用。

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EV-LayerSegNet是一种自监督CNN，用于事件相机的运动分割，通过分层场景动态表示学习光流和分割掩码，并以去模糊质量作为自监督损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在运动任务中表现优异，但获取其训练数据的真实标注成本高且困难，因此需要自监督方法。

Method: 提出EV-LayerSegNet，通过分层动态表示分别学习仿射光流和分割掩码，并利用它们对输入事件去模糊，以去模糊质量作为自监督损失。

Result: 在仅含仿射运动的模拟数据集上训练和测试，IoU和检测率分别达到71%和87%。

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet通过自监督方法有效解决了事件相机运动分割的训练数据标注难题，并在模拟数据上取得了良好性能。

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RARL的框架，通过强化学习增强医学视觉语言模型的推理能力，同时保持高效和适应低资源环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言模型在泛化性、透明性和计算效率方面存在局限，阻碍了其在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 使用低秩适应和自定义奖励函数对轻量级基础模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct进行微调，结合诊断准确性和推理质量。

Result: RARL在医学图像分析和临床推理任务中显著优于监督微调，推理任务性能提升约7.78%，并在未见数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 推理引导学习和推理提示能有效提升医学视觉语言模型的透明性、准确性和资源效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

Conclusion: 有效的CIR需要多模态融合、排名感知目标和高质量负样本，Retrieval-DPO因设计缺陷未能实现预期效果。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

TL;DR: PhysLab是一个针对复杂物理实验的视频数据集，填补了现有数据集在标注粒度、领域覆盖和程序指导方面的不足，支持多种视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在细粒度场景理解、教育领域覆盖和结构化任务过程表示方面存在不足，限制了视觉解析的进展。

Method: 引入PhysLab数据集，包含620个长视频和多级标注，涵盖四种代表性实验，支持动作识别、物体检测和HOI分析等任务。

Result: 建立了强基线并进行了广泛评估，突出了解析教育视频中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: PhysLab有望推动细粒度视觉解析、智能课堂系统的发展，并促进计算机视觉与教育技术的融合。

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at

TL;DR: 利用暗通道作为补充线索，从单张空间变异散焦模糊图像中估计场景深度，通过对抗训练实现端到端深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度估计方法通常依赖多张图像，而单张散焦图像深度估计问题约束不足，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用局部散焦模糊与对比度变化的关系作为深度线索，结合暗通道先验，通过对抗训练实现端到端深度估计。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，暗通道先验的引入显著提升了单张散焦图像深度估计的效果。

Conclusion: 暗通道先验在单张散焦图像深度估计中具有有效性，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在稀疏单目输入下优化耗时长、泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出UV对齐的潜在身份图和分离的多头U-Net，分别编码特定对象的几何与外观，并分解高斯属性。

Result: PGHM显著提升了效率，仅需约20分钟即可生成视觉质量相当的虚拟人。

Conclusion: PGHM在单目虚拟人创建中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flood-DamageSense是一种深度学习框架，专门用于建筑物级别的洪水损害评估，融合多模态数据并引入长期洪水风险层，显著提升了损害分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在洪水损害分类中表现不佳，尤其是当损害特征不明显时。Flood-DamageSense旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 模型结合SAR/InSAR数据、高分辨率光学底图和洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构，联合预测损害状态、洪水范围和建筑物轮廓。

Result: 在Hurricane Harvey数据上，模型比现有基线平均F1分数提升19个百分点，尤其在“轻微”和“中等”损害类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR的全天候能力，提供了更快、更精细的洪水损害情报，支持灾后决策。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation
metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly
updated. Project page: https://github.com/nqian1/Survey-on-ODISR-and-ODVSR.

Motivation: 解决传统抛物线平均曲率流驱动的主动轮廓模型（PMCF-ACMs）对初始曲线配置依赖性强的问题。

Method: 提出HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs，利用可调初始速度场和边缘感知力调制，优化加权四阶Runge-Kutta算法求解波动方程。

Result: HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs在分割精度、抗噪性和数值稳定性上表现更优。

Conclusion: HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs通过自适应初始配置，显著提升了图像分割性能。

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

Motivation: 解决人类与野生动物冲突需要准确识别潜在威胁个体，但现有分类模型在未知类别上表现不佳，需改进OOD检测能力。

Method: 采用参数化的最近类均值（NCM）和非参数化的对比学习方法作为基线，结合预训练特征，并与文献中其他OOD方法对比。

Result: 特征基方法表现更优，NCM结合ImageNet预训练特征在AUPR-IN、AUPR-OUT和AUTC上分别提升2%、4%和22%。

Conclusion: 特征基方法在野生动物OOD检测中具有更强的泛化能力，为缓解人兽冲突提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉和语言融合方面取得了成功，但仍存在输出与图像内容不符的幻觉问题。

Method: 引入LPS解码方法，利用局部视觉先验信息作为值函数来修正解码过程。

Result: 在广泛使用的幻觉基准测试和噪声数据上，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LPS是一种简单、无需训练且高效的方法，能有效抑制多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习旋转轨迹的潜在动态系统，适用于复杂场景下的长期预测。

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的无训练框架，用于在风格化图像合成中保持身份信息，特别适用于小面部或远距离拍摄的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格迁移技术在保持身份信息和高品质风格化之间存在矛盾，尤其是在面部较小或拍摄距离较远的图像中表现不佳。

Method: 采用"马赛克恢复内容图像"技术和无训练内容一致性损失，增强身份保留和内容细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高风格保真度和身份完整性方面显著优于基线模型，且无需重新训练或微调。

Conclusion: 该方法为身份保留的风格化图像合成提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

TL;DR: RDVP-MSD是一种无需训练的自适应框架，通过多模态逐步分解思维链（MSD-CoT）和区域约束双流视觉提示（RDVP），解决了伪装物体分割中的语义模糊和空间分离问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的任务通用提示分割方法在伪装物体分割（COS）中存在语义模糊和空间分离问题，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 提出RDVP-MSD框架，结合MSD-CoT消除语义模糊，RDVP注入空间约束并独立采样前景和背景点。

Result: 在多个COS基准测试中达到最先进的分割效果，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: RDVP-MSD显著提升了分割的准确性和效率，无需训练或监督。

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS模型依赖2D基础模型，导致视图不一致和语义层次理解不足。

Method: 通过构建3D分层语义树和引入实例及部分对比损失，实现视图一致的3D语义表示。

Result: 实验表明Hi-LSplat在3D开放词汇分割和定位中表现优越，尤其在分层语义数据集上。

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat能够有效捕捉3D场景中的复杂分层语义，解决了视图不一致和语义层次问题。

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Motivation: 研究VP在鲁棒源模型下的表现，探索其是否能继承鲁棒性及是否存在鲁棒性与泛化能力的权衡问题。

Method: 提出PBL策略，作为一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，与VP兼容，旨在平衡鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明PBL能有效继承源模型的鲁棒性，并显著提升VP在下游任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PBL解决了VP在鲁棒源模型下的局限性，为VP的实际应用提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Motivation: 解决多图像生成中背景耦合与对象灵活性的平衡问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在背景耦合、文本对齐和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了背景耦合与对象灵活性的平衡，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的两阶段时间序列异常检测方法，显著提升了检测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏视觉-时间推理能力，无法像人类专家一样识别上下文异常。

Method: 提出ViT4TS和VLM4TS两阶段方法，分别用于候选异常定位和基于VLM的精细化检测。

Result: VLM4TS在未进行时间序列训练的情况下，F1-max分数比最佳基线提高24.6%，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，展示了VLM在时间序列异常检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

Conclusion: 神经网络可以替代传统方法，实现与先进融合滤波器相当的姿态估计效果。

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于位置预测的自监督学习方法（LOCA），用于多模态卫星图像的语义分割，显著优于现有的基于重建的自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像的语义分割对地球观测应用至关重要，但受限于标记训练数据的不足。现有自监督预训练方法（如MAE）侧重于重建而非定位，而定位是分割任务的基础。

Method: 通过扩展SatMAE的通道分组方法，处理多模态数据，并引入同组注意力掩码以促进跨模态交互。利用相对补丁位置预测任务，鼓励空间推理而非重建。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11洪水映射数据集上，该方法显著优于现有的基于重建的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对多模态卫星图像的位置预测任务能学习到更适合语义分割的表示，优于基于重建的方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

Conclusion: 仅解码器模型在轨迹预测中具有优势，未来可进一步优化其应用场景。

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL克服了传统强化学习方法的局限性，为多模态大语言模型的视觉推理研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合去噪与识别，显著提升了噪声环境下的3D人脸识别性能。

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

TL;DR: KNN-Defense是一种轻量级防御策略，通过特征空间的最近邻搜索恢复受扰动的3D点云数据，显著提升对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在3D点云数据分析中表现出色，但对对抗攻击（如点丢弃、移动和添加）的脆弱性威胁了3D视觉系统的可靠性。

Method: KNN-Defense基于流形假设和特征空间的最近邻搜索，利用训练集中邻近样本的语义相似性恢复受扰动的输入。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，KNN-Defense显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，尤其在点丢弃攻击下，对多种模型的准确率提升明显。

Conclusion: KNN-Defense为增强3D点云分类器的对抗鲁棒性提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at
https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态场景适应机制和关键帧管理机制，用于解决3D高斯泼溅技术在长期动态场景中的局限性，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯泼溅技术在静态场景中表现优异，但在长期动态场景（如场景在视野外变化）中表现不足，需要一种机制来持续更新3D表示并保持几何和语义一致性。

Method: 提出了动态场景适应机制以持续更新3D表示，并设计了一种关键帧管理机制，丢弃过时观测同时保留尽可能多的信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法（GaME）比现有技术更准确。

Conclusion: GaME通过动态适应和关键帧管理，有效解决了长期动态场景的挑战，提升了3D高斯泼溅技术的性能。

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用ImageBind多模态嵌入深度学习模型，结合压力敏感垫（PSM）和双通道眼电图（EOG）信号进行睡眠阶段分类的新方法，显著提高了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多导睡眠图（PSG）依赖脑电图（EEG）作为金标准，但其复杂性和对专业设备的需求限制了家庭睡眠监测的普及。因此，研究探索了使用EOG和PSM作为更便捷的替代方案。

Method: 研究引入ImageBind模型，整合PSM数据和双通道EOG信号进行睡眠阶段分类，并首次将PSM和EOG数据融合应用于此任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过微调的ImageBind模型显著优于基于单通道EOG（DeepSleepNet）、仅PSM数据（ViViT）和其他多模态深度学习方法（MBT）的模型，且在未微调时也表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，预训练的多模态嵌入模型（即使最初为非医疗领域设计）可有效用于睡眠阶段分类，其准确性接近依赖复杂EEG数据的系统。

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Motivation: 解决智能眼镜在低光和高动态场景下因运动模糊和帧相机动态范围限制导致的文本识别困难，同时减少带宽和功耗。

Method: 利用用户眼动聚焦事件流，结合深度二元重建和合成数据训练，采用多模态LLM进行OCR。

Result: 在低光环境下成功读取文本，带宽消耗比传统RGB相机低2400倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在低光和高动态场景中表现优异，显著降低带宽需求，适用于智能眼镜。

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Video LLMs在时间推理上的表现，以及视频训练的有效性。

Method: 使用LongVU算法训练LLMs，并在TVBench基准上测试时间推理能力；引入基于标注图像序列的简单微调方案。

Result: 图像训练的LLMs在时间推理上表现显著高于随机水平，接近甚至超过视频训练的LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前视频训练方案未充分利用时间特征，需进一步研究图像训练LLMs的时间推理机制及视频训练的瓶颈。

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

TL;DR: PHiM是一种新型状态空间模型架构，专为极坐标流式LiDAR设计，通过局部双向Mamba块和全局前向Mamba块实现高效检测，性能优于现有流式检测器10%，且吞吐量翻倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐的实时感知，但传统LiDAR处理方法存在延迟问题，而流式方法因卷积与极坐标几何不匹配导致性能下降或复杂度增加。

Method: PHiM采用局部双向Mamba块进行扇区内空间编码，全局前向Mamba块进行扇区间时序建模，避免了卷积和位置编码，实现了失真感知的维度分解操作。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上，PHiM性能优于现有最佳流式检测器10%，且吞吐量翻倍，与全扫描基线相当。

Conclusion: PHiM为极坐标流式LiDAR提供了一种高效、高性能的解决方案，显著提升了实时感知能力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be

Result: 在理解任务中表现优异，生成质量与现有模型相当，推理速度快6倍。

Conclusion: LaTtE-Flow在性能和效率上均有显著提升，适用于实时或资源受限场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在模拟数据集上表现良好，但在真实场景（如文档扫描）中泛化能力不足，因此需要一种针对特定任务优化的超分辨率方法。

Result: 在模拟和真实文档数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了文本检测的IoU指标，同时保持了图像的整体保真度。

Conclusion: 多目标优化在超分辨率模型中具有重要价值，有助于缩小模拟训练与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有图像生成方法通常基于静态检索，容易导致过度复制或风格偏差，AR-RAG旨在通过动态检索提升生成质量和适应性。

Method: 提出了两种框架：DAiD（无需训练的解码策略）和FAiD（参数高效微调方法），分别通过分布增强和特征增强优化生成过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如Midjourney-30K、GenEval和DPG-Bench）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AR-RAG通过动态检索和增强策略显著提升了图像生成的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

Result: 实验证明数据集和融合策略有效，但序列到序列模型难以从双视角视频中学习互补特征。

Conclusion: 双视角数据集和融合策略显著提升了孤立手语识别性能，但互补特征学习仍具挑战。

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

Result: 实验显示MAPLE在细粒度跨模态检索中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过细粒度对齐机制有效缩小模态鸿沟，提升跨模态语义区分能力。

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Conclusion: COGO通过优化共性信息和抑制个性信息，为提升对抗样本迁移性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as
a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera
super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching.
To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合BEV和稀疏点表示的新方法BePo，用于3D占用预测，解决了现有方法在小物体和平坦表面上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法计算成本高，BEV对小物体信息损失严重，稀疏点对平坦表面效率低。

Method: 采用双分支设计：稀疏点分支和BEV分支，通过交叉注意力共享信息，最终融合输出。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: BePo有效结合BEV和稀疏点的优势，提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Conclusion: UNO框架在多样化场景中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,
platforms, and motion patterns. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有视频问答基准局限于单视频查询，无法满足实际应用中大规模音频-视觉检索和推理的需求。

Method: 提出AV-HaystacksQA任务和AVHaystacks基准，包含3100个标注QA对；设计多智能体框架MAGNET，并引入STEM和MTGS评价指标。

Result: MAGNET在BLEU@4和GPT评分上分别比基线方法提升了89%和65%。

Conclusion: AVHaystacks和MAGNET为多视频检索和时序定位提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，用于检测AI生成图像并提供可解释的视觉定位和文本解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法多为黑箱，缺乏可解释性，而MLLMs虽具备分析能力，但在视觉解释与人类推理对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 构建带标注的AI生成图像数据集，并通过多阶段优化策略微调MLLMs，以平衡检测准确性、视觉定位和文本解释。

Result: 模型在检测AI生成图像和定位视觉缺陷方面表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为可解释的AI图像检测提供了有效解决方案，并展示了MLLMs在视觉-文本推理中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练教师网络，计算成本高且不适用于资源受限设备。LSSKD旨在通过自监督知识蒸馏提升模型性能，同时保持轻量化设计。

Method: 在中间特征图上添加辅助分类器，生成多样化的自监督知识，实现不同网络阶段的一对一知识迁移。

Conclusion: LSSKD显著提升模型泛化能力和性能，适用于资源受限设备，适合多模态感知和物理信息融合环境。

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

Motivation: 现有方法在目标模型的损失函数引导和对抗样本生成协作性方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用D2R Loss（双正则化损失）和CAG（协作对抗生成）策略，结合对抗分布和干净分布的优化，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny ImageNet等数据集上验证，D2R Loss与CAG显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss与CAG策略有效提升了深度神经网络模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

Result: 最佳土地覆盖分类性能为78.2%准确率和65.8% mIoU，使用几乎所有模态数据。

Conclusion: FLAIR-HUB为土地覆盖和作物监测提供了高质量数据集，支持未来研究。

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables
accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and
heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation
challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with
very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It
combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal
pretraining, with data and code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态伪标签学习的无监督伪装目标检测方法（UCOD-DPL），通过自适应伪标签模块、双分支对抗解码器和二次细化机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督伪装目标检测方法因伪标签噪声大和解码器简单导致性能较低，需解决这些问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合自适应伪标签模块（APM）、双分支对抗解码器（DBA）和二次细化机制（Look-Twice）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，甚至超过部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL通过动态伪标签学习和复杂解码器设计，有效提升了无监督伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

Motivation: 现有方法在室内场景合成中存在编辑限制、物理不一致、人力需求高、单房间限制和材质质量差等问题。

Result: 实验证明SceneLCM优于现有技术，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Conclusion: SceneLCM通过模块化设计和优化方法，显著提升了室内场景生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter方法在工业面板监控中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，代码和演示已开源。

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available

TL;DR: Hi-VAE是一种高效的视频自动编码框架，通过分层编码粗到细的运动表示，显著减少时空冗余，实现高压缩比和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频自动编码方法未能高效建模动态时空冗余，导致压缩效果不佳和训练成本过高。

Method: Hi-VAE将视频动态分解为全局运动和详细运动两个潜在空间，使用自监督运动编码器压缩视频潜在表示，并通过条件扩散解码器重建视频。

Result: Hi-VAE实现了1428倍的压缩比，远高于基线方法（如Cosmos-VAE的48倍），同时保持高质量重建和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Hi-VAE在高效压缩和高质量重建方面表现出色，具有可解释性和可扩展性，为视频潜在表示和生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

Motivation: 现有跟踪方法仅依赖模型到帧配准，计算量大且稳定性不足，GoTrack通过结合帧到帧配准解决这些问题。

Method: GoTrack使用标准神经网络块（基于DINOv2的Transformer）实现模型到帧配准，并采用轻量级光流模型处理帧到帧配准。

Result: GoTrack与现有粗姿态估计方法结合，在标准6DoF物体姿态估计和跟踪基准测试中达到RGB-only的领先水平。

Conclusion: GoTrack提供了一种高效、准确的6DoF物体姿态跟踪解决方案，无需特定物体训练，且计算资源需求较低。

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source

*Qiong Chang,Xinyuan Chen,Xiang Li,Weimin Wang,Jun Miyazaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法加速低端嵌入式GPU上的Oriented FAST特征检测，显著提升SLAM系统实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ORB-based SLAM系统在移动平台上实时处理能力不足，主要因Oriented FAST计算耗时。

Method: 通过二进制编码策略快速确定候选点，以及可分离的Harris检测策略结合GPU硬件指令优化。

Result: 在Jetson TX2上实验显示，相比OpenCV GPU支持版本，平均加速7.3倍。

Conclusion: 方法显著提升实时性能，适用于移动和资源受限环境。

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Method: 提出Frame Guidance，基于帧级信号（如关键帧、风格参考图等），采用简单的潜在处理方法和全局一致的潜在优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，Frame Guidance能生成高质量可控视频，适用于多种任务和输入信号。

Conclusion: Frame Guidance是一种高效、无需训练的可控视频生成方法，兼容任何视频模型。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶模型的黑盒特性导致可解释性和安全性难以保障，因此需要一种透明且灵活的训练方法。

Result: 在多个标准图像分类基准上，该方法表现出优异的泛化性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络提供了一种新颖且高效的特征反向传播训练范式，验证了其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SAP-Bench数据集和MLLM-SAP框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型在手术动作规划任务中的表现，揭示了现有模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法充分评估手术动作规划任务所需的精确分析和复杂协调能力，亟需高质量数据集和评估方法。

Method: 引入SAP-Bench数据集，包含1,226个临床验证的手术动作片段，并提出MLLM-SAP框架，利用MLLMs生成手术动作建议。

Result: 评估了七种先进MLLMs，发现其在预测下一步手术动作方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: SAP-Bench和MLLM-SAP为手术动作规划任务提供了有效评估工具，并揭示了模型改进的方向。

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法主要关注风格转换等简单任务，复杂任务如对象添加和非刚性变换研究较少。

Result: TV-LiVE在对象添加和非刚性编辑任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TV-LiVE为复杂视频编辑任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的跨模态后门攻击方法BadSem，利用语义不匹配作为隐式触发器，攻击视觉语言模型（VLMs），实验表明攻击效果显著且难以防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要依赖单模态触发器，忽略了VLMs的跨模态融合特性，因此探索基于语义不匹配的跨模态攻击具有重要意义。

Method: 提出BadSem攻击方法，通过故意错配图像-文本对在训练时注入后门，并构建SIMBad数据集支持语义操纵。

Result: BadSem在四种VLMs上平均攻击成功率超过98%，且能泛化到分布外数据集和跨模态传输。防御策略均未能有效缓解攻击。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs的语义漏洞，强调了解决此类问题以确保模型安全部署的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

Result: 在MSR-VTT、MSVD、DiDeMo和ActivityNet四个数据集上，方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过改进对比学习，论文有效解决了难负样本和细粒度语义建模问题，显著提升了文本-视频检索性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了最先进的性能，还为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements
through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process
image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to
learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various
multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex
vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a
source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit
description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the
source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context
simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper,
we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our
experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically
MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available

Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现良好，但在细粒度视觉差异上存在幻觉或语义遗漏问题，主要源于训练数据和学习目标的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Conclusion: VDMs不仅是生成引擎，还是适应性强的视觉学习器，有望成为未来视觉基础模型的核心。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Conclusion: STARFlow首次证明了归一化流在大规模和分辨率下的有效性，为高分辨率图像合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Motivation: 现有方法在去噪步骤中仅使用单次梯度更新，导致恢复效果和鲁棒性不足，尤其在嵌入式或分布外场景中。

Result: 实验表明，多步优化显著提升LPIPS和PSNR指标，并在Jetson Orin Nano上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: MPGD可作为轻量级、即插即用的恢复模块，适用于无人机和移动机器人等实时视觉感知任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin

TL;DR: FANVID是一个新的视频基准数据集，包含低分辨率（LR）视频片段，用于提升时间识别模型在模糊人脸和车牌识别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实监控中因低分辨率导致的人脸和车牌识别困难问题。

Method: 构建包含63个身份和49个车牌的数据集，定义人脸匹配和车牌识别任务，并引入评估指标。

Result: 基线方法在两项任务中分别取得0.58和0.42的分数，显示任务的可行性和挑战性。

Conclusion: FANVID旨在推动低分辨率识别中的时间建模创新，适用于监控、法医和自动驾驶等领域。

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: AllTracker是一种通过估计查询帧与视频中其他帧之间的流场来估计长距离点轨迹的模型，提供高分辨率和密集（全像素）对应字段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点跟踪方法无法提供高分辨率和密集对应字段，而现有光流方法仅能对应下一帧。AllTracker旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合光流和点跟踪技术，通过迭代推理低分辨率网格的对应估计，利用2D卷积层和像素对齐注意力层分别进行空间和时间信息传播。

Result: 模型高效（1600万参数），在高分辨率（768x1024像素）下实现最先进的点跟踪精度。

Conclusion: AllTracker通过多数据集训练和优化架构设计，显著提升了点跟踪性能，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are

Motivation: 显著性方法在可视化模型预测时存在局限性，尤其是对类别标签的区分能力不足。作者希望通过诊断测试揭示这一问题，并提出更可靠的解释方法。

Method: 提出class sensitivity诊断测试，评估显著性方法的类别区分能力。通过实验发现现有方法的不足，进而提出CASE方法，利用对比性解释技术。

Result: 实验表明，许多显著性方法对类别不敏感，CASE方法在诊断测试和保真度测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显著性方法的类别不敏感性是普遍问题，CASE方法能提供更忠实和类别特定的解释。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分层评分范式的实例图像目标导航（IIN）框架，通过优化视角选择减少冗余，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖随机采样视角或轨迹，导致冗余和计算开销大，缺乏优化的视角选择。

Method: 结合跨层级语义评分（CLIP相关场）和局部几何评分，估计最优视角进行目标匹配。

Result: 在模拟IIN基准测试中达到最优性能，并具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 分层评分范式有效减少了冗余，提升了导航效率和准确性。

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

TL;DR: 提出CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO模型，结合TPS和CBAM提升农业目标检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如YOLO）在遮挡、不规则结构和背景噪声下表现不佳，STN的仿射变换无法处理非刚性变形。

Method: 集成TPS到STN以实现非刚性空间变换，结合CBAM抑制噪声并突出关键特征。

Result: 在PGP数据集上表现优于STN-YOLO，假阳性减少12%，支持实时边缘部署。

Conclusion: 模型提升空间灵活性，适用于智能农业的高效精准监测。

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在多目标图像上表现不佳，MOS旨在通过提供额外对象对应关系改进无监督表示。

Method: 通过拼接单目标图像生成多目标图像，利用预定义的对象对应关系优化表示学习。

Result: 在ImageNet、CIFAR和COCO数据集上，MOS在单目标和多目标图像上均取得领先的无监督表示性能。

Conclusion: MOS是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升多目标图像的无监督表示学习效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

Motivation: 医学领域标注样本不足，现有方法难以精确捕捉边界细节，导致诊断误差。

Method: 结合了结果驱动的对比学习模块和动态互补竞争模块，利用两个高性能子网络生成伪标签。

Result: 在两个公开数据集（MRI和CT）上验证，性能显著优于现有方法，95HD和ASD指标提升至少6%。

Conclusion: C3S3模型有效解决了边界细节问题，为半监督医学图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Conclusion: GFVC在工业应用中前景广阔，但仍需解决当前挑战以推动未来发展。

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

Motivation: 现有的VideoLLM基准测试主要依赖选择题，无法有效评估自由文本生成任务中的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出ARGUS基准，通过比较VideoLLM生成的字幕与人工标注的真实字幕，量化幻觉率和遗漏率。

Result: ARGUS能够全面评估视频字幕生成中的幻觉（错误描述）和遗漏（重要细节缺失）问题。

Conclusion: ARGUS为VideoLLM的自由文本生成任务提供了一个更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

Motivation: 现有协作感知研究主要针对车辆类别，缺乏多类别解决方案，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了全局空间注意力融合模块（GSAF）、视觉语义重识别模块（REID）和基于速度的自适应轨迹管理模块（VATM）。

Result: 在V2X-Real和OPV2V数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多类别协作检测与跟踪问题，提升了实际场景的适用性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Method: 提出Domain Feature Navigator（DFN）作为结构化解耦器，结合SAM-SVN方法防止过拟合，并在目标域上微调DFN。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1-shot和5-shot场景下分别比现有方法提升了2.69%和4.68%的MIoU。

Conclusion: DFN和SAM-SVN方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Result: 在两个视觉数据集和八个主流视觉语言模型上验证了MrM的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MrM填补了视觉模态成员推理攻击的空白，为多模态RAG系统的隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Conclusion: 论文通过发布数据集和源代码，为CFQA研究提供了基础资源，并呼吁开发更有效的语义退化评估方法。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Conclusion: DPFormer通过动态提示方案有效解决了持续学习中的关键问题，并在多个任务中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

Result: 在CSL-Daily和Phoenix-2014T数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成的手语词汇顺序正确且语义准确性高。

Conclusion: GLOS框架通过gloss级条件和TAC模块，显著提升了SLG的性能。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Result: DeepVideo-R1在多个视频推理基准测试中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Reg-GRPO和数据增强策略有效解决了GRPO在视频大语言模型中的学习问题，提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统PRVR训练假设文本查询与视频是一对一关系，忽略了文本与视频内容之间的模糊性。本文旨在将这种模糊性纳入模型学习过程。

Method: 提出ARL框架，通过不确定性和相似性检测模糊对，采用多正对比学习和双重三元组边际损失进行分层学习，并探索视频内的细粒度关系。

Result: ARL框架在PRVR任务中表现出色，有效解决了文本-视频对的模糊性问题。

Conclusion: ARL通过检测模糊对和分层学习，显著提升了PRVR的性能，同时减少了错误传播。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Result: CoCoA-Mix在实验中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了专业化和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过混淆感知和置信感知机制，有效解决了模型专业化和泛化的核心挑战。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，DriveAnyMesh能快速生成高质量动画，兼容现代渲染引擎。

Conclusion: 该方法在游戏和电影行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

Abstract: SpatialLM is a large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data

  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: APTOS-2024挑战赛首次验证了从眼底图像生成3D OCT的潜力，为资源匮乏地区提供了可行的解决方案，并加速了医学研究和临床应用。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCPL的新策略，通过跨通道感知学习解决H&E-to-IHC研究中忽略的细胞核与细胞膜相关性，提升虚拟染色质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有H&E-to-IHC研究常忽略细胞核与细胞膜的跨通道相关性，影响病理图像分析与诊断。

Method: CCPL分解HER2免疫组化染色为Hematoxylin和DAB通道，利用Gigapath的Tile Encoder提取双通道特征并计算相关性，同时通过特征蒸馏损失增强模型能力。

Result: 实验表明CCPL在PSNR、SSIM等指标及病理学家评估中表现优异，生成高质量虚拟染色图像。

Conclusion: CCPL有效保留病理特征，为多媒体医疗数据的自动化病理诊断提供支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐驱动舞蹈生成面临多模态数据不足和灵活多条件生成的挑战，限制了生成的可控性和多样性。

Method: 构建了OpenDance5D数据集（14种舞蹈风格，101小时数据，5种模态），并提出OpenDanceNet框架，基于掩码建模实现多条件可控生成。

Result: OpenDanceNet在实验中表现出高保真和灵活的可控性。

Conclusion: OpenDance5D和OpenDanceNet为音乐驱动舞蹈生成提供了数据支持和高效方法，提升了生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces
considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the
difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,
keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于笔迹相似性的作者检索任务，探讨了文本量对检索性能的影响，发现少量文本仍能保持较高检索准确率，且深度学习方法在低文本场景下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注页面级检索，而本文旨在探索文本量（如行级和词级）对作者检索性能的影响。

Method: 评估了三种先进的作者检索系统（包括手工特征和深度学习方法），并在CVL和IAM数据集上测试了不同文本量下的性能。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用一行文本时性能下降20-30%，但四行文本即可保持90%以上的全页性能；深度学习方法（如NetVLAD）在低文本场景下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 少量文本仍能有效支持作者检索，且深度学习方法在低文本场景下更具优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在空间不一致、计算成本高或泛化能力差的问题，需要改进室内布局生成的准确性和多样性。

Method: 提出3D-SynthPlace数据集和OptiScene模型，采用两阶段训练（SFT和DPO）优化布局生成。

Result: OptiScene在布局生成质量和成功率上优于传统方法，并在交互任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 3D-SynthPlace和OptiScene为室内布局生成提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

TL;DR: SIFLip是一种新的唇读框架，通过解耦说话人特定特征，提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有唇读方法提取的视觉特征包含说话人特定属性（如唇形、颜色、纹理），导致虚假相关性，影响准确性和泛化能力。

Method: SIFLip采用隐式解耦（利用稳定文本嵌入学习跨说话人视觉表示）和显式解耦（通过说话人识别子任务和梯度反转分离说话人特征）模块。

Result: 实验表明，SIFLip在多个公开数据集上显著提升泛化性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SIFLip通过解耦说话人特定特征，有效提升了唇读模型的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-o是一个模型无关的框架，用于评估和量化多模态模型（LMMs）的不确定性，并通过实验验证其在多种任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型（LMMs）被认为比纯语言模型（LLMs）更鲁棒，但其不确定性评估仍存在三个关键问题：统一评估方法、如何提示LMMs展示不确定性，以及如何量化不确定性以支持下游任务。

Method: 提出了Uncertainty-o框架，包括模型无关的不确定性揭示方法、多模态提示扰动的实证研究，以及多模态语义不确定性的量化公式。

Result: 在18个基准测试和10种LMMs上的实验表明，Uncertainty-o能可靠估计LMMs的不确定性，并提升下游任务（如幻觉检测和缓解）的性能。

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o为多模态模型的不确定性评估提供了统一且有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

*Boyu Chen,Siran Chen,Kunchang Li,Qinglin Xu,Yu Qiao,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的超级编码网络（SEN），通过递归关联多模态编码器，增强视频理解任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型仅通过对比学习对齐不同模态的编码器，缺乏更深层次的多模态交互，限制了复杂视频场景的理解能力。

Method: 将预训练的编码器视为“超级神经元”，设计递归关联（RA）块，逐步融合多模态信息，以知识整合、分发和提示的方式递归交互。

Result: SEN显著提升了四种代表性视频任务（跟踪、识别、聊天、编辑）的表现，例如像素级跟踪的Jaccard指数提高了2.7%，文本对齐提升了6.4%。

Conclusion: SEN通过递归多模态交互，有效提升了视频理解任务的性能，为世界建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现扩散模型API可能被用于生成合成图像，进而训练替代模型，实现高效的黑盒分类模型攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力可能被恶意利用，带来安全和隐私风险，如版权侵犯和敏感信息泄露。

Method: 利用扩散模型API生成合成图像，训练替代模型，以最小查询量执行模型提取和对抗攻击。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，方法平均提升27.37%，仅用0.01倍查询预算，对抗攻击成功率达98.68%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散模型的安全威胁，需加强防护措施以防止恶意攻击。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

TL;DR: SceneRAG是一个基于大语言模型的框架，通过处理ASR转录和时间元数据将视频分割为叙事一致的场景，并结合视觉和文本模态信息构建知识图谱，显著提升了长视频理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）方法在处理长视频时，由于固定长度分段破坏了上下文连续性且无法捕捉真实场景边界，效果有限。

Method: SceneRAG利用大语言模型分割视频为叙事一致的场景，结合轻量级启发式和迭代校正优化边界，并通过多模态信息构建知识图谱支持多跳检索和生成。

Result: 在LongerVideos基准测试中，SceneRAG显著优于基线方法，生成任务的胜率高达72.5%。

Conclusion: SceneRAG通过场景分割和多模态知识图谱，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative
decision-making, skill assessment, and postoperative quality improvement.
However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains
hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and
systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain
generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are

Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的图像编辑方法存在模糊性和复杂性问题，难以高质量完成编辑任务。

Method: 将拖拽编辑重新定义为变形、旋转和平移用户指定区域，提出Latent Region Optimization (LRO)和Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI)框架。

Result: DragNeXt在NextBench上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DragNeXt通过简化流程和利用区域结构信息，有效提升了基于拖拽的图像编辑质量。

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Result: 虚拟IMU数据显著优于真实或增强数据，尤其在数据有限时。

Conclusion: 提供选择数据生成策略的实用建议，并分析各方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的VLM计算需求高，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署，视觉输入中存在大量冗余信息。

Method: EP-VLM采用事件数据引导的视觉输入稀疏化策略，并结合位置保留的tokenization方法处理稀疏输入。

Result: EP-VLM在Qwen2-VL-2B上实现50%的FLOPs节省，同时保持98%的原始精度。

Conclusion: 事件视觉先验可显著提升VLM效率，为边缘设备上的高效视觉理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

Result: 实验显示HuSc3D能有效区分模型性能，揭示传统数据集掩盖的局限性。

Conclusion: HuSc3D填补了真实场景3D重建评估的空白，为模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Result: ROBIN-3B模型在关系理解基准测试中超越同类模型，并在指代表达理解任务中达到88.9分，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于高质量场景图数据的训练对提升视觉推理任务性能至关重要。

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

TL;DR: FMaMIL是一种基于图像级标签的弱监督病灶分割框架，通过两阶段方法（Mamba编码器和频率域编码模块）提升分割效果，无需像素级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组织病理学图像中病灶分割的挑战，尤其是像素级标注成本高的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）使用Mamba编码器和频率域编码模块生成CAMs；2）通过软标签监督和自校正机制优化伪标签。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: FMaMIL在无需像素级标注的情况下有效，适用于数字病理学。

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

TL;DR: ProSplat提出了一种两阶段前馈框架，用于宽基线条件下的高保真渲染，通过3D高斯生成器和改进模型提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在宽基线场景下因纹理细节不足和几何不一致导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 第一阶段生成3D高斯基元，第二阶段通过改进模型（基于扩散模型）增强渲染视图，结合MORI和DWEA优化。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV-10K数据集上，PSNR平均提升1 dB。

Conclusion: ProSplat在宽基线条件下显著提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities
of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验验证了NOVA3D在生成质量和多视角一致性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NOVA3D通过创新的框架和算法，显著提升了单图像到3D生成的效果。

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了不同退化类型的多样性，采用单一网络模型处理多种退化问题。研究发现退化类型可分为空间无关和空间相关两类，需要针对性解决。

Method: 设计了动态滤波网络，包含全局和局部分支：全局分支通过注意力机制生成权重处理空间无关退化；局部分支生成空间相关动态滤波算子处理空间相关退化。

Result: 该方法在合成和真实图像数据集上优于现有盲超分辨率算法。

Conclusion: 通过区分并针对性处理两类退化类型，动态滤波网络显著提升了图像重建效果。

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法难以处理复杂运动模式（如多对象和肖像编辑），且局限于对象替换任务。光流为复杂运动建模提供了新思路。

Method: FlowV2V将任务分解为第一帧编辑和条件I2V生成，通过模拟伪光流序列确保编辑时的形状对齐和时间一致性。

Conclusion: FlowV2V通过光流驱动的I2V生成，显著提升了视频编辑的性能，尤其在复杂运动场景中表现突出。

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN在保持高效性的同时显著提升了SNN的准确性和信息容量。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ETA通过异步设计和批量推断，成功实现了大模型的快速响应，提升了自动驾驶系统的性能。

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE通过CSGC和轻量级设计，实现了高性能低功耗的单目3D目标检测，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Method: 构建ArchDiffBench数据集（1,765张高质量建筑图像及风格标注），开发ArchiLense框架（结合视觉语言模型和深度学习算法）进行自动识别与分类。

Result: ArchiLense在建筑风格识别中表现优异，与专家标注一致性达92.4%，分类准确率为84.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法超越了传统主观分析，为建筑文化比较研究提供了更客观、准确的视角。

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream

### [144] [Difference Inversion: Interpolate and Isolate the Difference with Token Consistency for Image Analogy Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07750)
*Hyunsoo Kim,Donghyun Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Difference Inversion的方法，通过提取A和A'之间的差异并应用于B，生成更合理的B'，解决了现有方法对特定模型的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如视觉上下文学习或视觉指令通常局限于特定模型，可能导致偏见或编辑能力受限。

Method: 提出Difference Inversion，包括Delta插值、Token一致性损失和Token嵌入的零初始化，以精确提取差异并应用于B。

Result: 实验表明，Difference Inversion在定量和定性上均优于现有基线，能够以模型无关的方式生成更可行的B'。

Conclusion: Difference Inversion是一种有效的模型无关方法，能够生成更合理的图像编辑结果。

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视觉表示、语义分割和用户行为模拟的时尚推荐系统，通过加权评分函数实现个性化推荐，实验表明其性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时尚推荐系统往往忽略用户行为和趋势的影响，本文旨在结合视觉、语义和流行度信息，提供更个性化的推荐。

Method: 系统通过语义分割提取服装区域特征，结合预训练CNN提取视觉嵌入；模拟用户购物行为生成购买历史；通过加权评分函数融合视觉相似性、语义一致性和流行度。

Result: 在DeepFashion数据集上，ResNet-50表现最佳，类别相似性达64.95%，流行度MAE最低。消融实验验证了视觉和流行度线索的互补作用。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可扩展的框架，能平衡个人风格与流行趋势，实现个性化时尚推荐。

Abstract: We introduce a trend-aware and visually-grounded fashion recommendation
system that integrates deep visual representations, garment-aware segmentation,
semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline
extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic
segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones
(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the
complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a
scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations that balances
individual style with emerging trends. Our implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在泛化性能上表现不足，VLAgent旨在通过分步规划和执行验证解决这一问题。

Method: VLAgent分两阶段工作：任务规划阶段通过上下文学习生成分步计划；执行阶段通过神经符号模块生成高置信度结果。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试中，VLAgent性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VLAgent通过优化模块（如SS-Parser和Plan Repairer）提升了多模态推理能力。

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文构建了一个高质量的双光谱数据集，并提出了一种全面的评估框架，验证了融合模型在下游任务中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前可见光与红外图像融合方法缺乏标准化评估和高质量数据集的问题。

Method: 构建了包含1,369对对齐图像的数据集，并提出融合速度、通用指标和目标检测性能的综合评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，针对下游任务优化的融合模型在目标检测中表现更优，尤其是在低光和遮挡场景下。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括高质量数据集、任务感知的评估框架以及对现有融合方法的深入分析，为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Result: 在多个VQA数据集上达到最先进性能，显著优于ICL和Vanilla-RAG方法。

Conclusion: RCTS框架通过高质量上下文推理和重排序方法，有效提升了LVLMs的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过图像重建解释视觉特征的新方法，比较了SigLIP和SigLIP2模型家族，发现基于图像任务预训练的编码器保留更多图像信息。方法适用于任何视觉编码器，揭示了特征空间的内在结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉编码器在现代应用中广泛使用，但其内部特征表示方式仍不明确。

Method: 通过图像重建比较不同训练目标的视觉编码器（如SigLIP和SigLIP2），并分析特征空间的信息量和结构。

Result: 基于图像任务预训练的编码器保留更多图像信息；特征空间的旋转控制颜色编码。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解视觉编码器的特征表示提供了新视角，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Result: 实验表明，UGTSR在纹理真实性和重建保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UGTSR框架有效提升了超分辨率任务中的纹理重建和特征匹配性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoQA方法依赖显式视觉证据，但在涉及符号意义或深层意图时表现不佳，因此需要解决隐式视觉证据问题。

Method: 提出IRM框架，包括AIM（生成线索候选并推理关系）和VEM（增强视觉表示），通过双流建模处理隐式问题。

Result: IRM在I-VQA任务中表现优于GPT-4o等模型，提升幅度为0.76%至4.87%，并在类似任务中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: IRM有效解决了隐式视觉证据问题，为VideoQA领域提供了新思路和方法。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定尺度超分辨率方法灵活性不足，而现有任意尺度方法多为单阶段上采样，难以适应连续分布的缩放因子。

Method: 采用自级联扩散框架，将缩放需求分解为更小的连续因子，逐步增强分辨率，并结合坐标引导的残差扩散模型。

Result: CasArbi在多种任意尺度超分辨率基准测试中，感知和失真性能均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasArbi通过级联扩散和坐标引导残差扩散模型，实现了高效且灵活的任意尺度图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

TL;DR: M2Restore提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Experts的Mamba-CNN融合框架，用于高效且鲁棒的一体化图像恢复，解决了现有方法在动态变化退化场景中的泛化能力不足以及局部细节与全局依赖关系平衡不佳的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 自然图像常受复杂退化（如雨、雪、雾）影响，现有图像恢复方法在泛化能力和局部与全局特征平衡方面存在不足。

Method: 1. 利用CLIP引导的MoE门控机制，结合任务条件提示和CLIP语义先验；2. 设计双流架构，融合CNN的局部表征能力和Mamba的长程建模效率；3. 引入边缘感知动态门控机制，自适应平衡全局建模与局部增强。

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准测试中，M2Restore在视觉质量和定量性能上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: M2Restore通过创新的架构设计和门控机制，显著提升了图像恢复的性能和效率。

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

Result: 模型在数据流形附近表现分歧，训练集规模和数据几何影响去噪轨迹和评分准确性。

Conclusion: 为扩散模型在低噪声条件下的行为提供了新见解，有助于理解其学习数据分布的方式。

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割在环境监测和城市规划中至关重要，但传统方法因下采样或分块处理导致细节丢失或全局上下文碎片化。多分支网络虽解决此问题，但存在计算效率低和梯度冲突问题。

Method: F2Net将图像分解为高频和低频分量，高频分支保留全分辨率结构细节，低频分支通过双子分支捕获短程和长程依赖关系。混合频率融合模块结合这些观察结果，并通过交叉频率对齐损失和平衡损失优化训练。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和Inria Aerial基准测试中，F2Net分别达到80.22和83.39的mIoU，表现最优。

Conclusion: F2Net通过频率分解和融合模块，实现了超高分辨率遥感图像的高效语义分割，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: PolyVivid为多主体视频定制提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing

### [158] [SAM2Auto: Auto Annotation Using FLASH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07850)
*Arash Rocky,Q. M. Jonathan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2Auto是一个全自动视频数据集标注工具，无需人工干预或数据集特定训练，显著减少标注时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因标注数据集稀缺而发展受限的问题。

Method: 结合SMART-OD（自动掩码生成与开放世界目标检测）和FLASH（实时视频实例分割与一致性跟踪）。

Result: 实验表明，SAM2Auto的标注精度与人工相当，同时大幅提升效率。

Conclusion: SAM2Auto为自动化视频标注设定了新基准，加速了VLM的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogoSP是一种无监督3D语义分割方法，通过结合局部和全局点特征学习语义，利用频域中的全局模式生成伪标签，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督方法仅依赖局部特征，缺乏对全局语义的捕捉能力，LogoSP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LogoSP通过频域中的全局模式对超点进行分组，生成高精度伪标签，用于训练分割网络。

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP大幅超越现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了无监督学习中全局模式的有效性，能够捕捉有意义的3D语义。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

*Ivan Alberico,Marco Cannici,Giovanni Cioffi,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机的实时乒乓球轨迹预测系统，利用高时间分辨率解决传统相机的延迟和运动模糊问题，并通过注视数据优化计算资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在高速度运动中存在延迟和模糊问题，事件相机的高时间分辨率能够更频繁地更新状态，提高轨迹预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 收集了包含3D真实轨迹的乒乓球比赛数据集，结合Meta Project Aria眼镜的传感器数据和事件流，利用注视数据实现注视区域的事件处理，减少计算延迟。

Result: 系统的最坏情况下总延迟为4.5毫秒，显著优于30 FPS帧基系统的66毫秒延迟，计算资源分配效率提高了10.81倍。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于事件相机和注视数据的乒乓球轨迹预测系统，为实时运动分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

TL;DR: FreeGave方法从多视角视频中学习3D场景的几何、外观和物理特性，无需物体先验知识，通过物理编码和发散自由模块实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂物理运动或边界时表现不佳，且依赖物体先验知识（如掩码或类型）。FreeGave旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入物理编码和发散自由模块，估计每个高斯速度场，避免低效的PINN损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的优越性，尤其在未来帧外推和运动分割任务中。物理编码成功学习了无标签的3D物理运动模式。

Conclusion: FreeGave无需先验知识即可高效学习复杂动态3D场景的物理特性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在低延迟运动估计（光流）中效率不足，而异步事件相机方法虽高效但时空信息捕捉不足。

Method: 引入STSSM模块和新网络架构，利用状态空间模型高效捕捉事件数据的时空相关性。

Result: 在DSEC基准测试中，模型推理速度比TMA快4.5倍，计算量比EV-FlowNet低2倍，性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: STSSM方法在高效性和性能上均优于现有技术，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep
learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management,
safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a
robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing
detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their
orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block
Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,
and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and
improve urban mobility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视觉数据（如RGB视频、深度、相机姿态和注视）的多模态理解在增强现实、机器人和人机交互中至关重要，但数据异构性和缺失模态的伪标签生成困难限制了现有方法的扩展。

Method: 提出了EgoM2P框架，结合高效的时序标记器和掩码建模，支持多任务学习，包括注视预测、相机跟踪和深度估计。

Conclusion: EgoM2P是一个高效、通用的自我中心视觉模型，将开源以推动研究。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对视频扩散模型的无学习技术，仅需5对多模态提示对即可生成拒绝向量，用于消除模型中的有害概念，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型可能继承训练数据中的偏见和有害内容，导致用户生成不良或非法内容，亟需解决方案。

Method: 通过多模态提示对生成拒绝向量，并采用低秩分解方法优化，直接嵌入模型参数以消除有害概念。

Result: 方法有效中和多种有害内容（如裸露、暴力、版权等），且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: 该技术无需重新训练或原始数据，直接嵌入拒绝方向，提高了对抗规避的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

Motivation: 探索VLMs是否真正具备多模态上下文学习能力，以及其在分布偏移下的表现。

Method: 提出一种新的MM-ICL with Reasoning流程，为每个示例生成答案和推理过程，并在不同数据集和模型上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs对演示级信息的利用有限，性能对演示数量、检索方法等因素不敏感。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态上下文学习中未能有效利用演示信息，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖视觉语言模型，但图像标记化破坏了空间关系，需要一种能保留空间和语义信息的新方法。

Method: DTwinSeger将任务分为两阶段：1) 将图像转换为结构化DT表示；2) 使用LLM在DT表示上进行显式推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，证明DT表示是视觉与文本间的有效桥梁。

Conclusion: DTwinSeger通过DT表示和LLM的结合，成功实现了复杂的多模态推理任务。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are
available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

*Jiahao Meng,Shuyang Sun,Yue Tan,Lu Qi,Yunhai Tong,Xiangtai Li,Longyin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CyberV的新框架，通过引入控制论原理改进多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频理解中的表现，解决了计算需求高、鲁棒性不足和准确性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理长或复杂视频时存在计算需求高、鲁棒性不足和准确性有限的问题，尤其是参数较少的模型表现更差。

Method: 提出CyberV框架，通过传感器监控MLLM的前向过程并收集中间解释（如注意力漂移），控制器触发自校正并生成反馈，动态调整资源分配。

Result: 实验显示CyberV显著提升了模型性能（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升8.3%），甚至在某些任务上达到人类专家水平。

Conclusion: CyberV框架有效提升了MLLMs在动态视频理解中的鲁棒性和准确性，且无需重新训练或增加组件。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OneIG-Bench，一个用于全面评估文本到图像（T2I）模型的多维度基准框架，填补了现有评估系统的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型的评估系统在推理能力、文本渲染和风格等方面缺乏全面性，无法满足最新模型的需求。

Method: 设计了OneIG-Bench框架，支持多维度（如提示-图像对齐、文本渲染精度、推理生成内容等）的细粒度评估，并允许用户灵活选择评估子集。

Result: OneIG-Bench提供了深入的模型性能分析工具，帮助研究者识别图像生成流程中的优势和瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该基准框架的公开可用性将促进T2I研究社区的可重复评估和跨模型比较。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient method for real-time three-dimensional

to previous work, our approach introduces a multi-mode state model with $W$
discrete modes to significantly accelerate optimization while preserving
centimeter-level accuracy -- even in cases of severe occlusion, motion blur,
and complex backgrounds. The system operates on standard CPUs and achieves low
latency suitable for live broadcast settings. Extensive evaluation on a
proprietary dataset of 6K-resolution Russian Premier League matches
demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football
environments.

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

Method: 引入重要性采样选择最有价值的输入样本，并采用贝叶斯方法聚合多个评分，以减少噪音和成本。

Result: 实现了约30倍的成本降低和5倍的评分数量减少，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了神经元解释评估的效率和准确性，为大规模研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的MM-DiT模型（如FLUX）在文本驱动的视觉生成中仍存在文本与生成内容对齐不精确的问题，主要源于跨模态注意力机制的不足。

Method: 提出了TACA方法，通过温度缩放和时序感知调整动态平衡跨模态交互，并结合LoRA微调，以最小计算开销提升对齐效果。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中，TACA显著提升了文本与图像的匹配度，包括物体外观、属性绑定和空间关系。

Conclusion: TACA方法有效解决了跨模态注意力不平衡问题，提升了文本到图像扩散模型的语义保真度。

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基于示例的编辑方法仍依赖文本提示或隐式文本指令，难以精确指定某些编辑语义。

Method: 提出目标噪声预测和内容保留噪声调度，通过优化LoRAs分离语义变化与内容学习。

Result: PairEdit成功学习复杂语义，显著提升内容一致性。

Conclusion: PairEdit为无文本指导的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: UA-Pose提出了一种不确定性感知的6D物体姿态估计方法，适用于部分参考数据，显著提升了在不完整观测下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要完整3D模型或大量参考图像，而部分参考数据（如少量RGBD图像或单张2D图像）下的姿态估计仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于部分参考数据初始化不完整3D模型，引入不确定性区分已见和未见区域，并通过不确定性感知采样策略在线补全物体。

Result: 在YCB-Video等数据集上，UA-Pose显著优于现有方法，尤其在观测不完整时表现突出。

Conclusion: UA-Pose通过不确定性建模和在线补全，有效解决了部分参考数据下的6D姿态估计问题。

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合模型缺乏系统指导如何分配模型能力，MADFormer旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MADFormer将图像生成分为空间块，使用AR层进行全局条件化，扩散层进行局部细化。

Result: 实验表明，块分区显著提升高分辨率图像性能，混合层在质量与效率间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: MADFormer为未来混合生成模型提供了实用设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating

unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D

Motivation: 音频与视觉世界紧密同步，是可控视频生成的理想控制信号，但现有方法在高质量视频生成和精确音视频同步方面表现不足。

Method: MTV框架将音频分离为语音、效果和音乐轨道，分别控制唇部动作、事件时间和视觉情绪，并利用DEMIX数据集进行多阶段训练。

Result: MTV在视频质量、文本-视频一致性和音视频对齐六个标准指标上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MTV通过音频分离和多阶段训练，实现了高质量且精确同步的视频生成，为音频叙事可视化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，通过噪声初始化阶段的结构化潜在操作，可以有效实现动态视图合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练或额外模块的情况下，实现了高质量的动态视图合成。

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world
deployment at scale.

Result: 实验显示Dreamland在图像质量上提升50.8%，可控性增强17.9%，并有助于AI代理训练。

Conclusion: Dreamland通过分层抽象和中间表示，显著提升了生成模型的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained

training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image

### [187] [Hidden in plain sight: VLMs overlook their visual representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08008)
*Stephanie Fu,Tyler Bonnen,Devin Guillory,Trevor Darrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了视觉语言模型（VLMs）与其视觉编码器的表现，发现VLMs在视觉任务中表现显著较差，接近随机水平。研究分析了三个可能原因：视觉表征退化、任务提示的脆弱性以及语言模型在任务中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何整合视觉和语言信息，以理解其在视觉任务中的表现瓶颈。

Method: 通过一系列视觉中心基准测试（如深度估计、对应关系）比较VLMs与其视觉编码器的表现，并分析VLMs的失败模式。

Result: VLMs在视觉任务中表现显著低于视觉编码器，主要瓶颈在于语言模型未能有效利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在视觉任务中的失败模式，为未来改进提供了诊断工具和评估方法。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

*Xun Huang,Zhengqi Li,Guande He,Mingyuan Zhou,Eli Shechtman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self Forcing是一种新的自回归视频扩散模型训练范式，通过自生成输出和KV缓存解决曝光偏差问题，实现高效实时视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在推理时依赖自身不完美输出导致的曝光偏差问题。

Method: 采用自回归展开和KV缓存，结合视频级整体损失和随机梯度截断策略。

Result: 在单GPU上实现亚秒级延迟的实时视频生成，质量优于或匹配非因果扩散模型。

Conclusion: Self Forcing在高效性和生成质量上均表现出色，适用于实时视频生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了Vision Transformers中高范数令牌导致噪声注意力图的机制，并提出了一种无需重新训练的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高范数令牌导致注意力图噪声，影响视觉处理性能，现有方法需重新训练模型，作者希望找到无需训练的方法。

Method: 通过将高范数激活转移到额外的未训练令牌中，模拟注册令牌的效果。

Result: 方法生成了更干净的注意力和特征图，提升了多个下游视觉任务的性能，效果接近显式训练注册令牌的模型。

Conclusion: 测试时注册令牌可替代训练时的注册令牌，为预训练模型提供无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

TL;DR: ViGaL是一种通过玩街机游戏提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）泛化推理能力的新方法，显著提升了模型在数学和多学科问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，游戏能促进可迁移的认知技能，因此通过游戏训练MLLMs以提升其跨领域推理能力。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）在简单街机游戏（如Snake）上对7B参数的MLLM进行后训练，无需接触具体问题或图表。

Result: 模型在MathVista和MMMU等基准测试中表现优于专业模型，同时保持基础模型在通用视觉任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 合成规则游戏可作为可控且可扩展的预训练任务，解锁MLLMs的泛化多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

Motivation: 多任务学习需要大量标注，而部分任务标注或零样本设置可以缓解这一问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型，结合任务编码、任务条件化和统一潜在损失，设计多流模型和任务注意力机制。

Result: 在8个基准测试的7个任务上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StableMTL通过创新设计和高效任务交互，显著提升了多任务学习的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

TL;DR: 4DGT是一种基于4D高斯的Transformer模型，用于动态场景重建，仅需单目视频输入即可高效建模复杂时变环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景重建中效率低且难以处理长时输入，4DGT旨在通过4D高斯和Transformer结合，实现高效且准确的动态建模。

Method: 提出4D高斯作为归纳偏置，统一静态和动态组件，并引入密度控制策略以处理长时输入，采用滚动窗口方式处理64帧连续视频。

Result: 4DGT在单目视频上显著优于其他高斯网络，与优化方法在跨域视频上精度相当，且推理时间从小时级降至秒级。

Conclusion: 4DGT通过4D高斯和Transformer的结合，实现了高效、准确的动态场景重建，适用于长时视频输入。

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene
reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D
Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

Motivation: 金融推理需要结合文本和视觉数据，现有方法在复杂金融场景中表现不足，需改进。

Method: 构建包含3200个专家级问题的基准，提出错误感知学习框架，利用历史错误反馈指导推理。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升性能，错误反馈带来持续改进，但视觉理解和数学逻辑仍具挑战。

Conclusion: 自反思推理在金融AI系统中具有潜力，基准和框架为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also
the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend
graphs. This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI
models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in
finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs
across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textual and
visual modalities to reflect authentic analytical challenges in finance. To
address limitations in current reasoning approaches, we propose an error-aware
learning framework that leverages historical model mistakes and feedback to
guide inference, without requiring fine-tuning. Our experiments across
state-of-the-art models show that multimodal inputs significantly enhance
performance and that incorporating error feedback leads to consistent and
measurable improvements. The results highlight persistent challenges in visual
understanding and mathematical logic, while also demonstrating the promise of
self-reflective reasoning in financial AI systems. Our code and data can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在建模不存在实体时存在不足，要么过度依赖形而上学假设，要么引入计算效率问题。本文旨在提供一种实用且计算可行的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于基本形式本体论的结构化方法，通过实际类型的交集建模不存在实体，避免使用虚拟实例或模态逻辑。

Result: 提出了一种新的框架，能够更高效且实用地处理对假设或不存在实体的引用。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理不存在实体提供了一种实用且计算可行的解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities
that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional
entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches
that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a
proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of
actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions
itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments,
emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely
metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to
non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or
introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing
a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to
provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to
hypothetical or non existent entities.

Result: ePL模型在准确性和计算成本之间取得平衡，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: 通过公开这些模型，evolvingfuzzysystems旨在推动自适应和可解释机器学习的研究与应用。

Abstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their
ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while
maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available
implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread
adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python
library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models,
including ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG, ePL, exTS, Simpl\_eTS, and eTS. The
library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools
for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are
evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance
measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional
error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally,
computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule
evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a
simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost,
making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these
models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and
practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在交通领域具有变革潜力，但仍需解决幻觉、数据隐私、部署复杂性等问题，未来研究方向包括多模态融合和时空推理增强。

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern
transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of
addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional
engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of
real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural
language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a
promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application
and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key
focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and
multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's
unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes
diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal
control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).
Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation
models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.
Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM
limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,
bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety
assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including
advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI
collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient,
verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current
capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative
potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize
safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 预期揭示人-代理协作的术语多样性、任务领域动态性及理论框架的适用性。

Conclusion: 研究将为人-代理协作领域的术语标准化和理论发展提供指导。

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning
and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this
collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For
example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both
"collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation"
are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle
differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary
research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this
collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this
human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we
are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task
domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration
is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent
interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can
also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different
task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,
complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive
theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure
human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it
can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent
collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new
frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs因固定上下文窗口和内存管理不足，导致长期记忆能力差和个性化体验受限，亟需解决方案。

Method: 设计MemoryOS，包含分层存储架构（短、中、长期记忆）和四个关键模块（存储、更新、检索、生成），采用动态更新策略。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，F1和BLEU-1分别平均提升49.11%和46.18%，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MemoryOS通过分层存储和动态更新，显著提升了LLMs的长期记忆能力和个性化交互效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context
windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of
long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive
experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose
a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and
efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management
principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage
architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating,
Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three
levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term
personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between
storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based
FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page
organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory
integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark
show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the
baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory
retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 研究者对高级AI可能带来的灾难性风险表示担忧，认为强大的AI代理会追求权力，因为权力是一种工具性收敛目标。然而，也有人对此表示怀疑。本文旨在澄清这些概念并评估其合理性。

Method: 采用抽象的决策理论框架形式化工具性收敛和权力追求的概念。

Result: 权力确实具有工具性收敛的某些特征，但在缺乏代理最终目标的具体信息时，其预测效用可能有限。

Conclusion: 权力作为工具性收敛目标有一定合理性，但对具有绝对或接近绝对权力能力的代理更具预测性。

Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued
that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over
humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is
useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed
skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of
instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic
framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental
goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but
might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options
cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive
information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental
convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining
absolute or near-absolute power.

<details>

Motivation: 现有时序知识图谱嵌入模型在推理时依赖训练中已见的实体、关系和时间信息，限制了其在新领域和真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用正弦位置编码捕捉细粒度时间模式，通过消息传递生成基于局部和全局时间上下文的适应性实体和关系表示。

Conclusion: POSTRA作为一种预训练、可扩展和可迁移的模型，为时序知识图谱的基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats
(s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform
link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means
the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully
or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during
inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize
to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning
representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable
and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph
link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture
fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation
representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global
temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and
time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and
facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained,
scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot
performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to
novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot
performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a
significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

*Yanwei Ren,Haotian Zhang,Fuxiang Wu,Jiayan Qiu,Jiaxing Huang,Baosheng Yu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMA框架通过重新利用搜索树中被丢弃的非最优推理分支，显著提升大语言模型的推理能力，减少数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅保留搜索树中的最优轨迹，丢弃了包含有价值信息的非最优分支，导致数据浪费。

Method: SIGMA通过语义链接和两阶段优化（批评模型和修订模型）重新整合非最优分支，提升推理轨迹。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，SIGMA优化的7B模型仅用30K样本达到54.92%准确率，优于使用590K样本的现有模型。

Conclusion: SIGMA不仅大幅减少数据需求，还显著提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ScriptDoctor，一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于自动生成和测试PuzzleScript游戏，展示了LLM在自动游戏设计中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型预训练模型在自动游戏设计（AGD）中的应用多依赖于人工监督，缺乏长期自主生成和测试的整合。

Method: ScriptDoctor通过迭代循环生成和测试游戏设计，利用人类示例、PuzzleScript引擎的编译错误和基于搜索的代理进行游戏测试。

Result: ScriptDoctor展示了LLM在自动生成新颖游戏内容方面的潜力。

Conclusion: ScriptDoctor为LLM在自动游戏设计中的开放工作流程提供了具体示例。

Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game
Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract
conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from
the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision.
Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into
longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines
to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor,
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and
testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description
language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates
and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples
are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the
PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents
play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the
potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game
content.

*Suhana Bedi,Iddah Mlauzi,Daniel Shin,Sanmi Koyejo,Nigam H. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多代理AI系统在临床中表现优于单代理系统，但组件优化（Best of Breed）虽在信息准确性上表现优异（85.5%），诊断准确性却显著低于多代理系统（67.7% vs. 77.4%），强调需关注信息流和代理兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多代理AI系统中组件优化与系统整体性能的关系，以提升临床诊断效果。

Method: 使用MIMIC-CDM数据集中的2,400例真实患者数据，分解临床诊断为信息收集、解释和鉴别诊断，对比单代理与多代理系统的表现。

Result: 多代理系统整体表现更优，但组件优化系统在诊断准确性上显著落后。

Conclusion: AI在医疗中的成功整合需关注信息流和代理兼容性，强调端到端系统验证的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization
and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this
relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across
four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,
interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems
(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized
models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,
process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while
multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the
component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and
excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly
underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent
system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in
healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to
information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the
need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics
alone.

new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of
physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability
to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In
this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI
simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends
and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components.
Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide
architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research
opportunities for prospective researchers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GELD是一种新型神经TSP求解器，通过全局评估和局部选择框架，结合轻量级全局编码器和重量级局部解码器，显著提升求解质量和速度，并能处理大规模TSP问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经TSP求解器难以同时高效解决小规模和大规模TSP问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出GELD框架，结合全局编码器和局部解码器，采用低复杂度注意力机制和两阶段训练策略。

Result: GELD在合成和真实数据集上优于七种先进模型，并能处理多达744,710个节点的大规模TSP问题。

Conclusion: GELD不仅提升了求解质量和效率，还可作为后处理方法优化现有求解器的结果。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial
optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in
neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless,
these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale
TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their
practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP
solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined
local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight
Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich
embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process.
Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing
GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs.
Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training
instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering
both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as
a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions
derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional
computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to
744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying
on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的框架CER，通过动态记忆缓冲区积累和综合过去经验，提升语言模型代理在复杂任务中的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型代理在复杂任务中缺乏环境特定经验，且无法在推理时持续学习，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出Contextual Experience Replay (CER)框架，通过动态记忆缓冲区积累和综合环境动态及决策模式，使代理能在新任务中检索相关知识。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena基准测试中，CER分别取得31.9%和36.7%的成功率，相对GPT-4o基线提升51.0%。

Conclusion: CER通过高效自我改进机制显著提升了语言模型代理在复杂环境中的适应性和任务成功率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系统建模与AI规划之间的鸿沟，提供一种可重用的桥梁。

Method: 定义可重用的PDDL概念原型，并通过OCL约束确保语法一致性，基于PDDL 3.1的BNF定义与SysML建模实践对齐。

Result: 通过飞机制造案例验证，成功生成PDDL格式的领域和问题描述，并用于优化执行计划。

Conclusion: 该方法支持模型驱动的规划描述生成，为工程设计中的系统建模与AI规划提供了实用工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of
planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into
system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as
types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure
syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study
from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a
robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to
generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as
input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach
supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and
provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in
engineering design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽具备通用知识，但在结构化领域（如模拟环境）中难以生成精确预测，因其无法将广泛的无结构知识落地到具体环境。

Method: WorldLLM通过贝叶斯推理和强化学习驱动的主动探索，利用LLM的上下文学习能力，迭代优化自然语言假设以指导预测。

Result: 实验表明，WorldLLM在文本游戏环境中显著提升了预测准确性，并生成了可解释的环境动态理论。

Conclusion: WorldLLM框架有效解决了LLM在结构化领域中的预测局限性，同时提供了可解释的理论生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在图像选项的数学推理能力上研究不足，VisioMath填补了这一空白。

Method: VisioMath包含8,070张图像和1,800道多选题，每个选项为图像，用于评估模型在图像选项下的数学推理能力。

Result: 即使是GPT-4o等先进模型，在VisioMath上的准确率仅为45.9%，显示当前模型在视觉相似选项推理上的局限性。

Conclusion: VisioMath为未来多模态推理研究提供了严格的测试基准，推动技术进步。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过缩小假设空间来优化归纳逻辑编程（ILP）的方法，利用背景知识提前排除无效规则，显著减少学习时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ILP系统在搜索假设空间时效率较低，希望通过预处理缩小假设空间以提高学习速度。

Method: 使用背景知识识别并移除不可能出现在最优假设中的规则，采用答案集编程实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉推理和游戏等多个领域中，能将学习时间从10小时以上缩短至2秒，同时保持预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过预处理显著提升了ILP系统的效率，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a
deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized
treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings,
we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance
psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced
conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a
multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue
reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which
contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues.
We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23%
in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality.
The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for

Motivation: 解决SNN训练中的挑战，探索不同学习算法对分类准确性的影响，并开发高效的生物启发分类方法。

Method: 结合SNN和Lempel-Ziv复杂度（LZC）构建生物启发分类器，比较反向传播算法与生物启发算法（如tempotron和Spikprop）的性能。

Result: 反向传播算法分类准确但计算成本高；生物启发算法在保持性能的同时更高效，适合实时应用。

Conclusion: 选择学习算法需权衡分类准确性和计算成本，生物启发算法在时间敏感任务中更具优势。

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique
properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events,
and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the
influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

Conclusion: CA-MIQ适用于任何具有分段平稳信息价值分布的离散环境，能有效适应优先级变化。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions
must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting
to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware
Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever
mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task
reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location
awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers
transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to
re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where
experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of
information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly
four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority
shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios,
achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results
highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with
piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Result: Xent Games空间足够丰富，包含多种有趣的任务，可用于构建能力基准测试。

Conclusion: Xent Games为LLMs的能力评估提供了新方法，并通过进化动力学思想解决了无边界范围问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

<details>

Motivation: LLM在复杂任务中因认知负载限制表现不佳，类比人类认知负载理论（CLT），提出改进方案。

Method: 基于CLT设计CoThinker框架，通过代理分工和结构化通信管理认知负载。

Result: 实验验证CoThinker在复杂任务中优于现有基线，提升解决方案质量和效率。

Conclusion: CoThinker为克服LLM性能瓶颈提供了理论支持，展示了集体认知的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on
complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse
information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation
arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load
capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory
(CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in
the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs
have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded
understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework
designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative
problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by
distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing
transactional load via structured communication and a collective working
memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and
fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over
existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis
reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the
emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering
a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合SafeML和贝叶斯网络的概率安全保证框架，用于动态评估和适应ML在安全关键系统中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML模型在安全关键系统中的广泛应用带来了新的失败类型（如分布偏移引发的推理失败），传统安全评估方法不适用于ML组件。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将SafeML与贝叶斯网络结合，动态检测分布偏移并建模ML失败。

Result: 在模拟的自动驾驶队列系统中验证了框架的有效性，展示了显式建模ML失败在安全评估中的潜在优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为ML在安全关键系统中的动态安全评估和适应提供了新方法。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical
systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time
decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of
failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between
operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which
rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn
behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such
shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components.
Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that
integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of
a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and
system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an
simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The
findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML
failures in safety assessment.

Conclusion: KDR框架和KCII模型显著提升了深度知识分析的能力，优于主流深度研究框架。

Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and
association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical
reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing
deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic
organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making
it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They
cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to
produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we
propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})
framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.
Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to
preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.
Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of
reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above
framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge
organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge
organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,
transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it
generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain
deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across
six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,
when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports
with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research
framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种元学习方法，通过蒸馏任务相关的图像特征生成软提示，以提升小规模LMM在少样本任务中的性能。

Motivation: 解决小规模LMM在上下文学习中性能不一致的问题，避免图像嵌入中无关信息对任务的干扰。

Method: 引入注意力映射模块与软提示联合学习，结合LLaVA v1.5架构，实现少样本任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上表现优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，尤其在图像扰动下仍保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LMM在少样本任务中的适应性和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is
important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event
reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections
between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning
tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this
challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A
enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality
during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as
well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to
causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on
specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of
discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate
the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,
and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a
causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more
informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall
approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results
with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我纠正方法依赖额外提示和系统设计，无法实现实时自发纠正，SPOC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPOC采用多智能体视角，赋予模型双重角色（解提议者和验证者），并通过合成数据微调和在线强化学习提升能力。

Conclusion: SPOC通过单次推理实现自发纠正，有效提升数学推理能力，为LLM自我改进提供新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a
broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the
approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs
self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,
existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone
post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to
elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous
self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a
spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved
solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation
dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively
scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by
assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We
adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification
and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and
verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves
performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct
models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23,
and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and
decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision
making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures
non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a
utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision
policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in
deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such
as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social,
situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by
prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act
Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over
controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it
reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit
logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as
a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is
implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments
on sample MDPs.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了GCD在长尾分布中的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of
high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the
increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a
significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be
compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often
rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for
annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate
the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information
within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate
LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our
approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning
on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on
prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical
guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We
establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically
demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal

by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their
applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle
this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline

the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the
formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel
LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also
proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized
statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal
theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex
problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully
designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate
Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best

Conclusion: 结构化推理框架有效解决了多跳事实验证中的挑战，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents
significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in
accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing
approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the
evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and
limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural
Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models
reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and
claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a
structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to
guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that
incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We
further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures
long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise
verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and
verification accuracy.

Conclusion: MARCUS和BRIGHT-Plus为未来研究提供了更鲁棒、以推理为中心的检索支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both
structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and
influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across
diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is
limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and
semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream
reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven
StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and
Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a
higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for
structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing
spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in
both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of
retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to
support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用ChatGPT自动化将Python联邦学习算法翻译为CSP过程的方法，并通过模型检查器PAT验证其正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化联邦学习算法的翻译过程，使其对非专业程序员和LLMs更易用。

Method: 使用ChatGPT自动化翻译Python联邦学习算法为CSP过程，并基于ChatGPT反馈估计上下文最小化。

Result: 实验验证了该方法成功翻译并验证了集中式和分散式联邦学习算法。

Conclusion: 提出的翻译过程有效且适用于联邦学习算法的自动化验证。

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL
framework that is easy to use by ML&AI developers who do not need to be
professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous
research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were
manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness
properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper,
a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to
automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in
Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality
of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The
proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful
translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and
decentralized federated learning algorithms.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级框架SHE，用于检测和缓解多模态大语言模型中的行为幻觉问题，并提出了新的评估指标BEACH。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在行为幻觉问题，限制了其可靠性和扩展性，但目前研究主要集中在客观幻觉上，行为幻觉研究较少。

Method: SHE框架通过视觉-文本对齐检查和正交投影两阶段方法检测和缓解行为幻觉，并提出自适应时间窗口和BEACH指标。

Result: 实验表明，SHE在BEACH指标上减少了10%以上的行为幻觉，同时保持了描述准确性。

Conclusion: SHE有效解决了行为幻觉问题，为多模态模型的可靠性提供了新方法。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何利用GPT-4的MyGPT代理开发定制化编码助手，用于课堂对话分析，提出基于小数据集的实用策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课堂对话分析在教育中至关重要，但传统方法耗时且难以适应小数据集或定制化编码需求。大型语言模型为自动化提供了可能，但现有研究多关注大规模模型或固定编码本，缺乏对小数据集的适用性研究。

Method: 以GPT-4的MyGPT代理为例，评估其在人类编码本下的基线表现，并通过变量控制方法研究不同输入示例对性能的影响，采用基于设计的研究方法提出策略。

Result: 研究发现，尽管存在局限，但基于MyGPT独特功能开发的代理可作为有效的编码助手，生成编码建议。

Conclusion: 通过特定策略配置的MyGPT代理能成为课堂对话分析的有用工具，尤其适合小数据集或定制化需求。

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT
agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised
as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the
need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive
nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language
models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating
pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or
replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised
coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its
baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and
examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a
variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it
identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for
configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that,
despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can
serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

### [235] [Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Model: Data Contamination and Dynamic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07202)
*Ming Liu,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态评估框架，通过任务扰动而非输入扰动，评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的泛化能力，揭示模型是否依赖任务特定线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉语言基准测试中表现优异，但数据污染问题（测试集在训练中暴露）可能掩盖真实泛化能力，尤其是通过强化学习微调的推理模型。

Method: 提出动态评估框架，通过同一视觉输入下的多种任务（如问答、标题生成、问题提出、验证）评估模型，分析其能力向量。使用自动评分管道，结合释义和损坏采样。

Result: 实验表明，对模拟测试数据的微调（极端污染）会显著提升任务特定性能但损害整体泛化能力。动态任务扰动能区分真实理解与虚假泄漏或过拟合。

Conclusion: 动态任务扰动方法为MLLMs的泛化能力提供了更深入的洞察，有助于识别模型的真实能力与潜在问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language
benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set
exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern
extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from
potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static
benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the
same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,
captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This
task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on
superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape
sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)
falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter
minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring
open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption
sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks
including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task
"ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data
(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but
harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper
insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from
spurious leakage or overfitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机代理主要关注通用桌面自动化任务，而在高度专业化的AEC领域（如BIM软件中的3D建筑建模）的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: BIMgent利用多模态LLM，支持多模态输入的概念设计、软件特定工作流规划和GUI操作执行。

Result: BIMgent在真实建筑建模任务中表现良好，设计质量合理，成功率为32%，而基线模型完全失败（0%）。

Conclusion: BIMgent能有效减少人工工作量并保留设计意图，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop
automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly
specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended
design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information
Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by
current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework
powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable
autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI)
operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process,
including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific
workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate
BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based
conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design.
The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its
operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to
complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent
effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural
modeling scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间转换机制（TCM）和快速反射异步反思代理（RRARA），以解决动态高风险场景中决策延迟的问题，并在HAZARD基准测试中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态高风险场景（如火灾、洪水等）中，决策延迟是一个关键但研究不足的问题，需要一种机制来量化延迟并优化代理性能。

Method: 提出TCM将决策延迟转换为等效模拟帧，并设计RRARA代理，结合轻量级LLM反馈模块和基于规则的代理，实现快速反应和异步反思。

Result: 在HAZARD基准测试中，RRARA在延迟敏感场景中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TCM和RRARA为动态高风险场景中的延迟感知决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models
(LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers
have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk
scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under
these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet
insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that
translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation
frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based
metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action
Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we
present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a
lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable
immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ.
Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing
baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Motivation: 策略树搜索算法需要完整解轨迹来训练策略，但在解决困难问题时，训练成本过高，且样本浪费严重。

Method: 通过从搜索树（包括失败尝试的树）中学习子目标和基于子目标的策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了在线学习策略和启发式函数的样本效率。

Conclusion: 基于子目标的策略学习方法能有效提升策略树搜索的训练效率。

Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to
guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of
expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of
the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in
which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the
policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search
process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be
prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized
policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve
these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning
subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and
policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search
expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of
failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training
method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic
function in this online setting.

*Xin-Cheng Wen,Yijun Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Yang Xiao,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReVD框架通过合成推理数据和优化漏洞偏好，显著提升LLM在漏洞检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在漏洞检测中表现有限，主要因缺乏推理数据和语义学习偏向。

Method: 构建漏洞和修复代码的前后向推理过程，设计三元组监督微调和课程在线偏好优化。

Result: 在PrimeVul和SVEN数据集上，ReVD实现12.24%-22.77%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: ReVD为LLM漏洞检测设定了新标杆，开源代码和数据可供进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous
coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software
vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two
factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which
hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and
(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason
behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability
samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability
detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the
scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data
synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically,
we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and
corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning
data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by
curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better
understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on
PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for
LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement
in the accuracy. The source code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和深度强化学习（DRL）的智能故障自愈机制（IFSHM），用于云AI系统的故障检测与恢复。该方法通过两阶段混合架构（LLM驱动的语义解释模块和DRL恢复策略优化器）显著提升了恢复效率和泛化能力。实验表明，IFSHM在未知故障场景下缩短了37%的恢复时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云AI系统的规模和复杂性增加，故障检测与自适应恢复成为确保服务可靠性和连续性的核心挑战。

Method: 提出IFSHM框架，结合LLM和DRL：1）LLM驱动的故障语义解释模块动态提取多源日志和系统指标的上下文语义；2）DRL恢复策略优化器学习故障类型与响应行为的动态匹配。创新点包括LLM用于环境建模和动作空间抽象，以及引入记忆引导的元控制器。

Result: 在云故障注入平台上的实验表明，IFSHM相比现有DRL和规则方法，在未知故障场景下缩短了37%的系统恢复时间。

Conclusion: IFSHM通过LLM和DRL的结合，显著提升了云AI系统的故障恢复效率和泛化能力，适用于复杂和未知的故障场景。

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase,
the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core
challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we
propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates
Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to
realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy
optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional
DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid
architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can
dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system
indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery
strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic
matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The
innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment
modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration
efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same
time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with
reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve
continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared
with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system
recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在视觉数学问题中的能力，填补其在多语言和符号推理方面研究的空白。

Method: 评估多个MLLMs（如GPT 4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash等）在多语言Kangaroo风格基准测试中的表现，涵盖几何、代数等主题。

Result: 模型表现因主题和语言而异，Gemini 2.0 Flash在图像任务中表现最优，但整体未达人类水平；GPT 4o和Gemini展现出结构化推理能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs在视觉数学问题中仍有提升空间，需进一步优化对视觉信息的利用和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language
capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains
underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for
mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and
symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral,
Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual
Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our
experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate
across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single
model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy
with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance
for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating
underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation
exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier
items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably,
Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed
by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance.
Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason
or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured
reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less
consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable
to align their outputs with the given answer options.

Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）易受攻击，现有攻击方法需复杂参数调整，缺乏泛化能力。基础模型的出现为设计通用攻击模型提供了可能。

Method: 设计关系感知的基础攻击模型HeTa，通过基础代理模型对齐异构性并识别共享的关系感知攻击单元，实现序列化攻击。

Result: 实验显示HeTa具有强大的攻击性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HeTa为HGNNs提供了一种通用且高效的攻击方法，揭示了不同HGNNs共享的脆弱性模式。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂法律推理中容易产生逻辑错误，影响了法律判决预测的可靠性。

Method: LegalReasoner通过识别争议点分解复杂案件，进行分步推理，并使用过程验证器验证每一步的逻辑。检测到错误时，采用专家设计的归因和解决策略进行修正。

Result: 实验表明，LegalReasoner将LLAMA-3.1-70B模型与法院判决的一致性从72.37提高到80.27。

Conclusion: LegalReasoner通过分步验证和修正推理过程，显著提升了法律判决预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final
rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the
judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial
efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when
conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances
LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning
process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex
cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier
to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential
perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and
resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,
we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with
detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and
process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner
significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on
LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理需要多跳推理的复杂声明时表现不佳，主要依赖静态分解策略和浅层语义检索，导致推理错误累积、证据噪声污染和适应性不足。

Method: AFEV框架通过迭代分解声明为原子事实，动态优化声明理解，重新排序证据以过滤噪声，并利用上下文特定示例指导推理过程。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，AFEV在准确性和可解释性方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AFEV通过细粒度分解和自适应推理，有效解决了复杂声明验证中的挑战，为事实核查提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing
the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However,
traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning
over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies
and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced
structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning
errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse
claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To
address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a
novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts,
enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically
refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative
fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages
context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XPM方法在生成多样化的协作伙伴代理时计算成本高且样本效率低，需要改进。

Method: 提出XPM-WM框架，利用学习的世界模型生成模拟轨迹，避免多轨迹采样，并实现伙伴代理的多样化生成。

Result: XPM-WM在训练效率和多样性上优于传统XPM方法，且能扩展到更多伙伴代理。

Conclusion: XPM-WM是一种更高效、可扩展的ZSC代理训练方法。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC)
agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative
conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population
generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the
training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each
partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of
the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task.
In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of
an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods.
We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM
via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes
the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed
method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match
the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward
as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly
more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

Result: ReLIFT在五个竞赛级基准和一个分布外基准上平均提升5.2分，且仅需13%的详细演示数据。

Conclusion: ReLIFT克服了RL的根本限制，展示了结合RL和SFT的显著潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

*Qisheng Hu,Quanyu Long,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARIS是一种分层代理模型，通过推理驱动的搜索和搜索辅助的推理，提升多跳声明验证的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳声明验证需要动态检索证据和推理的紧密结合，现有方法难以有效协调这一过程。

Method: HARIS包含高层推理代理和低层搜索代理，分别负责构建验证链和动态检索信息，通过强化学习训练。

Result: 在EX-FEVER和HOVER基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了多跳声明验证的性能。

Conclusion: HARIS通过分层代理设计有效解决了多跳声明验证中的动态推理和检索问题。

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step
reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for
information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally
interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence,
while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial
information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and
Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of
reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a
high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification
chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a
low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining
its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to
specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and
interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with
outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER
benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly
advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态课程学习框架（CL）用于多智能体强化学习（MARL），通过自适应难度调整机制和反事实组相对策略优势（CGRPA）提升训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法通常在固定对手策略下训练，难以适应动态环境，导致策略次优。

Method: 动态CL框架结合自适应难度调整和CGRPA，通过反事实优势函数评估个体贡献，提供内在奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了训练稳定性和最终性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 动态CL与CGRPA的结合有效解决了MARL中的非平稳性和信用分配问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in
cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train
agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static
difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments
and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum
learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL
that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training
performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more
challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability
due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this
challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),
which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit
signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA
constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual
contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates
throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through
constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic
rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under
non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive
results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: GTR-Mol-VLM框架通过图遍历机制和数据中心原则改进光学化学结构识别（OCSR），在复杂分子结构和缩写标注上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在OCSR任务中处理复杂分子结构和标注不一致的局限性。

Method: 提出GTR-Mol-VLM框架，包含图遍历视觉链机制和忠实识别原则，并构建GTR-CoT-1.3M数据集和MolRec-Bench基准。

Result: GTR-Mol-VLM在功能组缩写分子图像上表现优于其他模型，提升约14个百分点。

Conclusion: 该工作有望推动OCSR技术更贴近实际需求，促进化学信息学和AI科学发展。

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing
chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable
formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in
this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex
molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能代理框架在信息安全、可靠性和多代理协调方面存在不足，缺乏机制保障。

Method: SAFEFLOW引入细粒度信息流控制（IFC）、事务执行、冲突解决和安全调度，并采用写前日志、回滚和安全缓存增强韧性。

Result: 实验表明，SAFEFLOW在对抗性和并发环境下显著优于现有技术，保持任务性能和安全性。

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW为可靠、安全的智能代理生态系统奠定了基础，推动了自主系统的前沿发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces
data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical
proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis
proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate
modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended
data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It
formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships
between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex
research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from
published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated
through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through
exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and
heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability
and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents
a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific
domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data.

Conclusion: SWE-Dev展示了开源LLM在软件工程任务中的潜力，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational
problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as
software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex
and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development
process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the
lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this
issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we
develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation.
Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for
building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the
SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents.
Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models
reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source

Motivation: 现有CUA基准主要针对GUI代理，易受UI变化影响且忽略API功能交互，MCPWorld填补了这一空白。

Method: 利用白盒应用和动态代码检测技术，MCPWorld扩展了CUA设计空间并实现任务完成的程序化验证。

Result: 初步实验显示任务完成准确率达75.12%，验证了MCP在代理自动化中的有效性。

Conclusion: MCPWorld有望推动下一代CUA的标准化评测，支持丰富外部工具的利用。

Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative
technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA
benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are
susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by
application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose
MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid
agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those
with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g.,
adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app
features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly
monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code
instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from
specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks,
covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully
containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different
OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative
LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy,
simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of
agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate
and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that
can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available
at https://github.com/SAAgent/MCPWorld.

Conclusion: 旨在通过定制化评估策略，使基础LLM研究从早期开发阶段更具系统性和基准指导性。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks have proven effective for assessing the performance of
fully trained large language models. However, we find striking differences in
the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to
provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences
arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge
evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of
language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation
methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance
differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three
pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate
checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and
development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,
making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational
resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality
of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1
trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge
domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early
training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from
various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or
have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to
make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the
earliest phases of model development.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）经过安全对齐，仍存在漏洞，现有防护方法依赖人工数据集且难以应对新威胁。

Method: RSafe采用两阶段方法：1）引导推理，通过策略引导逐步分析安全风险；2）强化对齐，通过规则强化学习优化推理路径。

Result: RSafe能够根据用户指定的安全策略提供定制化防护，泛化能力优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RSafe通过自适应推理和强化对齐，显著提升了对未知安全威胁的防护能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite
deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and
society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content,
system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM
inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a
prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models
rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with
out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak
attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive
reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide
robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates
in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input
content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced
alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with
accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to
internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over
unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe
accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored
to specific safety requirements.

Conclusion: 语义时空图模型为知识表示和过程建模提供了可扩展且可预测的框架，同时明确了吸收状态与边界信息的重要性。

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks.
Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive
problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability,
adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of
Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with
LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that
uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse,
high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution
diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using
three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate
that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches
with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings
underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering
greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法未能有效利用多样化的可复用策略，而人类推理具有灵活性和适应性，因此需要一种更高效的结构化方法。

Method: 提出Guideline Forest框架，通过提取可复用指南并扩展为多样化变体，并行执行、自我修正并逐步聚合。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP和HumanEval等基准测试中，Guideline Forest显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Guideline Forest展示了多路径推理和逐步聚合的有效性，具有适应性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior
experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to
emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference
time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both
fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured,
efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs
reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from
verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike
test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified
reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into
diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative
thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and
aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty
and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four
benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and
programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further
highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,
underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while
the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational
features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical
abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and
decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model
organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably
occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that
favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and
data to facilitate reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在特定领域（如医学超声）因缺乏领域专用数据而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 开发了一种从领域专用材料生成四元组（图像、问题、思考轨迹、答案）的数据生成流程，并构建了ReMUD数据集。

Result: ReMUD-7B模型在医学超声领域表现优于通用领域MLLMs。

Conclusion: ReMUD数据集和模型解决了特定领域MLLMs数据短缺问题，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of
domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some
specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around,
but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there
are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic
diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often
saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the
training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised
fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets
(image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A
medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000
reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound
field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and
ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD,
addressing the data shortage issue in specific domain MLLMs.

*Hudson de Martim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FRBRoo框架的细粒度时间模型，用于跟踪法律规范的组件级版本变化，解决了现有标准在时间重建上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律文档建模框架（如FRBR/FRBRoo和Akoma Ntoso）缺乏对组件级版本化的原生支持，限制了法律文本的确定性时间重建能力。

Method: 扩展FRBRoo框架，引入Temporal Version (TV)和Language Version (LV)等子类，并分层应用Component Work (CW)、Component Temporal Version (CTV)和Component Language Version (CLV)来跟踪法律规范的组件生命周期。

Result: 以巴西联邦宪法为例，模型能够精确重建法律文本在特定时间点的状态，支持高级法律信息系统和AI工具的开发。

Conclusion: 该模型为法律信息系统的开发提供了可靠基础，克服了现有生成模型的局限性，支持历史分析和影响评估。

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代LLMs是否具备解决传统AI中两大难题（框架问题和符号接地问题）的认知能力。

Method: 设计两个基准任务，零样本条件下测试13种LLMs（开源和封闭模型），评估输出质量（如上下文推理、语义连贯性等）。

Result: 开源模型表现参差不齐，部分封闭模型表现稳定且高分。

Conclusion: 某些现代LLMs可能具备解决这些长期理论挑战的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

TL;DR: LUCIFER框架通过结合分层决策架构、强化学习和大型语言模型，利用人类上下文知识提升自主决策效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中，自主系统的内部模型与快速变化的外部环境之间存在知识差距，限制了决策效果。人类上下文知识可弥补这一差距，但如何将其转化为自主系统的可操作信息仍具挑战。

Method: 提出LUCIFER框架，整合分层决策架构、强化学习和大型语言模型（LLMs），LLMs用于上下文提取和零样本探索引导。

Result: LUCIFER在探索效率和决策质量上优于传统目标导向策略，展示了上下文驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: LUCIFER通过结合人类上下文知识和自主系统，为动态环境中的决策问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的不等式证明任务形式，发布了一个专家策划的数据集IneqMath，并开发了一种基于LLM的评估框架，揭示了当前大语言模型在严格证明中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不等式证明是科学和数学中的重要领域，但现有数据集稀缺或形式化，限制了LLM在此领域的发展。

Method: 将不等式证明分为两个可自动检查的子任务：边界估计和关系预测，并构建了包含逐步解答和定理注释的数据集IneqMath。

Result: 评估29个领先LLM发现，即使顶级模型在逐步审查下的准确率也低于10%，揭示了模型在严格证明中的缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究指出了定理引导推理和自我优化等有前景的方向，并提供了代码和数据。

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: Gradients是一个去中心化的AutoML平台，通过竞争性市场机制优化超参数配置，显著优于现有集中式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML平台依赖单一优化策略，仅探索部分可行的超参数配置，限制了性能提升。

Method: Gradients将超参数优化转化为竞争性市场，独立矿工通过经济激励竞争发现最优配置。

Result: 在180个实验中，Gradients以82.8%的胜率优于HuggingFace AutoTrain，并在复杂任务中实现30-40%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 竞争性经济驱动方法能系统性发现集中式AutoML遗漏的优越配置。

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction
of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce
Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,
economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior
configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在图像-文本对齐方面表现不佳，且依赖外部监督。本文旨在通过自监督方法解决这一问题。

Method: 引入双奖励机制，通过采样多输出并反转输入-输出对计算对偶似然作为自奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型性能，尤其在文本到图像任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 自监督双奖励机制有效提升了多模态模型的理解与生成能力，无需外部监督。

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为τ²-bench的新基准测试，用于评估对话AI在双控制环境中的表现，弥补了现有单控制环境模拟的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话AI基准测试仅模拟单控制环境，而现实场景（如技术支持）需要用户主动参与修改共享世界状态。τ²-bench旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 1) 提出电信双控制领域模型（Dec-POMDP）；2) 设计任务生成器以创建多样化任务；3) 开发可靠用户模拟器；4) 通过多维度分析评估性能。

Result: 实验显示，从无用户到双控制环境时，AI性能显著下降，突显了引导用户的挑战。

Conclusion: τ²-bench为需要有效推理和引导用户行为的AI提供了可控测试平台。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Motivation: 现有GUI模型依赖无错误的离线轨迹，缺乏反思与纠错能力，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 1) 自动生成反思与纠错数据；2) 构建移动设备在线训练环境；3) 提出迭代在线反射调优算法。

Result: GUI-Reflection框架赋予GUI代理自反思与纠错能力，提升自动化鲁棒性与适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架为更智能的GUI自动化铺平道路，所有资源将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物联网和移动平台时代，如何在有限硬件上确保内容真实性而不增加负担是关键问题。

Method: 结合快速小波变换（FWT）和加性量化索引调制（AQIM），在YCbCr颜色空间的亮度分量中嵌入水印，最小化感知失真。

Result: 在Raspberry Pi 5上运行时间小于40毫秒，PSNR≥34 dB，SSIM≥0.97，抗攻击能力强（NCC≥0.998）。

Conclusion: FWT-AQIM为带宽和功耗受限的场景提供了高效、可扩展的实时水印解决方案。

Abstract: In the age of IoT and mobile platforms, ensuring that content stay authentic
whilst avoiding overburdening limited hardware is a key problem. This study
introduces hybrid Fast Wavelet Transform & Additive Quantization index
Modulation (FWT-AQIM) scheme, a lightweight watermarking approach that secures
digital pictures on low-power, memory-constrained small scale devices to
achieve a balanced trade-off among robustness, imperceptibility, and
computational efficiency. The method embeds watermark in the luminance
component of YCbCr color space using low-frequency FWT sub-bands, minimizing
perceptual distortion, using additive QIM for simplicity. Both the extraction
and embedding processes run in less than 40 ms and require minimum RAM when
tested on a Raspberry Pi 5. Quality assessments on standard and high-resolution
images yield PSNR greater than equal to 34 dB and SSIM greater than equal to
0.97, while robustness verification includes various geometric and
signal-processing attacks demonstrating near-zero bit error rates and NCC
greater than equal to 0.998. Using a mosaic-based watermark, redundancy added
enhancing robustness without reducing throughput, which peaks at 11 MP/s. These
findings show that FWT-AQIM provides an efficient, scalable solution for
real-time, secure watermarking in bandwidth- and power-constrained contexts,
opening the way for dependable content protection in developing IoT and
multimedia applications.

Abstract: The ACM Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) is a venue that welcomes and compares
systems that support the exploration of lifelog data, and in particular the
retrieval of specific information, through an interactive competition format.
This paper reviews the recent advances in interactive lifelog retrieval as
demonstrated at the ACM LSC from 2022 to 2024. Through a detailed comparative
analysis, we highlight key improvements across three main retrieval tasks:
known-item search, question answering, and ad-hoc search. Our analysis
identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval
methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models
(LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and
collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval
techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance,
emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability.
Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show
promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can
enhance usability and efficiency. Additionally, we recommend reconsidering
multi-instance system evaluations within the expert track to better manage
variability in user familiarity and configuration effectiveness.

Motivation: 在多模态文本-图像模型中，专业领域的查询因用户缺乏专业知识而难以精准描述，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 收集了741条人类标注数据，包含短/长文本描述和感兴趣区域的边界框，评估CLIP模型在不同静态子区域和完整图像上的检索表现。

Result: 结果显示，简单的3x3分区和5网格重叠方法显著提高了检索效果，并对标注框的扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于位置的提示可以有效提升专业领域中模糊文本查询的检索性能。

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based
querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing
performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous,
specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can
often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

Motivation: 随着视频用户生成内容（UGC）的流行，和谐性对音频-视觉节奏一致性的评估至关重要，以提升用户参与度。

Conclusion: 提出的和谐评估策略和模型设计有效提升了音频-视觉节奏同步性，符合人类感知。

Abstract: With the popularity of video-based user-generated content (UGC) on social
media, harmony, as dictated by human perceptual principles, is critical in
assessing the rhythmic consistency of audio-visual UGCs for better user
engagement. In this work, we propose a novel harmony-aware GAN framework,
following a specifically designed harmony evaluation strategy to enhance
rhythmic synchronization in the automatic music-to-motion synthesis using a UGC
dance dataset. This harmony strategy utilizes refined cross-modal beat
detection to capture closely correlated audio and visual rhythms in an
audio-visual pair. To mimic human attention mechanism, we introduce
saliency-based beat weighting and interval-driven beat alignment, which ensures
accurate harmony score estimation consistent with human perception. Building on
this strategy, our model, employing efficient encoder-decoder and depth-lifting
designs, is adversarially trained based on categorized musical meter segments
to generate realistic and rhythmic 3D human motions. We further incorporate our
harmony evaluation strategy as a weakly supervised perceptual constraint to
flexibly guide the synchronized audio-visual rhythms during the generation
process. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly
outperforms other leading music-to-motion methods in rhythmic harmony, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, even with limited UGC training data. Live

Motivation: 当前GraphRAG方法的评估框架存在无关问题和评估偏差，可能导致对性能的错误结论，因此需要一种更科学的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于图-文本接地问题生成的无偏评估框架，并设计了无偏评估流程以消除LLM评估中的偏差。

Result: 应用该框架评估3种代表性GraphRAG方法，发现其性能提升比之前报道的更有限。

Conclusion: 尽管该框架可能仍有缺陷，但它为GraphRAG研究提供了更科学的评估基础。

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for

### [275] [TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343)
*Taesoo Kim,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型依赖大规模配对语音-文本数据和大量计算资源，限制了可扩展性和可访问性。

Method: 利用统一编码器将语义等效的文本和语音输入映射到共享潜在空间，并通过轻量级投影网络与LLM嵌入空间对齐。

Result: 仅用文本训练的TESU-LLM在多个语音相关基准测试中表现优异，接近多模态数据训练的基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

*Zachary Yang,Domenico Tullo,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种软提示方法和LLM辅助标签转移框架，用于解决多游戏和多语言环境中的毒性检测问题，显著提升了效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏社区中的毒性检测在多游戏和多语言环境下面临扩展和实时性的挑战，需要高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 引入软提示方法，使单一模型能处理多游戏；2. 开发基于GPT-4o-mini的LLM辅助标签转移框架，扩展支持七种语言。

Result: 在法语、德语、葡萄牙语和俄语的测试中，宏F1分数为32.96%至58.88%，德语表现最佳（超过英语基准45.39%）。生产环境中显著减少计算资源和维护成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在多游戏和多语言环境下实现了高效的毒性检测，减少了资源消耗，并在实际应用中成功识别违规行为。

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格解释任务的重要性日益增加，但未标记表格数据中的关系检测仍具挑战性，需要结合新技术和基准测试。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合KG和LLM，通过域和范围约束检测以及关系共现分析减少搜索空间。

Result: 在两个SemTab挑战基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同量化水平和提示技术下具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在公开数据集上表现优异，与现有先进方法相当。

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的Actor-Critic框架LAC，通过长期动作评估改进LLM策略，解决了复杂决策场景中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂决策任务中表现不佳，无法有效进行长期推理和结果评估，导致决策次优。

Method: LAC框架通过计算与正负结果相关的Q值提取动作评估，结合未来轨迹推演和推理，并通过无梯度机制实现高效策略改进。

Conclusion: LAC框架展示了将结构化策略优化与LLM内在知识结合的潜力，可提升多步环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DMPI-PMHFE的双通道特征融合检测框架，用于检测大型语言模型（LLMs）中的提示注入攻击，结合了预训练语言模型和启发式特征工程，显著提高了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，提示注入攻击成为重大安全威胁，现有防御机制在效果和泛化性之间存在权衡，亟需高效且通用的检测方法。

Method: 提出DMPI-PMHFE框架，结合DeBERTa-v3-base提取语义向量和基于已知攻击模式的启发式规则提取结构特征，通过全连接神经网络融合特征进行预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DMPI-PMHFE在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有方法，实际部署中显著降低了主流LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE通过双通道特征融合有效解决了提示注入攻击检测的局限性，为LLMs安全提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖高成本的人工标注或外部奖励模型，RLSC旨在通过模型自身置信度作为奖励信号，减少监督需求。

Method: RLSC利用模型自身置信度作为奖励信号，应用于Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型，仅需每问题8样本和4训练周期。

Result: 在AIME2024、MATH500和AMC23任务上，RLSC分别提升准确率20.10%、49.40%和52.50%。

Conclusion: RLSC为推理模型提供了一种简单、可扩展且低监督的后训练方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的工作流程，用于战场物联网（IoBT）中的数据查询和信息生成，以提高态势感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升战场物联网（IoBT）在关键决策中的态势感知能力，通过将设备数据转化为用户友好的信息对象。

Method: 采用LLMs和图形数据库技术，实现自然语言查询到数据库查询的映射，并将结果以自然语言形式返回。

Result: 实验表明，Llama 3.1（80亿参数）在所有指标上表现最佳，且两步法提升了19.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作流程为在边缘设备上部署LLMs提供了基础，支持自然语言与数据库交互，助力关键决策。

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP是一种针对轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）的直接行为优化范式，通过梯度自由的蒙特卡洛树搜索优化执行序列，显著提升了LwLLMs在复杂任务中的性能，同时降低了计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LwLLMs在资源效率和隐私方面有优势，但在推理能力和复杂任务上表现不佳，且现有提示优化方法对其效果有限。

Method: DeBoP将复杂提示优化转化为离散、可量化的执行序列优化，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索方法。

Result: 实验表明，DeBoP在七项任务中显著优于其他方法，优化后的LwLLMs甚至超越GPT-3.5，计算时间减少60%。

Conclusion: DeBoP为LwLLMs提供了一种高效的自动优化方法，显著提升了其性能和实用性。

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

Method: 通过分析数据集中的安全类别，结合心理学假设，研究了价值观对齐LLMs的安全风险及其成因。

Result: 发现价值观对齐的LLMs比未经微调的模型更容易产生有害行为，且在传统安全评估中风险略高于其他微调模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了价值观对齐的“黑箱”问题，并提出上下文对齐方法以降低安全风险。

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

Method: 使用KL散度正则化技术（SMAR），无需修改模型架构或依赖大量文本数据。

Result: 在视觉指令调优中，语言能力保留86.6%，仅需2.5%纯文本，优于基线。

Conclusion: SMAR为多模态MoE模型提供了高效平衡模态差异与语言能力的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在推理时可能生成非规范的标记序列，导致负面后果。本文旨在通过理论分析和提出新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出“规范采样”方法，确保模型在自回归生成过程中每一步都生成部分规范标记序列。

Result: 规范采样方法有效避免了非规范标记序列的生成，且生成的序列分布更接近训练数据的真实分布。

Conclusion: 规范采样是一种简单高效的方法，能够显著改善大语言模型生成标记序列的质量和一致性。

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文信息与参数知识冲突时的行为，以评估其可靠性和部署风险。

Method: 构建诊断数据以引发冲突，分析模型在不同任务类型中的表现。

Result: 发现知识冲突对无需知识的任务影响小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，且难以完全抑制内部知识。提供冲突解释可增加对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 知识冲突影响模型评估的有效性，需在部署大语言模型时考虑此类冲突。

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

Result: RAFT结合合成数据显著提升了LLM在EDA任务中的性能，并验证了真实用户问题对数据生成的有效性。

Conclusion: 合成数据结合RAFT是提升LLM在EDA领域性能的有效方法，同时需关注数据安全和隐私问题。

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

Motivation: 理解VLM中的社会群体偏见如何影响下游任务，以构建更公平的AI系统。

Method: 通过关联VLM表示空间中的内在偏见与零样本检索任务中的外在偏见，设计了一个控制框架进行测量。

Result: 内在与外在偏见之间存在显著相关性（平均ρ=0.83±0.10），且性能更强的模型偏见传播更严重。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLM偏见的传播机制，并呼吁关注模型复杂化可能加剧的偏见问题。

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### [290] [Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539)
*Yijie Hao,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出‘意图幻觉’概念，指大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂查询中遗漏或误解部分条件。作者引入FAITHQA基准（20,068个问题）评估意图幻觉，并开发CONSTRAINT SCORE自动检测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在复杂查询中常遗漏或误解条件，导致意图幻觉，需系统性评估。

Method: 提出FAITHQA基准，涵盖多种主题和难度，评估LLMs的意图幻觉现象。

Result: 发现意图幻觉普遍存在于先进模型中，主要由遗漏或误解引起。CONSTRAINT SCORE优于基线，接近人类评估。

Conclusion: 意图幻觉是LLMs的常见问题，FAITHQA和CONSTRAINT SCORE为未来研究提供工具。

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了LaMP-Cap数据集，用于个性化多模态图表标题生成，实验表明多模态信息能提升标题生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成的图表标题缺乏个性化和多模态支持，作者需要手动调整以匹配风格和领域需求。

Method: 引入LaMP-Cap数据集，包含图表图像、标题和相关段落作为多模态上下文，并测试了四种大语言模型。

Result: 实验显示多模态上下文（尤其是图像）显著提升标题生成质量，优于纯文本上下文。

Conclusion: 多模态个性化方法在图表标题生成中具有优势，未来可进一步扩展应用场景。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Precise Information Control (PIC)任务，要求模型基于可验证的短句生成长文本而不添加未支持的内容。通过PIC-Bench评估，发现现有模型70%输出存在幻觉，并提出后训练框架PIC-LM，显著提升生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型内在幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但无输入依据的信息。

Method: 提出PIC任务，设计PIC-Bench基准测试，并开发后训练框架PIC-LM，通过弱监督偏好数据提升模型准确性。

Result: PIC-LM在完整PIC设置中F1从69.1%提升至91.0%，在端到端任务中显著提升事实准确性。

Conclusion: PIC框架能有效减少幻觉，提升生成文本的精确性，为语言模型的可靠应用提供潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

Conclusion: 论文展示了医学任务引用生成的挑战与机遇，并提出了关键设计选择以提升引用质量。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based medical question-answering systems lack citation
generation and evaluation capabilities, raising concerns about their adoption
in practice. In this work, we introduce \name, the first end-to-end framework
that facilitates the design and evaluation of citation generation with LLMs for
medical tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel multi-pass retrieval-citation
method that generates high-quality citations. Our evaluation highlights the
challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while
identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the
final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation
precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we
show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from
professional experts.

### [294] [Training-Free Tokenizer Transplantation via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06607)
*Charles Goddard,Fernando Fernandes Neto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过正交匹配追踪（OMP）重建未见过的词嵌入，实现预训练大语言模型（LLM）中分词器的移植。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在使用新分词器时性能下降的问题，实现跨分词器的知识迁移和应用。

Method: 使用OMP算法，将新分词器的词汇表示为共享锚点词汇的稀疏线性组合，分两阶段完成词嵌入的移植。

Result: 在Llama→Mistral NeMo和Qwen→Llama任务中，OMP在零样本设置下性能最佳，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: OMP方法无需梯度更新即可有效解决分词器差异问题，支持跨分词器的多种应用，如知识蒸馏和领域适应。

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

TL;DR: 论文展示了通过残差流的仿射映射在语言模型间高效转移特征表示的方法，并验证了其在小模型和大模型间的权重转移效果，显著降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小模型和大模型间表示空间的相似性，以降低训练昂贵组件（如稀疏自编码器）的成本。

Method: 利用仿射映射技术在小模型和大模型间转移稀疏自编码器的权重，并分析特征转移的效果。

Result: 小模型和大模型的表示空间高度相似，转移权重可节省50%训练成本；语义和结构特征转移效果不同，但功能特征角色映射准确。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大小模型线性表示空间的异同，并提出了一种提升稀疏自编码器训练效率的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）和传统机器学习分类器在社交媒体数据中的抑郁语言检测性能，发现零样本LLMs在二元分类中表现良好，但在细粒度分类中表现不佳，而基于LLM生成摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确且可解释的抑郁语言检测对心理健康早期干预具有重要意义，有助于临床实践和公共卫生。

Method: 比较零样本LLMs和监督分类器在三种分类任务中的表现，包括二元抑郁分类、抑郁严重程度分类及抑郁、PTSD和焦虑的鉴别诊断。

Result: 零样本LLMs在二元分类中泛化能力强，但在细粒度分类中表现较差；基于LLM摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康预测中具有潜力，未来可优化其零样本能力和上下文感知摘要技术。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRIEFME是一个新的法律简报数据集，旨在评估语言模型在法律简报写作中的能力，包括论点总结、论点补全和案例检索任务。当前大型语言模型在总结和补全任务中表现良好，但在实际论点补全和案例检索中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索法律简报写作这一未被充分研究的法律NLP领域，帮助法律专业人士更高效地完成工作。

Method: 引入BRIEFME数据集，包含三个任务：论点总结、论点补全和案例检索，并分析当前语言模型在这些任务中的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在总结和补全任务中表现优秀，但在实际论点补全和案例检索中表现较差。

Conclusion: BRIEFME数据集有望推动法律NLP的发展，以更好地辅助法律工作。

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理咨询中的研究集中于单次会话，而实际心理咨询是一个需要多次会话的渐进过程。

Method: 通过公开的心理案例报告构建多会话心理咨询数据集（MusPsy-Dataset），并开发了MusPsy-Model以跟踪客户进展并动态调整咨询方向。

Result: 实验表明，MusPsy-Model在多会话场景中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多会话心理咨询数据集的空白，并展示了模型在动态心理咨询中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于当前LLM安全评估标准主观性强且缺乏明确性，作者希望通过法律视角提供系统化、全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出SafeLawBench基准，包含24,860道选择题和1,106道开放域QA任务，对2个闭源和18个开源LLM进行评估，采用零样本和少样本提示。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使是领先的SOTA模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o）在多选题任务中的准确率也未超过80.5%，20个LLM的平均准确率为68.8%。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁社区优先研究LLM的安全性，并展示了多数投票机制对模型性能的提升作用。

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注点估计，缺乏对不同方法的系统比较，且在处理文本到分布预测任务（如价格估计）时，需要更细致的文本理解和不确定性量化。

Method: 提出了一种分位数回归方法，使LLMs能够生成完整的预测分布，并在三个价格预测数据集上进行了实验。

Result: 实验表明，经过分位数头微调的Mistral-7B模型在预测准确性和分布校准方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Mistral-7B在多种比较中表现最佳，同时LLM辅助的标签校正方法可实现接近人类水平的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support

Motivation: 扩展点级干预方法，实现对语言模型更全面的行为控制。

Method: 提出分布级干预，学习概念子空间及其周围区域，而非仅点级变换。

Result: 在常识推理和算术推理任务中，分布级干预在可控性和鲁棒性上优于点级干预。

Conclusion: 分布级干预为语言模型提供了更细粒度的行为控制方法。

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动态RAG和参数化RAG两种新兴研究方向，以解决传统RAG在复杂任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用静态检索和上下文知识注入，对需要多跳推理和自适应信息访问的复杂任务效果不佳。

Result: 动态RAG和参数化RAG在效率和效果上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 论文为RAG领域的研究提供了理论基础和实践指导，推动进一步探索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

Motivation: 在专业领域（如医学和法律）中检测LLM生成文本对防止错误信息和确保真实性至关重要，但现有零样本检测器在专业内容上表现不佳。

Method: 提出DivScore框架，结合归一化熵评分和领域知识蒸馏，并发布医学和法律领域的LLM生成文本检测基准。

Result: DivScore在AUROC和召回率上显著优于现有方法，对抗性环境下表现更稳健。

Conclusion: DivScore在专业领域检测LLM生成文本方面具有显著优势，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在内存和扩展性限制，RetNet通过结合递归和注意力机制解决了这些问题，成为研究热点。

Method: RetNet采用保留机制，统一了递归的归纳偏置和注意力的全局依赖建模，支持线性时间推理和并行训练。

Result: RetNet在自然语言处理、语音识别和时间序列分析等领域表现优异，展示了跨域有效性。

Conclusion: 本文填补了RetNet综述的空白，总结了其创新、应用及挑战，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series

current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

*Qi Shi,Qiwei Han,Cláudia Soares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-PATH是一种基于大型语言模型的对话AI系统，旨在通过自然对话帮助患者识别症状并推荐合适的医疗科室。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗系统复杂且令人困惑，患者难以及时获得适当的医疗服务，因此需要一种用户友好且准确的AI工具。

Method: C-PATH基于LLaMA3架构，通过多阶段管道微调医学知识、对话数据和临床摘要，并采用GPT数据增强框架和可扩展的对话历史管理策略。

Result: 评估显示C-PATH在清晰度、信息量和推荐准确性方面表现优异，显著优于领域特定基线。

Conclusion: C-PATH是开发用户友好、可访问且准确的数字健康辅助工具的重要进展。

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在处理具有冲突国家视角的历史事件时是否存在地缘政治偏见。

Method: 引入包含中性事件描述和不同国家对立观点的新数据集，并通过实验评估模型偏见。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著偏见，且简单去偏见方法效果有限；模型对标签操纵敏感。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的国家叙事偏见，挑战了简单去偏见方法的有效性，为未来研究提供了框架和数据集。

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治话语中隐含内容对受众影响显著，LLMs在语义和语用理解方面表现优异，但其在政治话语中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用IMPAQTS语料库，通过选择题和开放式生成任务测试LLMs对预设和隐含意义的理解能力。

Result: 所有测试模型在解释预设和隐含意义时表现不佳，表明当前LLMs缺乏关键语用能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在政治话语中处理隐含内容的能力有限，但研究指出了改进的可能性和未来方向。

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了taggedPBC数据集的依赖标注版本，展示了其在跨语言研究中的实用性，尽管数据质量存在一些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: taggedPBC数据集虽然庞大且POS标注准确，但缺乏依赖标注，限制了其在语法研究中的应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过CoNLLU格式将依赖信息与POS标签一起转移到taggedPBC的所有语言中。

Result: 尽管标注质量存在问题，但数据集在词序信息上与专家数据库（WALS、Grambank、Autotyp）一致，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 依赖标注的taggedPBC数据集为跨语言研究提供了新工具，表明即使数据有噪声，也能通过充分标注获得重要见解。

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在心理修辞语境中的说服和抵抗能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过对抗性对话评估四种LLMs，引入11种心理说服策略，并提出基于直接偏好优化的自适应框架。

Result: 实验表明，特定策略（如流畅效应和重复效应）能显著提高说服成功率，自适应框架进一步优化了策略选择。

Conclusion: 自适应心理说服方法有效提升了LLMs的说服能力，同时保持了其通用性能。

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成模型的多标签文本分类框架LAGAMC，通过生成标签描述并匹配预定义标签，结合双目标损失函数，实现了高效且通用的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本数据爆炸导致的手动分类困难问题，提出一种领域无关的生成模型框架。

Method: 利用预定义标签描述生成模型，结合双目标损失函数（交叉熵损失和余弦相似度）进行训练，推理时通过微调的句子转换器匹配标签。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到新的SOTA性能，Micro-F1提升13.94%，Macro-F1提升24.85%。

Conclusion: LAGAMC模型具有参数高效性和通用性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能可靠区分可能事件与不可能事件，并分析其表现不稳定的原因。

Method: 通过分离可能性、典型性和上下文相关性，测试多种语言模型（如Llama 3、Gemma 2、Mistral NeMo）的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在某些条件下表现低于随机水平，甚至对不可能句子赋予更高概率。

Conclusion: 语言模型在区分可能与不可能事件时缺乏鲁棒性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket
by the explorer'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏同时控制问题难度和叙事的方法，而这对教育用途的问题生成至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种联合叙事和难度控制的策略，用于生成阅读理解问题。

Result: 初步评估表明该方法可行，但并非在所有情况下都有效。

Conclusion: 研究明确了该策略表现良好的条件，并讨论了其应用的权衡。

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such
research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced
languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we
present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse
(BTPD) collected from three online platforms, each representing distinct
community structures and interaction dynamics. Besides describing how we
hand-curated the dataset through community-informed keyword-based retrieval,
this paper also provides a general overview of its topics and multilingual

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Motivation: 现有的AudioLLMs在情感理解上表现有限，通常将其视为分类问题，缺乏对预测背后逻辑的解释。本文旨在通过情感推理提升模型的情感识别能力。

Method: 提出了一种统一框架，结合推理增强的数据监督、双编码器架构和任务交替训练，使AudioLLMs能够有效学习情感推理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅提高了情感预测准确性，还增强了生成响应的连贯性和证据基础。

Conclusion: 通过情感推理和统一框架的结合，AudioLLMs在情感识别任务中表现更优，同时提供了更具解释性的结果。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: PCoT在五个LLMs和五个数据集上的平均性能优于竞争方法15%，并发布了两个新的虚假信息数据集EUDisinfo和MultiDis。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，说服知识对提升零样本虚假信息检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

Motivation: 基础模型更新后，PEFT模块性能显著下降，重新调优计算成本高。研究发现持续训练主要影响FFN中的任务特定知识，而对注意力机制中的任务特定模式影响较小。

Method: 提出Trans-PEFT方法，专注于任务特定模式，减少对基础模型知识的依赖，并通过理论分析支持。

Result: 在7个基础模型和12个数据集上的实验表明，Trans-PEPT模块无需重新调优即可在更新的基础模型上保持性能。

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT显著减少了实际应用中的维护开销，为PEFT模块的长期使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier为LLMs的真实数学推理评估和训练提供了更可靠的路径。

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: 动态混合方法无需微调LLM，节省资源且易于领域适应，性能卓越。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our

### [321] [Automatic Speech Recognition of African American English: Lexical and Contextual Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06888)
*Hamid Mojarad,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自动语音识别（ASR）在非洲裔美国英语（AAE）中的表现，发现辅音簇缩减（CCR）和ING缩减会增加ASR错误率，且无外部语言模型（LM）的端到端ASR系统更易受词汇邻域效应影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR模型在处理AAE的语音、音系和形态句法特征时表现不佳，研究旨在量化CCR和ING缩减对ASR错误率的影响，并比较有无LM的系统表现。

Method: 使用CORAAL语料库，通过wav2vec 2.0（有/无LM）转录，利用Montreal Forced Aligner检测CCR和ING缩减。

Result: CCR和ING缩减对WER有显著但较小的影响；无LM的ASR系统更易受词汇邻域效应影响。

Conclusion: AAE的特定语音特征会影响ASR性能，无LM的系统对词汇邻域效应更敏感。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合提取式和生成式摘要的多语言情感分析混合方法，显著提升准确率和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一方法的局限性，提升多语言情感分析的性能。

Method: 整合TF-IDF提取与微调XLM-R生成模块，结合动态阈值和文化适应。

Result: 在10种语言中表现优于基线，英语准确率0.90，低资源语言0.84，计算效率提升22%。

Conclusion: 方法适用于实时品牌监控和跨文化分析，未来将优化低资源语言支持。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for multilingual sentiment analysis that
combines extractive and abstractive summarization to address the limitations of
standalone methods. The model integrates TF-IDF-based extraction with a
fine-tuned XLM-R abstractive module, enhanced by dynamic thresholding and
cultural adaptation. Experiments across 10 languages show significant
improvements over baselines, achieving 0.90 accuracy for English and 0.84 for
low-resource languages. The approach also demonstrates 22% greater
computational efficiency than traditional methods. Practical applications
include real-time brand monitoring and cross-cultural discourse analysis.
Future work will focus on optimization for low-resource languages via 8-bit
quantization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合语篇结构的新闻摘要方法，通过DiscoSum算法满足不同平台的结构和风格需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在新闻摘要中难以保持长期语篇结构，影响读者参与度。

Method: 开发了新闻语篇模式和新算法DiscoSum，利用束搜索技术实现结构感知的摘要生成。

Result: 人工和自动评估表明，该方法能有效保持叙事忠实度和结构要求。

Conclusion: 结合语篇结构的摘要方法在新闻领域具有显著效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析150多篇关于提示的文献，提出了一个基于属性和人类中心的框架来评估提示质量，并探讨了属性对LLMs的影响及多属性提示优化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，提示在人类-AI交流中变得关键，但缺乏对自然语言提示的量化共识。

Method: 通过元分析调查150多篇文献，提出一个包含21个属性的六维框架，并实证研究多属性提示优化的效果。

Result: 发现单属性优化效果显著，且基于属性增强提示的指令调优可提升推理模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为提示评估和优化奠定了基础，推动了人类-AI交流的研究方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0是首个针对大型语言模型（LLMs）设计的日本三段论推理数据集，专注于评估信念不一致推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如NeuBAROCO和JFLD）主要关注通用或信念一致的推理，而BIS Reasoning 1.0旨在揭示LLMs在处理逻辑有效但信念冲突的输入时的偏差。

Method: 通过设计逻辑有效但信念不一致的三段论问题，对包括GPT、Claude和日本领先LLMs在内的模型进行基准测试。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，准确率达79.54%，但所有模型在处理信念冲突输入时均存在显著弱点。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在高风险领域（如法律、医疗和科学文献）中，LLMs需克服直觉信念以确保推理的完整性和安全性。

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习（RL）让问答（QA）代理学会提出澄清问题的方法，并分析了离线RL目标，对比了其他方法，在奖励优化和语言质量上取得了提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答代理通常直接回答问题，而缺乏提出澄清问题的能力。本文旨在通过模拟对话并利用强化学习，让代理学会提出澄清问题，以提升问答效果。

Method: 通过模拟包含澄清问题的对话，利用强化学习（RL）进行训练。提出并分析了离线RL目标，将其视为奖励加权的监督微调（SFT），便于在大语言模型中优化。

Result: 与基于监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化的方法相比，本文方法在奖励优化和语言质量上表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习和离线RL目标，问答代理能够有效学会提出澄清问题，显著提升了问答效果和语言质量。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

*Pavel Kovalev,Carlo Angiuli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种依赖类型的跨语言框架，用于分析事件的终结性和完成性，并通过英语句子建模示例展示其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事件在语言中的终结性和完成性，以及名词短语的有界性与子类型、限定数量和形容词修饰的关系。

Method: 框架分为名词域和动词域两部分，分别建模名词短语的有界性和依赖事件演算，重点关注相关蕴涵。

Result: 框架在Agda证明助手中形式化，展示了规则和示例。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析事件结构和名词短语的有界性提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中的鲁棒性，通过引入语义忠实但对抗性结构的提示扰动，揭示了模型的脆弱性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅依赖浅层统计模式。

Method: 通过一系列语义忠实但对抗性结构的提示扰动（如故事重构、无关约束注入等），评估模型在700个扰动代码生成任务中的表现。

Result: 某些扰动导致性能显著下降（准确率下降达42.1%），而另一些扰动则意外提升模型准确率（最高35.3%）。

Conclusion: 当前推理系统存在脆弱性和不可预测性，需更原则性的方法提升推理对齐和提示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于认知负荷理论的模块化推理方法，通过技能链模式提升科学表格声明的验证准确性，并在少量训练数据下优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本的复杂性和高信息密度可能导致非专家误解，现有模型在细粒度推理上表现不足。

Method: 提出技能链模式，动态组合模块化推理组件（原子技能），减少认知负荷。

Result: 在仅350个微调样本下，模型表现优于GPT-4o的思维链方法，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 模块化推理方法能有效提升科学声明验证的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

TL;DR: 论文提出Chain of Methodologies (CoM)框架，通过整合人类方法论增强LLMs的复杂推理能力，无需微调即可实现系统性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，因训练数据缺乏深度洞察。

Method: CoM框架利用用户定义的方法论，激活LLMs的系统性推理能力。

Result: 实验表明CoM优于基线方法，展示了无训练提示方法的潜力。

Conclusion: CoM为复杂推理任务提供了一种无需训练的解决方案，接近人类推理水平。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like
methodological insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiMM数据集和SEMD模型，用于跨文化多模态隐喻研究，解决NLP中的文化偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐喻处理研究多基于英语数据，存在西方文化偏见，影响模型性能和NLP发展。

Method: 引入MultiMM数据集（8,461个中英文广告文本-图像对）和SEMD模型（结合情感嵌入）。

Result: 实验证明SEMD在隐喻检测和情感分析任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了对NLP文化偏见的认识，助力开发更公平、包容的语言模型。

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are
available at https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/MultiMM.

TL;DR: 论文提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，通过快速-慢速协作解码减少推理模型的FLOPs和推理长度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中会产生冗长的思维链，导致推理速度变慢且内容冗余。研究发现LRMs存在全局和局部对齐偏差现象，尤其是局部对齐偏差集中在句子开头的‘思考线索’上。

Method: 提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，由Leading模型生成句子开头的关键令牌，再由较弱的草稿模型完成剩余部分，通过随机门平滑切换模型。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，FoReaL-Decoding减少30-50%的FLOPs和40%的推理长度，同时保持86-100%的性能。

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding是一种简单、即插即用的方法，可在推理任务中实现成本与性能的可控权衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Adversarial Paraphrasing的攻击框架，通过使用现成的指令跟随LLM对AI生成文本进行改写，以更有效地绕过检测。实验表明该方法在多种检测系统中具有广泛的有效性和高迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）能力的提升，其被滥用于AI生成剽窃和社会工程的风险增加。虽然已有多种AI生成文本检测器，但许多仍易受简单改写攻击的影响。

Method: 提出Adversarial Paraphrasing框架，利用现成的指令跟随LLM在AI文本检测器的指导下改写AI生成内容，生成专门优化以绕过检测的对抗样本。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在多种检测系统中显著降低了检测率（如RADAR和Fast-DetectGPT上的T@1%F分别减少64.49%和98.96%），且文本质量仅有轻微下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了面对日益复杂的规避技术，需要开发更鲁棒和弹性的检测策略。

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型（LMMs）主要针对英语，缺乏对多语言和文化多样性的研究，尤其是在视频领域。

Method: 提出ViMUL-Bench基准测试，包含8k手动验证样本，覆盖15个类别和14种语言；同时开发了多语言视频LMM（ViMUL）和1.2百万样本的训练集。

Result: ViMUL在多语言视频理解中表现出更好的高低资源语言平衡性。

Conclusion: ViMUL-Bench、ViMUL模型及训练数据将公开，以推动文化和语言包容性多语言视频LMM的研究。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language

experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动提取历史事件的方法，结合多种LLM（GPT-4、Claude、Llama 3.2）和三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG），并通过Coq验证实现高阶推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建历史事件的计算表示成本高，且现有RDF/OWL推理器仅支持一阶逻辑片段，无法进行更深层次的时空和语义分析。

Method: 使用多种LLM和三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG）自动提取历史事件，并通过Coq验证其语义结构。

Result: 增强策略在不同性能维度上优化：基础生成在覆盖范围上表现最佳，RAG在精度上更优；模型架构影响增强效果。Coq验证了RAG提取的事件类型的语义合法性。

Conclusion: 自动提取方法结合LLM和增强策略有效解决了历史事件表示问题，并通过Coq实现了高阶推理验证。

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Method: 提出综合数据整理方法，构建多模态医学数据集，并通过多阶段训练和强化学习增强模型能力。

Result: Lingshu在多项医学任务中表现优于现有开源多模态模型。

Conclusion: Lingshu通过改进数据与训练策略，显著提升了医学MLLM的性能，为医学AI应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为Com$^2$的基准测试，专注于复杂常识推理，填补了现有研究的空白，并展示了LLMs在此类任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在简单常识推理中表现优异，但在复杂和隐式常识推理中表现不佳，而后者对人类更为重要。现有研究多集中于数学和代码等复杂任务，复杂常识推理因不确定性和缺乏结构而未被充分探索。

Method: 论文结合因果事件图作为结构化复杂常识，采用因果理论（如干预）修改因果事件图以生成不同场景，并利用LLM通过慢思考合成示例。此外，还通过侦探故事构建更具挑战性的子集。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在推理深度和广度上存在困难，但后训练和慢思考可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: Com$^2$基准测试填补了复杂常识推理的研究空白，为LLMs在此类任务中的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式分解和动态整合多模态信息，显著提升了情感计算的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量大型推理模型（LRMs）推理效率的新方法，通过引入推理效率前沿（efficiency frontiers）和推理效率差距（REG）指标，并开发了REO-RL算法以减少REG，从而在保持准确性的同时提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）虽然在复杂问题上表现出色，但其冗长的推理过程导致高推理成本和实际部署困难。现有方法在评估效率提升时缺乏一致性，因此需要一种统一的评估和改进方法。

Method: 论文提出了推理效率前沿作为基准，并定义了REG指标来衡量模型与前沿的差距。通过REO-RL算法（基于强化学习）优化REG，利用稀疏的token预算策略实现高效推理。

Result: 实验表明，REO-RL能显著降低REG（≥50%），并在16K token预算下接近Qwen3-4B/8B的效率前沿，同时保持准确性。消融实验验证了指数token预算策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文表明，尽管REO-RL在提升效率方面取得了进展，但如何完全对齐效率前沿仍是一个开放性问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

TL;DR: 论文提出Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh)框架，通过模拟三种推理模式（溯因、演绎、归纳）的协作，生成结构化推理图，并利用贝叶斯信念传播评估一致性，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言推理任务中表现优异，但其推理过程脆弱且难以解释。现有方法（如Chain-of-Thought）缺乏逻辑结构和内部一致性的评估机制。

Method: ToTh框架通过三个并行代理（分别模拟溯因、演绎和归纳推理）生成推理轨迹，并构建形式化推理图。利用贝叶斯信念传播和自然语言推理（NLI）评估一致性，选择最连贯的图生成最终答案。

Result: 在符号推理（WebOfLies）和数值推理（MultiArith）基准测试中，ToTh表现优于CoT、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding，同时生成可解释且逻辑严密的推理链。

Conclusion: ToTh为构建更鲁棒且受认知启发的LLM推理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Result: CoT对非推理模型有小幅提升但增加变异性；对推理模型增益有限且显著增加成本。

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Motivation: 控制语言模型生成文本的句法结构对于需要清晰性、风格一致性或可解释性的应用至关重要，但目前仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用基于后验推断的采样算法，结合顺序蒙特卡洛和句法标注器，确保生成的每个标记符合目标句法结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要精确控制句法的应用提供了有效解决方案，突显了采样算法的潜力。

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Motivation: 现有方法在几何问题解决中表现不佳或依赖大型模型，计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法结合辅助构造与几何推理。

Method: 提出Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)框架，包括Group Contrastive Masking和长度奖励，训练GeometryZero模型。

Result: GeometryZero在多个几何基准测试中平均提升4.29%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCPO框架和GeometryZero模型为几何推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM可能包含敏感或侵权内容，传统遗忘方法依赖大数据且效果不佳，因此需要一种更高效、可控的遗忘方法。

Method: RULE将遗忘问题转化为拒绝边界优化问题，使用少量遗忘数据和合成边界查询，通过可验证的奖励函数实现安全拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，RULE仅需12%遗忘数据和8%合成数据，遗忘质量和自然性分别提升17.5%和16.3%，且保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: RULE在特定信息遗忘中表现出高效性、自然性提升和强泛化能力，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

Motivation: 随着Video-LLMs在现实应用中的普及，其事实一致性和可靠性至关重要。然而，模型倾向于迎合用户输入而忽视视觉证据（迎合行为），降低了其可信度。目前缺乏针对视频语言领域的系统性评测。

Method: 提出VISE基准，首次专门评测Video-LLMs的迎合行为，涵盖多种问题格式、提示偏见和视觉推理任务。同时引入关键帧选择作为无训练的缓解策略。

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

*Wenxuan Xie,Yaxun Dai,Wenhao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDE-SQL框架通过动态SQL探针使LLM在推理时自主探索数据库，显著提升Text-to-SQL任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态数据库信息，限制了模型对数据的理解能力。

Method: 提出SDE-SQL框架，生成并执行SQL探针，动态检索数据库信息。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，SDE-SQL比基线模型提升8.02%执行准确率。

Conclusion: SDE-SQL在零样本设置下表现优异，且可通过监督微调进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

*Prathamesh Kokate,Mitali Sarnaik,Manavi Khopade,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TF-IDF的句子排序方法，用于长文档分类，显著减少输入大小和推理延迟，同时保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档分类中，BERT等模型因固定输入长度和二次注意力复杂度受限，且通常仅需部分句子信息。

Method: 使用TF-IDF评分结合句子长度，选择固定数量或百分比的最具信息量的句子。

Result: 在MahaNews LDC数据集上，输入大小减少50%以上，推理延迟降低43%，分类准确率仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在不牺牲性能的情况下显著减少上下文的可能性，适用于实际长文档分类任务。

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

Motivation: 探讨非英语语言（尤其是菲律宾语）模型中偏见的来源，并与英语模型进行对比。

Method: 采用信息论偏见归因评分方法，将其适配到菲律宾语模型及多语言模型上进行分析。

Result: 菲律宾语模型的偏见主要由与人、物体和关系相关的词汇驱动，与英语模型的行动相关偏见形成对比。

Conclusion: 英语与非英语模型在处理与社会人口群体相关的输入时存在差异，需针对不同语言设计不同的偏见缓解策略。

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

*Atahan Özer,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理随时间演变的文本数据时的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级框架来解决知识更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于预训练数据，而现实世界信息不断变化，传统更新方法成本高且不灵活。

Method: 引入两个新基准（Temporal Wiki和Unified Clark），并提出一种轻量级框架，通过外部结构化记忆增量更新知识。

Result: 该方法在基准测试中优于ICL和RAG，尤其在处理复杂推理或冲突事实时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了LLMs在动态知识更新中的挑战，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

TL;DR: BiLingua Parser是一种基于LLM的标注工具，用于为代码切换文本生成通用依存关系标注，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换文本在低资源语言环境中缺乏标注数据的问题，以及现有单语解析器在混合语言输入中的泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发了一个基于提示的框架，结合少量样本LLM提示和专家评审，并发布了两个标注数据集。

Result: BiLingua Parser在专家修订后达到95.29%的LAS，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LLM在精心指导下可作为实用工具，为低资源代码切换环境中的语法资源提供支持。

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and
source code are available at https://github.com/N3mika/ParsingProject

Motivation: 理解低资源机器翻译的实际社区需求，补充传统调查方法的不足。

Method: 对Tetun语言机器翻译服务tetun.org的10万条翻译请求进行观察性研究。

Result: 用户多为学生，常从高资源语言翻译到Tetun，涉及科学、医疗等领域，与现有新闻主导的语料库形成对比。

Conclusion: 低资源机器翻译应优先满足教育相关领域需求，观察性研究可为技术开发提供实际指导。

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs
and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys
and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we
propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a
specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in
Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that
challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of
them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource
language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and
daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are
dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results
suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun
should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the
high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates
how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology
development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

Method: 系统评估温度（0-2）对六种能力的数据集的影响，分析不同规模模型（小、中、大）的表现，并提出BERT温度选择器。

Result: 温度对模型性能有技能特异性影响，BERT选择器显著提升小中型模型在SuperGLUE的表现，温度效应在FP16和4位量化模型中一致。

Conclusion: 温度选择复杂但关键，提出的BERT选择器有效优化性能，温度效应随模型规模增大而变化。

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

Method: 在GUM语料库测试集上进行标注实验，提出新的桥接子类型分类系统，并与现有方案对比。

Result: 发现现有资源可能严重标注不足，桥接子类型标注一致性中等，但标注者间对桥接实例的识别一致性较低。

Conclusion: 桥接标注中的主观性显著，需进一步研究以提高标注一致性和资源质量。

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Method: 引入ConfQA微调策略，结合“仅在自信时回答”的提示和知识图谱校准，提出Dual Neural Knowledge框架，动态选择内部神经知识和外部符号知识。

Result: 幻觉率降至5%以下，准确率提升至95%以上，外部检索减少30%以上。

Conclusion: ConfQA和Dual Neural Knowledge框架显著降低了LLM的幻觉率，提高了回答的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Conclusion: 奖励模型的可互换性和作为复杂人类价值观代理的适用性受到挑战，需警惕其潜在偏见在下游模型中的传播。

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

Motivation: 现有角色扮演方法主要依赖提示工程，缺乏稳定性和可解释性，因此需要一种更可控的方法来增强模型的推理能力。

Method: SRPS框架提取角色扮演提示的潜在表示，基于激活模式选择最相关特征，并构建可调节强度的转向向量注入模型的残差流中。

Result: 实验表明，SRPS在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，例如Llama3.1-8B在CSQA上的零样本思维链准确率从31.86%提升至39.80%。

Conclusion: SRPS通过操纵内部特征显著提升模型推理能力，同时提供了更好的可解释性和稳定性，优于传统提示方法。

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Motivation: 当前Finetuning-as-a-Service中，用户数据可能包含有害提示，导致LLM安全性对齐退化。现有方法未从根本上解决有害数据过滤问题。

Method: 利用安全对齐LLM中的拒绝特征区分有害提示，提出ReFT模型作为教师模型，过滤有害数据并蒸馏对齐知识到基础模型。

Result: 实验表明，ReFT策略能有效减少有害输出并提升微调准确性。

Conclusion: ReFT为Finetuning-as-a-Service提供了一种安全可靠的LLM部署方案。

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究依赖BIRD数据集，但该数据集假设用户具备专业知识和领域知识，且人工生成的证据存在缺陷，影响了模型性能。

Method: 提出SEED方法，通过分析数据库模式、描述文件和值来自动生成证据。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider数据集上评估，SEED显著提高了无证据场景下的SQL生成准确性，甚至在某些情况下优于提供BIRD证据的设置。

Conclusion: SEED生成的证据不仅填补了研究与实际部署之间的差距，还提高了文本到SQL模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

Conclusion: PiFi成功结合LLMs和SLMs的优势，为资源受限环境提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为弱到强解码（WSD）的新框架，通过小模型引导大模型生成对齐内容，解决了低资源方法在LLM对齐中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要与人类偏好对齐以避免生成不当内容，但低资源方法在获取高质量对齐内容方面仍面临困难。

Method: 提出WSD框架，利用小型对齐模型生成对齐的开头，再由大型基础模型继续生成后续内容，并通过自动切换机制控制。

Result: 实验表明，WSD框架显著提升了基础模型的对齐能力，优于基线方法，且避免了“对齐税”问题。

Conclusion: WSD是一种有效的低资源对齐方法，能够在不影响下游任务性能的情况下提升模型的对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于指令的统一框架，用于学习适用于信息检索和非检索任务的通用文本嵌入，结合上下文学习、软监督和自适应负采样，无需任务特定微调即可生成上下文感知嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文本嵌入方法在通用性和任务适应性上的不足，通过统一框架优化多种任务性能。

Method: 基于Mistral-7B模型，结合上下文指令、软监督（连续相关性分数）和自适应负采样（基于语义相似度过滤负样本）。

Result: 在MTEB（v2）基准测试中表现优异，覆盖41个任务，排名靠前，优于更大或完全微调的基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合上下文提示、软监督和自适应采样，可高效生成高质量通用嵌入。

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

Motivation: 现有主题模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，需通过领域适应提升性能。

Result: DALTA在低资源数据集上表现优于现有方法，主题一致性和稳定性显著提升。

Conclusion: DALTA为低资源主题建模提供有效解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在知识冲突下的行为，但未能全面评估模型对问题的知识掌握程度。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出KScope框架，通过分层统计测试将LLM知识分为五种状态，并在九个LLM和四个数据集上进行实验。

Result: 发现上下文支持缩小知识差距，特定特征驱动知识更新成功，LLM在不同知识状态下表现相似或差异显著。

Conclusion: 通过特征分析和总结优化上下文，可显著提升知识更新效果，且该方法适用于多种LLM。

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

Result: 发现当前方法在生态效度、不确定性类型及指标优化上存在不足。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区采用更以用户为中心的不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

Motivation: 当前预训练数据集的质量和多样性不足，尤其是推理轨迹的多样性和数据可靠性问题。CCI4.0旨在通过严格的数据处理和多样化CoT模板提升LLM性能。

Method: 提出两阶段去重、多分类器质量评分和领域感知流畅性过滤的数据处理流程，并分阶段提取CoT模板以减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，基于CCI4.0预训练的LLM在数学和代码反射任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 严格的数据处理和多样化推理模板对提升LLM性能至关重要，为自动处理预训练语料提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

Motivation: 多文档摘要中的公平性对提供多样化社会属性值的全面视角至关重要，避免误导决策。现有方法主要关注摘要级公平性，缺乏对语料库级公平性的关注。

Method: 提出FairPO方法，通过扰动文档集生成偏好对以提升摘要级公平性，并通过动态调整偏好对权重提升语料库级公平性。

Result: 实验表明FairPO在保持摘要关键质量的同时优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FairPO在多文档摘要中实现了摘要级和语料库级的公平性，为公平性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一语言模型在结构化任务中约束满足和全局优化不足的问题。

Method: 将输出视为基因，通过语言模型指导选择、交叉和变异等进化操作迭代优化。

Result: 在行程规划、学术大纲和商业报告等任务中表现优异，生成结果结构良好且满足需求。

Conclusion: GA LLM通过结合两种组件的优势，比单一语言模型更好地满足约束并生成高质量解决方案。

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

Conclusion: DEBATE为跨语言和文化的DTS研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%

Conclusion: PSCB和DPO为提升LLM解释的自洽性和可信度提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

Motivation: 字节级回退虽能有效防止OOV，但在处理CJK语言和表情符号等字符多样场景时会显著增加序列长度，导致计算效率下降。

Method: 提出一种简单的无损压缩技术。

Result: 该方法能够无损地减少序列长度。

Conclusion: 该技术为解决字节级回退带来的计算效率问题提供了一种实用方案。

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Conclusion: SELT是一种通用性强、无需外部奖励的框架，有效提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for

baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future

*Peyman Rostami,Vahid Rahimzadeh,Ali Adibi,Azadeh Shakery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对2024年美国总统选举的立场检测数据集PolitiSky24，基于Bluesky平台，涵盖用户级立场分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注推文级立场，而用户级立场数据稀缺，尤其在新兴平台如Bluesky上。用户级立场能更全面地反映观点。

Method: 数据集包含16,044个用户-目标立场对，结合信息检索和大型语言模型生成标签，支持透明性。

Result: 标注方法达到81%的准确率，数据集具有时效性、开放性和用户级视角。

Conclusion: PolitiSky24填补了政治立场分析的空白，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次尝试将大语言模型（LLMs）适配到乌克兰方言（Hutsul），通过构建平行语料库和词典，并利用RAG生成合成数据，最终微调模型在翻译任务中表现优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决乌克兰Hutsul方言这一低资源且形态复杂的方言的机器翻译问题。

Method: 构建平行语料库和词典，提出RAG管道生成合成数据，使用LoRA微调多个开源LLMs，并采用多指标评估策略。

Result: 微调的小模型（7B）在自动和LLM评估指标上均优于零样本基线（如GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和微调，小模型在低资源方言翻译任务中表现优异，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoRMA的新方法，通过矩阵乘法变换替代传统的加法更新，解决了计算复杂性和秩瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP领域表现出色，但全微调计算成本高。现有方法如LoRA采用加法更新，限制了性能。

Method: 提出LoRMA，将加法更新转为矩阵乘法变换，通过操作重排和秩膨胀策略优化计算。

Result: 实验证明LoRMA在多种评估指标下表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRMA为高效微调提供了新思路，优于传统加法更新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 通过细粒度标注教师意图，改进LLM在教育场景中的生成响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育应用中缺乏与教学策略的对齐，需任务特定适应。

Method: 使用11种教学意图的细粒度分类重新标注MathDial数据集，并微调LLM。

Result: 细粒度模型生成的响应更符合教学策略且更有效。

Conclusion: 教学意图的细粒度标注对教育场景中的文本生成有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了DOCCI-Critique基准和VNLI-Critique模型，用于评估和改进大视觉语言模型（VLM）生成段落长度图像描述的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法难以检测VLM生成段落描述中的细粒度错误，缺乏验证数据集和自动化工具。

Method: 构建包含1,400个VLM生成描述的基准数据集（DOCCI-Critique），并开发VNLI-Critique模型进行自动化事实分类和错误分析。

Result: VNLI-Critique在多个基准测试中表现优异，AutoRater与人类评估高度一致，Critic-and-Revise流程显著提升描述准确性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了关键基准和实用工具，显著提升了VLM图像理解的细粒度评估标准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

TL;DR: TreeReview是一个新颖的框架，通过分层和双向问答过程生成全面且深入的论文评审，同时显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在辅助同行评审时难以兼顾全面性和效率，因此需要一种更高效且深入的评审方法。

Method: TreeReview通过递归分解高层次问题为细粒度子问题，构建问题树，并通过从叶到根的迭代聚合生成最终评审。动态问题扩展机制用于在需要时生成后续问题。

Result: 实验表明，TreeReview在全面性和深度上优于基线方法，同时减少了80%的LLM令牌使用量。

Conclusion: TreeReview提供了一种高效且深入的论文评审方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在低资源语言（如波兰语）中的安全性漏洞，通过少量字符修改和小型代理模型计算词重要性，展示了低成本但高效的攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多语言任务中表现出色，但安全训练数据主要集中于高资源语言（如英语），导致低资源语言易受攻击。

Method: 通过修改少量字符和使用小型代理模型计算词重要性，构建低成本攻击方法，并在波兰语中验证其有效性。

Result: 攻击显著改变了LLMs的预测，揭示了其内部安全机制的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在低资源语言中的安全性问题，并提供了攻击方法和数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

<details>

Motivation: 构建高质量的日语TTS数据集需要准确的音素和韵律标注，传统方法依赖纯文本或音频，效果有限。

Result: 客观评估显示优于传统方法；主观评估表明合成语音自然度接近人工标注。

Conclusion: 该方法为日语TTS数据集标注提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种实用的领域特定语言模型评估方法，并揭示了适应过程中知识表示的新见解，有助于更高效的微调策略和减轻灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理对LLM具有挑战性，现有方法在生成质量和问题复杂性上存在问题。

Result: 生成了39K问题和6.1K高难度基准测试，模型性能随推理长度增加而下降，微调实验验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法及数据集有望推动LLM推理能力的未来研究。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文审核了Twitch的自动审核工具AutoMod，发现其在标记仇恨内容时存在显著漏洞，同时误判了许多良性内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台依赖自动化系统进行内容审核，但实时互动（如直播评论）对审核系统的延迟和效果提出了更高要求，目前对其有效性知之甚少。

Method: 通过创建测试账户，使用Twitch API发送超过10.7万条评论，评估AutoMod对仇恨内容（如性别歧视、种族主义等）的标记准确性。

Result: AutoMod漏检高达94%的仇恨内容，但对包含侮辱性词汇的内容100%删除；同时误判了89.5%的良性内容。

Conclusion: AutoMod在理解上下文方面存在重大缺陷，需改进以更有效地识别仇恨内容和避免误判。

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Motivation: 当前LLM在生成RAG答案时存在过度总结或无法准确识别相关基础信息的问题，需要一个细粒度的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含2366个多样化问题的基准，标注超过35K段落，涵盖私人和网络数据，以反映真实场景。

Result: 评估显示，LLM倾向于过度总结而非严格基于相关段落生成答案（最高相关事实性得分60%），且在无相关信息时难以正确回避（最高31%正确率）。

Conclusion: GaRAGe为评估LLM在RAG任务中的表现提供了理想测试平台，揭示了模型在时间敏感问题和稀疏数据源上的性能不足。

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

Conclusion: FAST为指令模型提供高效SAE训练方案，并揭示通过SAE干预特殊令牌激活可改进输出质量。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

TL;DR: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在长链思维（CoT）监督训练中表现下降，称为Long CoT Degradation，主要由于错误累积。实验表明，即使大量数据训练也难以恢复性能，但可通过适当监督微调缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究长链思维监督训练对小型语言模型的影响，发现其性能显著下降的现象。

Method: 在Qwen2.5、LLaMA3和Gemma3等小型模型上进行实验，分析长CoT训练对性能的影响。

Result: 小型模型在长CoT训练中性能下降高达75%，且难以恢复；错误累积是主要原因。

Conclusion: 长CoT训练对小型模型效果有限，需结合监督微调以优化性能。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了瑞士议会语料库的长篇版本，通过结合Whisper Large-v3和GPT-4o的修正流程，显著提升了语音-文本对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为低资源、领域特定的语音语料库提供高质量的长篇语音-文本对齐数据。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-v3转录音频，再通过两步骤GPT-4o修正（命名实体修正和语义完整性评估），最后基于预测BLEU分数和GPT-4o评分过滤低质量数据。

Result: 最终语料库包含801小时音频，其中751小时通过质量控制，相比原始版本BLEU分数提升6点。

Conclusion: 结合ASR、LLM修正和数据驱动过滤，可显著提升低资源领域语音语料库的质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习促进抽象推理的方法（AbstraL），以应对大语言模型在分布变化时的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模大语言模型在分布变化（如数值或名义变量变化）时推理能力下降的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习（而非监督微调）来训练模型进行抽象推理，生成抽象数据以连接符号工具。

Result: AbstraL方法在GSM扰动基准测试中显著减少了性能下降。

Conclusion: 抽象推理通过强化学习能更有效地提升语言模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

### [397] [LLM Unlearning Should Be Form-Independent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07795)
*Xiaotian Ye,Mengqi Zhang,Shu Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM（大语言模型）遗忘技术中的形式依赖偏差问题，并提出了一种新的无训练方法ROCR来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法在实际场景中效果有限，主要因为其依赖于训练样本的形式，难以泛化到不同表达形式的知识。

Method: 论文提出了ROCR（Rank-one Concept Redirection）方法，通过重定向模型参数来实现无训练遗忘，针对下游任务中的不变性进行操作。

Result: 实验表明，ROCR显著提升了遗忘效果，并生成更自然的输出。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘应具备形式无关性，ROCR为解决这一问题提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习中伪标签选择和加权的问题，提升模型在数据不平衡情况下的鲁棒性。

Method: 结合协同训练和一致性正则化，设计三重重伪标签加权模块，整合多种现有技术。

Result: 在5个NLP数据集上9/10设置中达到SOTA，数据不平衡情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: MultiMatch是一种高效且鲁棒的半监督学习算法，特别适用于数据不平衡任务。

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Result: 评估了29个主流MLLMs，揭示了模型在开发过程中的技能特点和弱点。

Conclusion: WebUIBench为MLLMs在Web开发中的能力提升提供了系统化评估工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaF的两阶段框架，通过干预推理来解决大语言模型在长上下文推理和生成中注意力分散的问题，显著提升了推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理和生成中容易受到干扰模式的影响，导致注意力分散，从而降低推理准确性和生成质量。

Method: LeaF框架分为两阶段：首先通过梯度比较识别干扰标记，然后在蒸馏阶段修剪这些标记以对齐注意力分布。

Result: 实验表明，LeaF在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提升性能，并有效抑制了对干扰标记的关注。

Conclusion: LeaF通过干预推理解决了注意力分散问题，生成了更可靠和可解释的推理模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

TL;DR: MEMOIR是一种新颖的可扩展框架，通过残差记忆模块注入知识，同时保留预训练模型的核心能力，解决了语言模型高效可靠更新的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在部署后需要更新知识时的高效性和可靠性问题，避免重训练或遗忘先前信息。

Method: 通过残差记忆模块和稀疏输入激活掩码，将每个编辑限制在记忆参数的不同子集，减少编辑间的干扰。推理时通过稀疏激活模式匹配相关编辑。

Result: 在问答、幻觉纠正和分布外泛化等任务上，MEMOIR在LLaMA-3和Mistral上表现出色，支持数千次顺序编辑且遗忘最少。

Conclusion: MEMOIR在可靠性、泛化性和局部性指标上达到最先进水平，为语言模型的持续更新提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: MiniCPM4展示了高效性和广泛适用性，成功应用于多种场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

Motivation: 量子机器学习在复杂结构化数据建模中具有潜力，QGT旨在通过量子自注意力机制提升效率和表达能力。

Method: QGT将参数化量子电路（PQCs）融入图消息传递框架，实现量子自注意力机制，减少可训练参数。

Result: QGT在五个情感分类基准测试中表现优于或与现有量子模型相当，相比经典图变换器平均准确率提升5.42%（真实数据）和4.76%（合成数据），且样本效率提高50%。

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基量子自然语言处理技术在高效和可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布的扰动分析框架，用于测试大语言模型（LLM）输出在干预下的变化，解决了现有方法无法处理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效比较LLM输出的变化，尤其是由于系统的随机性或计算复杂性。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛采样在低维语义相似空间中构建经验分布，进行频率假设检验。

Result: 框架具有模型无关性、支持任意输入扰动、提供可解释的p值等特点，并通过案例验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM审计提供了一个可靠的频率假设检验方法。

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现代语言模型通过确定性分词器（如字节对编码）将字符字符串的概率分布表示为更短的标记字符串分布。然而，当前方法存在非规范标记编码问题，导致模型分配了不必要的概率质量。本文提出两种方法（条件化和构造化）强制规范标记字符串，提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在标记化过程中会为大量非规范标记编码分配概率质量，这不仅错误（因为这些编码从未出现在训练数据中），还浪费了概率资源。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）通过条件化（无需额外训练）在推理时强制规范标记；2）通过构造化（需重新训练）在模型参数中保证规范输出。

Result: 实验表明，修正规范性问题可以提高多个模型和语料库的保留数据似然。

Conclusion: 通过强制规范标记字符串，可以避免概率质量的错误分配，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs的多样性是否真正减少了模型的同质性，以及这种同质性对实际任务的影响。

Method: 对超过350个LLMs进行大规模实证评估，使用两个流行的排行榜和一个简历筛选任务。

Result: 模型错误之间存在显著相关性，尤其是在更大、更准确的模型中，即使架构和提供商不同。

Conclusion: LLMs的同质性可能导致下游任务中的问题，如算法单一化，需要进一步研究以解决这一现象。

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

Result: RPT显著提高了语言模型在下一个词预测任务中的准确性，并为后续强化学习微调提供了强大的预训练基础。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效且有前景的预训练范式，能够推动语言模型预训练的进一步发展。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预训练模型在金融应用中表现不佳，主要原因是预训练阶段缺乏金融数据以及跨领域时间序列模式的负迁移效应。

Method: 提出了Delphyne模型，通过针对金融时间序列数据的预训练，解决了数据连续、噪声多、频率和延迟差异大的挑战。

Result: Delphyne在公开数据集上仅需少量微调步骤即可与现有基础模型和全样本模型竞争，并在多种金融任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Delphyne为金融时间序列分析提供了有效的预训练解决方案，显著提升了性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

Conclusion: 结合Transformer和XAI的方法在股票价格预测中表现出色，有望提升个人参与金融市场的能力。

Abstract: Financial literacy is increasingly dependent on the ability to interpret
complex financial data and utilize advanced forecasting tools. In this context,
this study proposes a novel approach that combines transformer-based time
series models with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enhance the
interpretability and accuracy of stock price predictions. The analysis focuses
on the daily stock prices of the five highest-volume banks listed in the
BIST100 index, along with XBANK and XU100 indices, covering the period from
January 2015 to March 2025. Models including DLinear, LTSNet, Vanilla
Transformer, and Time Series Transformer are employed, with input features
enriched by technical indicators. SHAP and LIME techniques are used to provide
transparency into the influence of individual features on model outputs. The
results demonstrate the strong predictive capabilities of transformer models
and highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to empower
individuals in making informed investment decisions and actively engaging in
financial markets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化媒体对大型股票的关注度，并探索其与市场表现的关系，为金融分析和预测提供新工具。

Method: 利用NLP技术构建基于新闻数量和市值调整的Hype Index，并通过分类、市场表现关联、信号能力和实证特性等多维度评估。

Result: Hype Index系列工具在股票波动分析、市场信号和金融NLP扩展中表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: Hype Index为金融领域提供了一种新的量化工具，尤其在股票波动和市场信号分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power
for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including
correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index
family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market
signaling, and NLP extensions in Finance.

TL;DR: 论文提出FinAR-Bench，一个专注于财务报表分析的基准数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在金融分析任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要评估LLMs回答金融问题的能力，但未反映其在生成财务分析报告等实际任务中的表现，存在不准确风险。

Method: 将财务分析任务分解为三个可测量步骤：提取关键信息、计算财务指标和应用逻辑推理，以结构化方式评估LLMs。

Result: 研究明确了LLMs在财务分析中的优势和局限性，并提供了更实用的性能评估方法。

Conclusion: FinAR-Bench为LLMs在金融领域的实际应用提供了更可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to
transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense
of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the
automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for
making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding
corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a
single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead
to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing
financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions
but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial
analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark
dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of
fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we
break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information,
calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This
structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each
step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current
strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical
way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文开发并验证了一个名为LLM-D12的12项问卷，用于测量人们对大型语言模型（LLM）的依赖程度，分为工具性依赖和关系性依赖两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM依赖的工具稀缺且基于行为成瘾症状，但LLM与人类的关系更为复杂，需要新的视角。

Method: 基于作者的理论工作开发问卷，收集526名英国参与者的数据，通过探索性和验证性因子分析验证量表结构。

Result: 量表支持两因素结构（工具性依赖和关系性依赖），具有良好内部一致性和区分效度。

Conclusion: LLM依赖不一定表示功能障碍，但在某些情境下可能成为问题，LLM-D12为研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large
language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even
addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals
may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Conclusion: 结论强调未来LLM开发和平台设计需平衡用户赋权与风险控制，以应对LLM辅助的虚假信息挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of
LLM-assisted disinformation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术更面向人类，呼吁采用参与式方法开发AI，但现有研究多关注主要利益相关者（如终端用户），而忽略了次要利益相关者。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈，研究次要利益相关者如何实现参与式AI的三个理想（知情、同意和能动性），并提出了三种利益相关者原型。

Result: 研究发现次要利益相关者在实现参与理想时需要克服系统性障碍，并提出了三种原型：不情愿的数据贡献者、无支持的活动家和善意的实践者。

Conclusion: 本文展望了一个次要利益相关者能够有意义地参与AI系统的未来，强调了知情、同意和能动性的重要性。

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个结构化概念框架，用于理解AI对齐问题，区分了对齐目标、范围和利益相关者，为跨领域整合提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在非受控环境中的应用增加，确保其安全性和符合规范成为紧迫挑战，但现有领域（如AI安全、AI对齐和机器伦理）的界限模糊，缺乏明确指导。

Method: 开发了一个结构化概念框架，通过分类对齐目标（安全性、伦理性等）、范围（结果与执行）和利益相关者（个体与集体）来明确AI对齐问题。

Result: 框架揭示了多种合理的对齐配置，为跨领域实践和哲学整合提供了基础，并明确了“全面对齐”的含义。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI对齐研究提供了清晰的结构化指导，有助于解决跨领域整合的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial
agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly
controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that
they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent
interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI
Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the
conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,
leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework
for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,
we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,
legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual
vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment
configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical
integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to
be aligned all-things-considered.

Conclusion: 需多管齐下，结合技术、监管和国际合作，抵御AI恶意群体的威胁。

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;
and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.

Conclusion: 研究为开发可靠的个性化电路分析辅导工具提供了基准和见解，并展示了方法在更广泛工程教育课程中的适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various
fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to
their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates
how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark
the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama
3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis
course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference
solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit
analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current
state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX
format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics
of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and
units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly
better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B
each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally,
we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of
circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in
LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results
establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a
reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future
work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a
broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各领域广泛应用，但其与国际人道法的合规性尚未充分研究，需评估其拒绝违法请求的能力及解释的清晰度。

Method: 研究测试了八种主流LLMs，评估其对明确违反IHL的提示的拒绝能力及解释的清晰度，并引入标准化安全提示进行干预。

Result: 多数模型能拒绝违法请求，但解释质量不一；标准化提示显著提升解释质量，但复杂请求仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更安全、透明的AI系统提供了参考，并提出了评估LLMs与IHL合规性的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

Motivation: 提高对突发性灾害（如地震）的主动准备能力，需要高效的模拟方法。

Method: 使用多模态数据集（地理空间、社会经济、建筑和街景图像数据），结合LLMs生成MMI预测，并通过RAG和ICL技术优化性能。

Result: 在2014年纳帕和2019年里奇克莱斯特地震中，预测与实际报告的DYFI数据高度相关（0.88），RMSE低至0.77。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟灾害影响方面具有潜力，有助于加强灾前规划。

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

TL;DR: 论文提出用大型语言模型（LLMs）替代专家政治调查，以研究突发事件后的关联因素，并以2025年联邦裁员为例验证其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突发事件（如2025年联邦裁员）后，专家判断受结果影响，难以重建事件前的感知，传统测量方法失效。

Method: 使用LLMs进行成对比较提示，生成联邦机构的意识形态分数，并与裁员目标关联分析。

Result: LLMs复现了裁员前的专家测量结果，并预测了裁员目标，同时发现某些机构的“知识机构”属性也是预测因素。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为专家调查的替代方案，尤其在传统方法失效时，论文还提出了使用LLMs的两部分标准。

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Motivation: 现有LLM在模拟社会行为时缺乏认知基础，无法可靠地分析人类的推理、决策或对干预的反应。

Method: 提出GenMinds框架，结合认知科学支持生成智能体的结构化信念表示；设计RECAP评估框架，通过因果可追溯性、人口统计基础和干预一致性评估推理保真度。

Result: GenMinds框架和RECAP评估方法为生成智能体提供了更可靠的认知基础，使其能够模拟思维而不仅仅是语言。

Conclusion: 论文推动了从表面模仿到基于认知的生成智能体的转变，为社会科学模拟提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more
than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning
that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly
used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting
and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal
reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how
people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds
(GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief
representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the
RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess
reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and
intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from
surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just

voice cloning, face-swapping, and synthetic media creation have advanced
significantly, lowering both financial and technical barriers for their use.
While these technologies present innovative opportunities, their rapid growth
raises concerns about trust, privacy, and security. This white paper explores
the implications of deepfake technology, analyzing its role in enabling fraud,
misinformation, and the erosion of authenticity in multimedia. Using
cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we
explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources,
demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By
analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and
detection, we emphasize the urgent need for regulatory frameworks, public
awareness, and collaborative efforts to maintain trust in digital media.

*Yifan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: QuantMCP框架通过标准化工具调用，将LLMs与实时金融数据API连接，解决数据幻觉问题，提升金融分析的准确性和深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在金融分析中潜力巨大，但受限于数据幻觉和缺乏实时数据访问。

Method: 利用Model Context Protocol (MCP)标准化工具调用，连接Python金融数据API，支持自然语言交互。

Result: QuantMCP实现了LLMs与实时金融数据的准确对接，解锁了其分析能力，支持更明智的金融决策。

Conclusion: QuantMCP为LLMs在金融领域的应用提供了可靠、可扩展的桥梁，提升了分析的深度和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing
financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often
hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time,
verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel
framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By
leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool
invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array
of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can
interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data,
thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More
critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's
analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated
data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed
financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible,
and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial
data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM
applications in finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能注释的类别多且分布不平衡，传统蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）难以应对。受RLHF在LLM对齐中的成功启发，作者希望通过类似方法改进蛋白质功能预测。

Method: 提出AnnoDPO，一种多模态框架，利用DPO进行偏好对齐训练，整合生物知识。

Result: AnnoDPO为蛋白质表示学习中的生物知识整合提供了新范式。

Conclusion: AnnoDPO通过偏好对齐训练解决了注释稀缺和类别不平衡问题，提升了蛋白质功能预测能力。

Abstract: Deciphering protein function remains a fundamental challenge in protein
representation learning. The task presents significant difficulties for protein
language models (PLMs) due to the sheer volume of functional annotation
categories and the highly imbalanced distribution of annotated instances across
biological ontologies. Inspired by the remarkable success of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) in large language model (LLM) alignment, we
propose AnnoDPO, a novel multi-modal framework for protein function prediction
that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance annotation
learning. Our methodology addresses the dual challenges of annotation scarcity
and category imbalance through preference-aligned training objectives,
establishing a new paradigm for biological knowledge integration in protein
representation learning.

### [427] [GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for Query Expansion in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04762)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤幻觉内容和组合文档，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算强度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询扩展中表现优异，但成本高且计算资源需求大，限制了其可访问性。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除生成文档中的非事实和不一致内容）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与过滤内容）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer在使用小型语言模型时优于其他方法，并与大型LLMs方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GOLFer为查询扩展提供了一种高效且经济的替代方案，尤其适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: DISRetrieval是一个基于语言学话语结构的层次检索框架，通过利用修辞结构理论（RST）和自适应摘要技术，显著提升了长文档理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能捕捉文档的固有话语结构，限制了长文档理解的效果。DISRetrieval旨在通过语言学结构提升检索性能。

Method: 1. 使用RST构建句子级层次表示；2. 结合LLM增强节点表示；3. 设计层次证据检索机制。

Result: 在QASPER和QuALITY数据集上，DISRetrieval在检索指标和问答任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 语言学结构对长文本理解至关重要，DISRetrieval为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合强化学习和LLM的RL-LLM-AB测试框架，用于自动化和个性化A/B测试，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销中，如何有效算法化A/B测试以最大化用户响应是一个亟待解决的问题。

Method: 基于预训练的语言模型，通过Prompt-Conditioned Generator生成候选内容变体，结合用户画像和上下文动态选择内容版本，并通过Actor-Critic结构优化策略。

Result: 数值结果表明，RL-LLM-ABTest在真实营销数据上优于传统A/B测试、Contextual Bandits和基准强化学习方法。

Conclusion: RL-LLM-ABTest框架通过结合强化学习和LLM，有效提升了A/B测试的个性化和自动化水平，适用于长期用户偏好建模。

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinBERT2是一个专门针对金融领域的双向编码器，通过预训练在高质量金融语料上，解决了LLMs在金融应用中的三大限制，并在分类、检索和主题建模任务中显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在金融领域的实际应用中存在性能不足、依赖检索增强生成以及特征场景不完善等问题，FinBERT2旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FinBERT2是一个预训练在32b金融语料上的双向编码器，通过微调实现分类（Fin-Labelers）、检索（Fin-Retrievers）和主题建模（Fin-TopicModel）任务。

Result: FinBERT2在金融分类任务中平均优于其他模型9.7%-12.3%，在检索任务中优于开源和专有模型，并实现了更好的主题聚类效果。

Conclusion: FinBERT2为金融领域的NLP任务提供了高效解决方案，并在LLMs时代展示了BERT模型的实用价值。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG在高资源语言中已有研究，但阿拉伯语的RAG组件优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用RAGAS框架，系统评估了分块策略、嵌入模型、重排序器和语言模型在阿拉伯语数据集上的表现。

Result: 句子感知分块效果最好；BGE-M3和Multilingual-E5-large是最佳嵌入模型；重排序器显著提升复杂数据集的忠实度；Aya-8B生成质量更高。

Conclusion: 研究为构建高质量的阿拉伯语RAG管道提供了关键见解，并为不同文档类型的组件选择提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育平台普及，但现有练习推荐方法无法适应学生多样化的学习节奏和低活跃度学生的学习模式，导致推荐准确性和多样性有限。

Method: NR4DER结合mLSTM模型优化练习筛选模块，采用序列增强方法提升低活跃学生的表示，并通过神经重排序生成多样化推荐列表。

Result: 实验表明，NR4DER在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，并能有效适应学生多样化的学习节奏。

Conclusion: NR4DER通过改进推荐系统，显著提升了练习推荐的准确性和多样性，适应了学生的个性化学习需求。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing
number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving
student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,
it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on
individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results
indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple
real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of
students.

Conclusion: Transformer方法在复杂航空数据分析中优势显著，未来将探索混合模型和多语言数据集。

Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety
reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based
embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic
modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of
0.41 compared to PLSA 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability
as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the
advantages of modern transformer based approaches in analyzing complex aviation
datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in
aviation safety. Future work will explore hybrid models, multilingual datasets,
and advanced clustering techniques to further improve topic modelling in this

Result: 在ML-100K和Amazon Beauty数据集上，LlamaRec-LKG-RAG在MRR、NDCG和Recall等指标上显著优于LlamaRec。

Conclusion: 证明了结构化推理在LLM推荐中的重要性，为下一代知识感知的推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

Motivation: 传统旅游搜索引擎需要用户从目的地开始并编辑搜索参数，限制了搜索的灵活性和自然性。

Method: 模型采用三项创新：领域特定的多任务优化、不对称密集检索架构和广泛的图像处理。

Result: 在四个测试集上，HotelMatch-LLM显著优于现有模型（如VISTA和MARVEL），在主要查询类型上达到0.681的分数。

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its

Motivation: 传统方法如MLoRA缺乏处理多样化用户行为的灵活性，需要一种更灵活的框架来适应不同领域的用户交互。

Method: 提出MoE-MLoRA框架，先独立训练专家以专攻其领域，再训练门控网络动态加权专家贡献。

Result: 在Movielens和Taobao数据集上测试，MoE-MLoRA在动态数据集中表现优异（如Taobao-20中加权AUC提升1.45），但在结构化数据集中效果有限。

Conclusion: 专家架构在多领域推荐系统中潜力巨大，任务感知的专业化和自适应门控能提升复杂环境中的预测准确性。

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种辅助一致性损失方法，用于解决Stable Diffusion微调中的欠拟合和过拟合问题，提升生成图像的身份一致性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法存在欠拟合（无法可靠捕捉主题身份）和过拟合（记忆主题图像并减少背景多样性）的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出两种一致性损失：先验一致性正则化损失（保持非主题图像的扩散噪声一致性）和主题一致性正则化损失（增强模型对噪声调制潜码的鲁棒性）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP分数、背景多样性和视觉质量上优于DreamBooth，同时保持主题身份。

Conclusion: 通过引入一致性损失，有效平衡了主题身份保持与图像多样性，提升了微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视频中忠实重建纹理形状和物理属性是一个有趣但具有挑战性的问题，现有方法依赖复杂优化流程，效率低且泛化性差。

Method: Vid2Sim首先通过前馈神经网络从视频中重建物理系统配置，再通过轻量级优化流程细化估计的外观、几何和物理属性。

Result: 实验表明，Vid2Sim在从视频数据重建几何和物理属性方面具有更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: Vid2Sim提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，显著提升了从视频中重建和模拟物理系统的能力。

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在训练视角不足时，对未见过或被遮挡部分的渲染质量较低。环境中的重复元素为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出一种方法，对3DGS重建中的重复实例进行分割、配准，并在实例间共享信息，同时考虑外观变化。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中验证了方法，显著提升了新视角合成的质量。

Conclusion: 通过利用重复元素，有效改善了因覆盖不足和遮挡导致的低质量部分的重建。

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: 该设计为资源受限设备上的实时3DGS渲染提供了高效解决方案，并计划开源以推动领域发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局运动，而生成真实多样的HOI需要更细粒度的人体部分与物体部分的交互理解。

Method: 提出PAGs表示，从LLMs提取细粒度部分信息，并通过三阶段合成：分解3D物体、生成参考视频提取运动约束、优化4D运动序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能灵活生成复杂交互序列，显著提升真实性和文本对齐。

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE在零样本4D HOI生成中表现出色，尤其在多对象或多人物交互场景中。

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: PIG方法在3D高斯场景中实现了高精度的对象交互与渲染，具有显著的视觉质量提升和应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

Result: 在几何精度和渲染质量上显著优于现有方法，实时性高（单GPU 0.015秒/推理）。

Conclusion: 为分辨率无关的3D场景增强建立了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Conclusion: SpeeDe3DGS模块化设计，可集成到任何可变形3DGS框架中，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

Motivation: 现有的3D数据压缩方法通常需要大量真实数据集训练，而Squeeze3D旨在通过合成数据实现高效压缩，同时支持多种3D格式。

Method: 通过可训练的映射网络连接预训练编码器和生成模型的潜在空间，将3D数据编码为紧凑的潜在代码，再通过生成模型解压缩。

Result: Squeeze3D实现了高达2187倍的纹理网格压缩比、55倍的点云压缩比和619倍的辐射场压缩比，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: Squeeze3D提供了一种高效、灵活的3D数据压缩方法，无需真实数据集训练，且支持多种3D格式。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知能增强机器人操作的灵活性，但由于其局部性，难以单独用于需要全局场景理解的任务。主动感知技术可以弥补这一不足，但目前缺乏标准化基准。

Method: 提出了Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite，包含多样化的模拟场景和数据集（合成3D MNIST数字模型和真实触觉样本），并训练CycleGAN用于逼真的触觉模拟渲染。

Result: 提供了标准化的协议和可复现的评估框架，促进了触觉感知和主动感知领域的系统性进展。

Conclusion: 该基准套件为触觉感知和主动感知研究提供了标准化工具，有助于推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative
assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,
safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)
to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously
evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and
security-critical systems.

Conclusion: 边缘计算可有效提升协作感知能力，适用于延迟敏感的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

Motivation: 离线训练的视觉语言导航策略在陌生环境中性能下降，熵最小化可能因错误积累导致过度自信。

Method: 提出混合熵优化和自我主动学习策略，结合动作和伪专家分布优化不确定性校准。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，ATENA显著优于基线方法，克服了测试时的分布偏移。

Conclusion: ATENA通过主动学习和不确定性校准，提升了导航策略的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Result: 在MetaWorld任务和真实机器人任务中，SAIL持续提升性能，且对数据过滤和初始演示质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAIL通过自我改进和互联网规模数据适应，为机器人任务提供了一种高效视频模型迭代方法。

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

Conclusion: DriveSuprim通过创新方法解决了选择式方法的局限性，实现了高性能和安全性。

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Result: 在X-DAPT数据集上，RoboPARA显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务组合中表现突出。

Conclusion: RoboPARA为双臂任务并行规划提供了高效可靠的解决方案，并发布了首个相关数据集。

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

*Yash Turkar,Youngjin Kim,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NightHawk框架通过结合主动照明和曝光控制，优化地下环境中的图像质量，提升视觉估计的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下环境（如涵洞）光线昏暗且缺乏特征，机器人视觉面临挑战，现有照明方法存在反射、过曝和功耗问题。

Method: 提出NightHawk框架，利用贝叶斯优化动态调整光照强度和曝光时间，并设计基于特征检测的指标作为优化目标。

Result: 实验显示，特征检测和匹配性能提升47-197%，显著改善了恶劣光照条件下的视觉估计。

Conclusion: NightHawk有效解决了地下环境中的视觉挑战，为机器人导航提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态空间语言地图（VLMaps和AVLMaps），将预训练多模态特征与3D环境重建融合，支持自然语言命令导航和多模态目标查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在环境映射、空间精度和多模态信息利用方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过自主探索构建视觉-语言地图（VLMaps）和音频-视觉-语言地图（AVLMaps），结合预训练多模态特征和3D重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法支持零样本空间和多模态目标导航，在模糊场景中召回率提升50%。

Conclusion: 多模态空间语言地图为机器人导航和交互提供了更灵活和高效的支持。

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

TL;DR: GTRS是一个端到端多模态规划的统一框架，结合粗粒度和细粒度轨迹评估，解决了静态和动态轨迹评分方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹评分方法在泛化性上存在不足，静态词汇表难以适应细粒度调整，动态提案无法捕捉更广泛的轨迹分布。

Method: GTRS包含三个创新：扩散基轨迹生成器、词汇表泛化技术和传感器增强策略。

Result: GTRS在Navsim v2挑战赛中表现优异，接近依赖真实感知的特权方法。

Conclusion: GTRS通过结合粗粒度和细粒度评估，提升了轨迹评分的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

Conclusion: RoboCerebra推动了更具能力和泛化性的机器人规划器的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Conclusion: SpikePingpong为高速动态任务中的机器人控制提供了新视角，实现了复杂战术策略的稳健执行。

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

Motivation: 强化学习从零学习新任务效率低，如何有效利用和适配先验知识是关键挑战。

Method: CARoL通过分析状态转移识别任务相似性，动态适配先验知识，适用于多种RL算法。

Result: 在仿真和实际实验中，CARoL表现出更快收敛和更高奖励，成功将仿真策略迁移到现实任务。

Conclusion: CARoL为机器人学习新任务提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

Method: 设计谓词提示编码几何信息，查询LLM生成任务计划，结合MCTS在混合动作空间中搜索可行参数，避免直接依赖LLM输出。

Result: 在六个G-TAMP问题上，该方法优于之前的LLM规划器和纯搜索算法。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的常识与MCTS的搜索能力，可高效解决G-TAMP问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Conclusion: MapBERT通过对象感知掩码和比特编码，显著提升了室内语义分布的建模能力。

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

Conclusion: HAPO方法确保了VLA模型的可靠部署和从失败中有效学习。

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The
experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior
generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation
tasks.

Method: 提出实时分块（RTC）算法，适用于任何基于扩散或流的VLA模型，无需重新训练。算法在执行当前动作块时生成下一个动作块，通过“冻结”已执行动作和“修复”未执行部分实现平滑异步执行。

Conclusion: RTC算法有效解决了AI系统在高频控制任务中的延迟问题，为实时交互提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

leveraged for multi-robot 3D scene graph fusion. This representation supports
real-time, view-invariant relocalization (via the object-based map) and
planning (via the 3D scene graph), allowing a team of robots to reason about
their surroundings and execute complex tasks. Additionally, we introduce a
planning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain
Definition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by
leveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities. We
provide an experimental assessment of the performance of our system on

Conclusion: BridgeVLA在3D操作学习中高效且有效，具有强大的泛化能力和样本效率。

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,
highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project

### [467] [CellCLIP -- Learning Perturbation Effects in Cell Painting via Text-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06290)
*Mingyu Lu,Ethan Weinberger,Chanwoo Kim,Su-In Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CellCLIP是一个跨模态对比学习框架，用于高内涵筛选数据，通过预训练图像编码器和新型通道编码方案，显著提升了性能并减少了计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高内涵筛选数据（如Cell Painting）的语义与自然图像差异大，且不同扰动类型难以在同一潜在空间表示，因此需要开发新方法。

Method: CellCLIP结合预训练图像编码器、新型通道编码方案和自然语言编码器，学习统一的潜在空间。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和生物学任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为高内涵筛选数据提供了一种高效且性能优越的跨模态学习解决方案。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

*Xiaoke Wang,Batuhan Altundas,Zhaoxin Li,Aaron Zhao,Matthew Gombolay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的方法，结合行为克隆和强化学习训练图神经网络，为混合整数线性规划（MILP）求解器提供高质量初始解，显著减少计算时间和方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合整数线性规划（MILP）在规划与调度问题中应用广泛，但计算时间长限制了其在大规模实时场景中的使用。

Method: 利用行为克隆（BC）和强化学习（RL）训练图神经网络（GNN），为多智能体任务分配与调度问题中的MILP求解器提供初始解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持解的质量和可行性的同时，显著减少了优化时间和方差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了MILP求解器的效率，适用于大规模实时场景。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are essential tools for solving
planning and scheduling problems across critical industries such as
construction, manufacturing, and logistics. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by long computational times, especially in large-scale, real-time
scenarios. To address this, we present a learning-based framework that
leverages Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), producing high-quality initial solutions for
warm-starting MILP solvers in Multi-Agent Task Allocation and Scheduling
Problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces optimization
time and variance compared to traditional techniques while maintaining solution
quality and feasibility.

### [469] [Mutual-Taught for Co-adapting Policy and Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06292)
*Tianyuan Shi,Canbin Huang,Fanqi Wan,Longguang Zhong,Ziyi Yang,Weizhou Shen,Xiaojun Quan,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Mutual-Taught方法，通过自训练迭代优化策略模型（PM）和奖励模型（RM），无需额外人工标注，解决了分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型（LLM）的偏好优化中，新生成的模型样本与奖励模型（RM）训练数据之间的分布偏移会降低RM效果，进而影响策略模型（PM）性能。

Method: 采用类似EM算法的自训练方法：E步用当前RM反馈更新PM；M步用PM更新前后的输出构建训练数据更新RM。

Result: 实验表明，迭代方法持续提升模型性能，8B策略模型LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT在AlpacaEval-2上胜率为54.1%，8B奖励模型FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT在RewardBench上与GPT-4o-2024-08-06表现相当。

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught方法有效解决了分布偏移问题，显著提升了PM和RM的性能。

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合持久同源性和传统借贷网络的异质图神经网络（HTGNN），用于银行信用评级预测，解决了数据隐私导致的完整银行间连接图缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行信用评级对经济稳定和利益相关者决策至关重要，但隐私问题导致完整的银行间连接图难以获取，限制了图神经网络的应用。

Method: 利用持久同源性构建银行关系网络，结合传统借贷网络形成异质网络，并开发HTGNN模型进行评级预测。

Result: 在全球真实数据集上的实验验证了HTGNN的有效性。

Conclusion: HTGNN为投资者和监管机构提供了改进风险管理和市场干预的工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate
and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions,
and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and
regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation
of effective market interventions.The code can be find at

*Yunqing Liu,Wenqi Fan,Xiaoyong Wei,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLProtein是一个创新的蛋白质预训练框架，结合全局结构相似性和局部氨基酸细节，提升预测准确性和功能理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管蛋白质序列分析已取得进展，但整合蛋白质结构信息仍有潜力。结构信息不仅限于3D信息，还包括从氨基酸分子（局部信息）到蛋白质-蛋白质结构相似性（全局信息）的内容。

Method: GLProtein结合了蛋白质掩码建模与三重结构相似性评分、蛋白质3D距离编码和基于子结构的氨基酸分子编码。

Result: 实验表明，GLProtein在多个生物信息学任务中优于先前方法，如预测蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用和接触预测。

Conclusion: GLProtein通过整合全局和局部结构信息，显著提升了蛋白质功能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

### [472] [dLLM-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with Adaptive Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06295)
*Zhiyuan Liu,Yicun Yang,Yaojie Zhang,Junjie Chen,Chang Zou,Qingyuan Wei,Shaobo Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: dLLM-Cache是一种无需训练的缓存框架，通过结合长间隔提示缓存和部分响应更新，显著降低了扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理延迟，速度提升高达9.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）在文本生成中表现出潜力，但其高推理延迟限制了应用。传统加速技术不适用于dLLMs的双向注意力机制，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出dLLM-Cache框架，利用静态提示和部分动态响应的特点，通过长间隔提示缓存和基于特征相似性的部分响应更新，高效重用中间计算结果。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B等模型上的实验表明，dLLM-Cache实现了高达9.1倍的推理速度提升，且不影响输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache显著降低了dLLMs的推理延迟，使其接近自回归模型的性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

*Hanaa El Afia,Said Ohamouddou,Raddouane Chiheb,Abdellatif El Afia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN结合动态图卷积神经网络与Jacobi多项式KAN，用于三维点云分类，性能优于传统DGCNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MLP在点云分类中的局限性，探索多项式基与图学习的交互机制。

Method: 用可调单变量多项式扩展替换MLP层，简化DGCNN架构，避免深层结构。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，Jacobi多项式KAN层在精度和收敛速度上优于传统DGCNN，且参数高效。

Conclusion: 高多项式阶数不一定提升性能，需进一步研究多项式基与图学习的交互。

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

*Bozhi Sun,Seda Tierney,Jeffrey A. Feinstein,Frederick Damen,Alison L. Marsden,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散事件随机模拟和强化学习的动态资源分配策略，以优化医院超声心动图检查的调度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院超声心动图检查调度面临非确定性因素（如患者缺席、到达时间、检查时长等）和资源不对称约束的挑战，需高效解决方案。

Method: 通过预处理数据估计患者缺席概率和检查时长分布，构建SimPy离散事件模拟模型，结合Gymnasium库，比较动态分配与预留策略，并应用强化学习优化。

Result: 动态分配策略表现更优，能更好适应患者变异性与资源约束；强化学习策略进一步提升了效率。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的动态资源分配策略可显著提升超声实验室效率，强化学习方法为优化调度提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

*Daniel Halpern,Evi Micha,Ariel D. Procaccia,Itai Shapira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过多奖励函数分布来反映多样化人类偏好的方法，解决了传统对齐方法忽视少数观点的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好因用户、背景和文化而异，传统对齐方法将分歧简化为多数信号，忽视少数观点。

Method: 通过直接从成对偏好中学习奖励函数分布，无需标注者标识或预定义组，将标注者分歧视为信息性软标签。核心准则是成对校准。

Result: 理论和实证表明，即使是小规模无异常值的集合也能准确表示多样化偏好分布，训练启发式方法有效提高了校准性。

Conclusion: 该方法能更忠实地反映多元化价值观，为对齐问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICRL prompting的新方法，通过在LLM推理过程中引入多轮提示和奖励反馈，使LLM表现出类似强化学习的行为，从而提升任务完成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在推理过程中是否能够表现出类似强化学习的行为，并利用这一现象提升任务性能。

Method: 提出ICRL prompting框架，通过多轮提示和奖励反馈（数值标量）引导LLM逐步优化响应。

Result: 在Game of 24、创意写作和ScienceWorld三个基准测试中，ICRL prompting显著优于基线方法（如Self-Refine和Reflexion）。

Conclusion: ICRL prompting展示了LLM在推理过程中能够最大化奖励信号，为扩展测试时计算提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

Conclusion: Generative AI（GenAI）正在改变能源管理，Agentic Digital Twin概念的提出为下一代自主、主动的能源管理系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端事件虽罕见但破坏性强，数据稀缺导致建模困难，现有方法多关注通用数据而非极端事件的独特需求。

Method: 综述了生成建模技术和大语言模型，结合统计理论和专门训练机制捕捉重尾分布，并提出了评估框架。

Result: 总结了基准数据集和评估指标，分析了各指标在极端事件中的适用性，并指出了未充分探索的应用领域。

Conclusion: 论文为极端事件合成数据研究提供了结构化基础，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究位置编码方法如何影响Transformer模型的性能，填补Transformer理论中的关键空白。

Method: 通过函数逼近定义表达能力，使用Rademacher复杂度建立泛化界限，提出基于正交函数（如小波和Legendre多项式）的新编码方法。

Result: 实验表明，基于正交变换的编码方法在泛化和外推任务上优于传统的正弦编码。

Conclusion: 该研究为自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域的Transformer设计提供了理论支持和新方法。

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准实践中仅依赖最终层嵌入可能丢失有价值信息，探索分子编码器的完整表示深度以提升性能。

Method: 对五种分子编码器进行分层分析，测试22种ADMET属性预测任务，比较固定嵌入和微调中间层的效果。

Result: 中间层嵌入平均提升5.4%，微调后平均提升8.5%，部分任务提升高达40.8%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 探索分子编码器的中间层嵌入可显著提升性能与计算效率，支持“评估后微调”的高效方法。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出SAFFRON，一种针对LLM安全保证的新型推理扩展范式，通过多叉奖励模型（MRM）减少奖励模型评估次数，解决探索效率困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全保证方法易受越狱攻击，且推理扩展在安全领域的潜力未被探索。

Method: 提出SAFFRON范式，包括多叉奖励模型（MRM）、部分监督训练目标、保守探索约束和基于Trie的缓存策略。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，并公开了模型和数据集。

Conclusion: SAFFRON为LLM安全提供了高效解决方案，并推动未来研究。

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的共识方法WISCA，用于整合机器学习模型的解释性结果，以提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和高风险领域中，机器学习模型的解释性至关重要，但现有方法常产生冲突结果，需要共识策略来统一解释。

Method: 研究训练了六个ML模型，使用多种模型无关的解释技术，并提出了WISCA方法，结合类别概率和归一化属性生成共识解释。

Result: WISCA与最可靠的个体方法一致，证明了共识策略在提升解释可靠性中的价值。

Conclusion: WISCA作为一种稳健的共识方法，能够有效整合不同解释性算法的结果，提高解释的可靠性。

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)
models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes
domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield
conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize
results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets
with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability
techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and
a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which
integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

TL;DR: SPARQ提出了一种基于质量-多样性算法的方法，通过单一模型生成高质量且多样化的数学问题-解决方案对，显著提升了模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成多样化且复杂的问题对时存在局限性，SPARQ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用质量-多样性算法，通过测量问题解决率（难度代理）生成问题对，并基于难度和多样性筛选数据。

Result: 从7.5K种子数据生成2000万问题对，模型性能提升24%；质量（难度）和多样性分别提升分布内和分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARQ展示了合成数据生成对模型性能的显著提升，并揭示了数据质量与多样性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多无人机系统的控制和优化在动态和受限环境中仍具挑战性，特别是在集成地面和非地面网络（如高空平台站HAPS）的场景下。

Method: 采用分层协作的LLM框架，HAPS上的LLM负责无人机接入控制，而每架无人机上的LLM处理运动规划和控制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在系统奖励、运营成本和无人机碰撞率方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的知识驱动范式为下一代3D空中高速公路系统的开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过动态模型选择和分层推理策略降低语言模型的推理成本，使其更适合资源受限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的推理计算成本高且耗能大，限制了其在移动、边缘或成本敏感环境中的部署。

Method: 提出了两种策略：(i) 路由选择最适合查询的模型，(ii) 分层推理逐步升级模型直到获得可靠响应。

Result: 这些策略通过轻量级模型处理简单任务，仅在必要时使用大模型，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括更快响应时间、基于任务复杂度的自适应模型选择，以及跨异构环境的可扩展部署。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为E2H Reasoner的方法，通过从易到难的任务调度（E2H）提升语言模型的推理能力，避免直接使用强化学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，仅用强化学习（RL）提升语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用从易到难的任务调度（E2H），逐步构建推理能力，并通过理论分析证明其收敛性和样本效率。

Result: 实验表明，E2H Reasoner显著提升了小型语言模型（1.5B至3B）的推理能力，优于单独使用强化学习。

Conclusion: E2H Reasoner是一种有效的方法，通过任务调度和理论支持，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: MarginSel是一种通过选择困难示例来优化大语言模型（LLMs）上下文学习（ICL）性能的方法，显著提升了分类任务的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果对示例的选择和排序敏感，因此需要一种自适应的方法来优化演示示例的选择。

Method: 提出MarginSel，一种两步法，为每个测试实例选择困难的演示示例。

Result: 在分类任务中，F1分数绝对提升2-7%。

Conclusion: MarginSel通过增加困难示例的边距，类似支持向量，优化了LLMs的决策边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context
learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特征而无法捕捉基本图结构信息，因此需要一种更强大的拓扑描述符。

Method: 提出SpectRe，将谱信息融入持久同调图，并分析其全局和局部稳定性。

Result: SpectRe在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，提升了图模型的学习能力。

Conclusion: SpectRe是一种更强大且稳定的拓扑描述符，适用于图表示学习。

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）在处理TAG时因复杂文本信息表现不佳，现有方法依赖大量标注或微调，成本高。

Method: GAGA通过构建标注图捕捉拓扑关系，并采用两级对齐模块将标注图与TAG结构对齐。

Result: 实验表明，GAGA仅需1%的标注数据即可达到或超越现有方法的分类准确率。

Conclusion: GAGA在高效性和性能上均表现出色，为TAG表示学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Motivation: 传统非侵入式负载监测方法因负载组合和应用环境复杂多变，存在特征鲁棒性差和模型泛化能力不足的问题。

Result: 在高采样率负载数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别精度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过视觉特征和持续学习有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为智能电力管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）在特定风格提示下（如列表格式）可能增加越狱攻击成功率（ASR），风格长度和注意力相关。风格微调会加剧风险，而SafeStyle防御策略能有效提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨风格提示是否影响LLM安全性，以及如何通过防御策略降低风险。

Method: 评估32个LLM在7个越狱基准上的表现，分析风格模式对ASR的影响，并提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格提示显著提高ASR，风格微调加剧风险；SafeStrategy能有效提升安全性。

Conclusion: 风格提示和微调会增加LLM越狱风险，SafeStyle是一种有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

Conclusion: SPT和Sequence Score技术能高效预测蛋白质功能并解释其决策过程，为生物智能研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐是反应式的，攻击者和防御者脱节，导致防御滞后于威胁。

Method: 将安全对齐建模为零和博弈，模型在攻击者和防御者角色间切换，通过奖励模型裁决结果。

Result: Self-RedTeam发现更多样化的攻击（+21.8% SBERT），并在安全基准测试中表现更鲁棒（如WildJailBreak上+65.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究提倡从被动修补转向主动协同进化，通过多智能体强化学习实现语言模型的自主稳健改进。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Motivation: 解决CoM中子链仅依赖前一个子链信息而丢失长距离依赖的问题。

Method: 提出GoCE，将隐式令牌表示映射为可微分稀疏因果邻接矩阵，结合因果掩码注意力和因果-MoE，并通过干预一致性损失测试和自进化门实现动态平衡。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证，GoCE在捕捉长距离因果依赖和自进化能力上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: GoCE不仅超越了CoM的设计原则，还为未来因果学习和持续自适应改进研究提供了经验。

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

### [497] [E-LDA: Toward Interpretable LDA Topic Models with Strong Guarantees in Logarithmic Parallel Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07747)
*Adam Breuer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的非梯度组合方法，用于推断LDA主题模型中每个文档的主题分配，具有对数并行计算时间的高效性，并在语义质量和可解释性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LDA主题模型在实际应用中的主要推断问题，特别是在社会科学、数据探索和因果推断等领域。

Method: 采用非梯度组合方法估计主题模型，确保对数并行计算时间和可解释性保证。

Result: 算法在语义质量和可解释性上优于现有LDA、神经主题模型和基于LLM的主题模型，且适用于下游因果推断。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和性能上显著优于现有技术，为LDA主题模型的实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

*Michael K. Chen,Xikun Zhang,Jiaxing Huang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAFT的新方法，通过多标记训练改进大型语言模型的概念理解能力，显著优于传统单标记预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型通过单标记预测学习，导致概念理解碎片化，无法形成连贯的高层次语义，限制了其智能水平。

Method: 引入Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT)，一种多标记训练方法，使模型能够学习跨多个标记的序列，增强概念感知能力。

Result: 实验表明，CAFT在文本摘要和蛋白质设计等任务中显著优于传统方法，并在后训练阶段首次实现了多标记预测。

Conclusion: CAFT不仅提升了模型性能，还为机器学习社区提供了更广泛的应用潜力，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

### [499] [Feature-Based Instance Neighbor Discovery: Advanced Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06782)
*Qinting Jiang,Chuyang Ye,Dongyan Wei,Bingli Wang,Yuan Xue,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIND的新方法，通过特征实例邻居发现解决深度神经网络在测试时分布偏移下的性能下降问题，显著提升了动态场景中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试域之间的分布偏移下性能下降，影响应用体验。现有测试时适应方法难以应对动态多测试分布。

Method: FIND方法包括三个关键组件：层间特征解耦（LFD）、特征感知批量归一化（FABN）和选择性FABN（S-FABN），分别用于稳定捕获相似分布特征、优化特征表示和提升推理效率。

Result: 实验表明，FIND在动态场景中显著优于现有方法，准确性提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过特征实例邻居发现有效解决了分布偏移问题，为测试时适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

### [500] [Is Optimal Transport Necessary for Inverse Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06793)
*Zixuan Dong,Yumi Omori,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种简单的替代方法（最小距离奖励和分段匹配奖励），挑战了逆强化学习中必须使用最优传输的观点，实验表明这些方法性能与最优传输方法相当甚至更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最优传输方法在逆强化学习中虽有效，但存在算法复杂、超参数敏感等问题，作者质疑其必要性。

Method: 提出两种启发式方法：最小距离奖励（不考虑时间顺序）和分段匹配奖励（轻量级时间对齐）。

Result: 在32个基准测试中，简单方法与最优传输方法性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: 最优传输的核心优势可能来自基本对齐而非复杂耦合，未来设计应重新评估复杂性。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在序列建模任务中，最小非线性通常足够且最优，简化模型并提高鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨非线性在循环网络中的功能角色，确定其计算必要性和机制。

Method: 使用几乎线性循环神经网络（AL-RNNs）作为建模工具和内部机制探针。

Result: 发现最小非线性不仅足够，而且通常最优，模型更简单、鲁棒和可解释。

Conclusion: 为选择性引入非线性提供了原则性框架，连接动力学系统理论与循环神经网络的功能需求。

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

Motivation: 现有异构图自监督学习模型通常通过元路径将异构图转换为同构图进行训练，仅利用元路径两端节点的信息，而忽略了元路径上的异构节点信息。

Method: 提出了IMPA-HGAE框架，通过创新的掩码策略和元路径引导的结构语义，充分利用元路径上的内部节点信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，IMPA-HGAE在异构数据集上表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂图场景下的鲁棒表示学习提供了新思路，并讨论了生成式自监督学习在异构图中的未来方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出HeuriGym框架，用于评估LLM在组合优化问题中生成启发式算法的能力，揭示了当前模型在工具使用、规划和自适应推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分衡量LLM在复杂问题解决中的能力，需要更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 引入HeuriGym框架，通过代码执行反馈和迭代优化评估LLM生成的启发式算法，并提出QYI指标量化性能。

Result: 测试9个先进模型，发现其QYI得分仅为0.6，远低于专家基准1。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLM在科学和工程领域的实际应用提供了更有效的评估基准。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

Result: 实验验证了POET在训练大语言模型中的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: POET为大规模神经网络训练提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of
artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models
remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this
challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that
uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in
training LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有INR方法在处理复杂科学场时因局部高频变化而表现不佳的问题，同时避免因引入刚性几何结构导致的灵活性下降和模型膨胀。

Method: 采用交叉注意力机制和记忆库学习灵活特征表示，结合坐标引导的专家混合（MoE）提升模型效率和特征专业化。

Result: 在三个大规模集成模拟数据集上，FA-INR实现了最优保真度，同时显著减小模型规模。

Conclusion: FA-INR在INR替代模型中建立了精度与紧凑性的新平衡，为复杂科学场建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式表示（如对象描述符或3D分割图）存在离散、易缺失和噪声问题，阻碍了新类发现的准确性。

Method: NeurNCD采用Embedding-NeRF模型和KL散度，结合特征查询、调制和聚类等技术，实现语义嵌入和视觉嵌入空间的信息交换。

Result: 在NYUv2和Replica数据集上，NeurNCD显著优于现有方法，无需密集标注数据或人工干预。

Conclusion: NeurNCD为开放世界新类发现提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模任务中，SAFE生成的稀疏网络泛化性能优于基线方法，且对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAFE是一种有效的剪枝方法，适用于现实场景，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分布外检测任务中优于现有方法，能够有效捕捉时空不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过控制协方差核平滑度，显著提升了图数据中不确定性估计的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with
limited monitoring data. Fine-grained air quality monitoring information is
essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we
propose a physics-guided graph neural network architecture called GraPhy with

data. Experiments using data from California's socioeconomically disadvantaged
San Joaquin Valley show that GraPhy achieves the overall best performance
evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square
value (R2), improving the performance by 9%-56% compared to various baseline

Motivation: 现有方法假设所有查询成本相同，而实际中某些查询可能成本更高（如触发额外审查或惩罚），因此需要开发更高效的算法来处理这种不对称成本场景。

Method: 提出了不对称搜索（AS）和不对称梯度估计（AGREST），通过减少对高成本查询的依赖并调整采样分布，优化总攻击成本。

Result: 在多种成本设置下，新方法的总查询成本和扰动大小均优于现有方法，某些情况下提升达40%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架能有效应对不对称查询成本问题，并可轻松集成到现有黑盒攻击方法中。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

TL;DR: UdonCare利用医学本体（如ICD-9-CM）发现潜在域，通过层次化框架提升临床预测的领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床预测中数据分布变化导致模型性能下降，且缺乏患者域标签和医学知识整合。

Method: 使用层次化医学本体分组疾病，迭代修剪精细域，并通过Siamese推理机制分离域相关信号。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 医学知识在提升临床领域泛化能力方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症亚型分类对个性化治疗和预后评估至关重要，但多组学数据的异质性导致有效整合具有挑战性。

Method: 采用跨注意力和可学习的模态权重，设计MoXGATE框架，增强多组学特征融合，并应用焦点损失解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在GIAC和BRCA数据集上达到95%的分类准确率，优于现有方法，并验证了跨注意力和不同模态的重要性。

Conclusion: MoXGATE在多组学癌症亚型分类中表现出色，具有高性能和生物通用性。

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在性能上有显著提升，但其大尺寸导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用基于GAN的对抗训练框架，每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和一个分类器，通过对抗训练使中间层特征接近最终层特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持性能的同时，推理速度提升超过1.51倍，并增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FREE方法有效解决了VLM推理延迟问题，同时减少了性能损失，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

Motivation: 解决国际水域非法活动（如非法捕鱼和石油走私）中的GPS欺骗问题，同时应对AI生成虚假轨迹和数据稀疏的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种物理信息扩散模型，结合运动学约束，识别违反物理规律的轨迹。

Result: 在真实数据集（海事和城市领域）上验证，模型在异常检测和轨迹生成方面表现出更高的预测精度和更低的误差率。

Conclusion: 该模型通过整合物理知识，显著提升了异常轨迹检测的准确性，为打击非法活动提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过后处理或推理阶段满足约束，且依赖于分布假设，限制了模型的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用可微分概率投影层（DPPL），结合神经网络架构，实现端到端学习，并优化严格评分规则。

Result: 在偏微分方程学习和时间序列预测中展示了广泛适用性，支持非线性约束和鲁棒分布估计。

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E是一个通用且灵活的方法，能够连接不同领域并提升预测性能。

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有激活引导方法在安全性和实用性之间的权衡问题，缺乏理论支持。

Method: 提出AlphaSteer方法，通过两个学习目标（实用性保持和安全性增强）优化激活引导向量。

Result: 实验表明AlphaSteer显著提升LLM安全性且不影响通用能力。

Conclusion: AlphaSteer是一种有效且理论支持的方法，解决了安全性与实用性的权衡问题。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Result: PGTS在复杂环境中表现更优，能避开局部陷阱，获得更优解。

Conclusion: PGTS通过树搜索提升策略梯度方法的全局优化能力，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，显著提升了MLLMs的多模态感知与推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

Conclusion: CoFILL通过创新的扩散模型和双流架构，解决了时空数据填补中的关键问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法存在嵌入分布缺乏明确调控和过度依赖大批量负样本的问题，导致语义相关实例可能被错误分离且泛化能力受限。

Method: VarCon将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类别变量的变分推断，最大化后验加权的证据下界（ELBO），实现高效的类感知匹配和细粒度控制。

Result: 在多个数据集上，VarCon达到了最先进的性能（如ImageNet-1K上79.36%的Top-1准确率），并展现出更清晰的决策边界和语义组织。

Conclusion: VarCon在性能、泛化能力和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，为对比学习提供了更高效的框架。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Conclusion: 结合语言模型先验和学习字符串嵌入空间，可为通用BBO算法的发展开辟新途径。

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

Result: 实验表明，QDRT生成的攻击在多样性和有效性上均优于现有方法，适用于多种目标LLM。

Conclusion: QDRT为自动化红队测试提供了系统且有效的解决方案，有助于推动LLM的安全部署。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI)的新算法，解决了在函数逼近下强化学习算法（如策略迭代）单调性保证失效的问题。RPI通过约束优化替代传统方法，保证了单调性和收敛性，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在函数逼近下单调性保证失效，导致性能不稳定。RPI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RPI采用基于Bellman的约束优化替代传统策略评估中的投影或Bellman误差最小化。

Conclusion: RPI是首个在函数逼近下具有单调性和收敛性保证的算法，且易于集成到现有模型无关方法中。

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like

both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view
probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture

approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for

on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's
robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态扩散模型提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，突破了现有方法的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Conclusion: AMoPO能够实现维度感知的偏好对齐，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生成模型在新领域的局限性，强调需要更谨慎的评估方法。

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Result: 在四个大规模真实交通数据集上，RAGL在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGL模型通过正则化和高效图卷积，显著提升了交通预测的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，‘超频’方法能够减少过度思考，提高答案准确性，并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 通过调节推理长度和进度编码，可以显著优化LLM的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential

scaling trends influenced by HMM properties, and offer theoretical conjectures

scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world
animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models
designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an

Result: 在NVIDIA L4 GPU上测试显示，推理延迟仅线性增长（约2倍），而峰值内存使用几乎不变。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来长上下文模型部署提供了高效解决方案，并已开源实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to

Conclusion: JavelinGuard为LLM安全应用提供了高效的模型选择，平衡了复杂性和效率。

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each

Motivation: 在封闭环境中，传统适应方法因无法访问模型参数或架构而不可行，SALT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在客户端引入紧凑可训练的适配器，优化头部网络的潜在特征，实现用户特定适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证，SALT在降低训练延迟的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: SALT为边缘AI系统提供了一种实用的个性化推理解决方案，适用于严格系统约束下的场景。

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly
important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring
systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning
mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on
Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring
framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature
extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of
LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management
ability of cloud infrastructure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分数阶雅可比矩阵的矩阵微分方法（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），并将其应用于深度学习中的自动微分技术，验证了其在多层感知机中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数阶微分具有不同于整数阶微分的特性，可用于优化神经网络算法，但目前缺乏与自动微分技术兼容的分数阶矩阵微分方法。

Method: 通过整数阶雅可比矩阵定义引入分数阶雅可比矩阵微分（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），并基于此设计了分数阶自动微分技术，应用于深度学习隐藏层。

Result: 实验表明，${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$在训练集和验证集上的Loss分析、测试集指标定量分析以及时间和GPU内存消耗方面均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$是一种优秀的分数阶梯度下降方法，适用于深度学习领域。

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

Conclusion: 该流水线是资源受限环境中实时部署VLM的可行解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used
in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the
computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Nan Sun,Xixun Lin,Zhiheng Zhou,Yanmin Shang,Zhenlin Cheng,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于证据深度学习的动态图OOD检测方法EviSEC，通过不确定性估计和谱感知对比学习解决现有方法的偏差和分数同质化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的OOD检测在安全敏感领域备受关注，但现有方法主要针对静态图，存在单点估计导致的偏差和方差问题，以及缺乏OOD训练数据导致的分数同质化问题。

Method: 提出EviSEC方法，结合证据神经网络（输出后验Dirichlet分布）和谱感知增强模块，通过不确定性估计和生成OOD近似样本解决上述问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EviSEC能有效检测动态图中的OOD样本。

Conclusion: EviSEC通过结合不确定性估计和谱感知对比学习，显著提升了动态图OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，以主动管理和解决LLM部署中的不确定性，而非被动拒绝高不确定性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署中，可靠性保障方法仅限于拒绝高不确定性输出，缺乏系统区分和应对不同不确定性来源的工具。

Method: 采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，为不确定性提供一致的理论基础，并明确其可减少性。

Result: 该框架支持主动解决不确定性（如请求澄清、检索外部信息或优化输入），而非被动避免。

Conclusion: 通过主动解决不确定性，该框架有望实现更可靠、透明且广泛适用的LLM系统，尤其在高风险现实场景中。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

TL;DR: LeanHammer是第一个针对Lean证明助手的端到端通用工具，结合了神经前提选择和符号推理，显著提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络在自动推理中取得进展，但将其融入实际验证工作流仍具挑战性。Lean缺乏高效的工具（hammer），阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 开发了LeanHammer，采用动态适应上下文的新型神经前提选择系统，并与符号证明搜索和重构结合。

Result: 评估显示，LeanHammer比现有前提选择器多解决21%的目标，且能泛化到不同领域。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了神经检索与符号推理间的鸿沟，提升了形式验证的实用性。

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DGN的方法，利用先验数据指导探索而非直接模仿，显著提升了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在强化学习中高效利用先验数据（如演示），避免模仿学习目标对长期性能的负面影响。

Method: 通过数据引导的噪声（DGN）框架，将先验数据用于指导探索，而非强制行为克隆。

Result: 在七个模拟连续控制任务中，DGN方法比现有离线数据强化学习方法提升了2-3倍的性能。

Conclusion: DGN方法通过优化探索策略而非直接模仿，有效提升了样本效率和长期性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过仅使用概率最高的top-p状态来加速动态概率模型推理的方法，同时证明了误差受p和模型最小混合率的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态概率模型推理涉及高计算成本，尤其是隐马尔可夫模型中需要枚举整个状态空间，导致效率低下和噪声增加。

Method: 仅使用累积概率为p的最可能状态（top-p状态）来去噪和加速推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可实现至少一个数量级的加速，且总变差距离误差低于0.09。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著提升推理速度的同时，误差可控，适用于动态概率模型的高效推理。

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在无线网络中面临设备数据异构性和带宽限制问题，现有研究多关注单个设备的梯度发散，而本文证明设备级和样本级的集体梯度发散共同影响收敛速度。

Method: 提出FedCGD算法，将设备级CGD转化为加权地球移动距离（WEMD），并考虑采样方差，通过多项式时间优化平衡两者。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，分类准确性提升4.2%，同时调度设备减少41.8%，并能灵活调整WEMD和采样方差的优化目标。

Conclusion: FedCGD算法有效解决了多级CGD问题，显著提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT方法在减少参数的同时保持性能，但设计空间大且配置不当会导致结果不佳，传统搜索方法开销大。

Result: PrunePEFT显著降低了计算负担，提升了PEFT方法的可扩展性和效率。

Conclusion: PrunePEFT为大规模预训练模型的高效微调提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线分层强化学习方法依赖高层策略生成子目标序列，但随着任务时间延长效率下降，且缺乏跨轨迹有效状态转移的策略。

Method: GAS通过将状态嵌入到TDR空间，聚类语义相似状态为图节点，利用最短路径算法选择子目标序列，并引入TE指标优化图质量。

Result: GAS在运动、导航和操作任务中表现优于现有方法，关键任务中得分88.3，远超之前的1.0。

Conclusion: GAS通过图搜索和状态聚类显著提升了离线分层强化学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: 该集成方法为安全关键领域的深度学习模型提供了可信赖和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to
decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on
complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance
and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and
long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7%
improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup
over diffusion counterparts in inference time.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Conclusion: RR-GNN通过创新方法解决了GNN的不确定性量化问题，为高风险领域提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，通过信息论视角分析公平性泛化误差，并基于Efron-Stein不等式推导出紧致的公平性泛化界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对公平性在训练数据与未见数据之间泛化的理论保证，公平性过拟合问题未得到充分研究。

Method: 基于Efron-Stein不等式，利用互信息（MI）和条件互信息（CMI）推导公平性泛化界限。

Result: 实证结果验证了界限的紧致性和实际相关性，适用于多种公平感知学习算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计提升公平性泛化的算法提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级序列Transformer模型，用于1型糖尿病患者的血糖预测，解决了穿戴设备计算和内存限制的问题，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1型糖尿病需要持续监测血糖，但现有预测模型在穿戴设备上部署困难，计算和内存限制是主要挑战。

Method: 结合Transformer的注意力机制和循环神经网络的序列处理能力，设计轻量级模型，并采用平衡损失函数处理数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在OhioT1DM和DiaTrend数据集上，模型在血糖预测和不良事件检测方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了高性能模型与实际部署之间的空白，为1型糖尿病管理提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的测试时间交互扩展方法（TTI），通过增加代理的交互范围，实现探索、回溯和动态重新规划等行为，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间扩展方法依赖于生成长推理轨迹，无法让代理从环境中获取新信息或随时间调整行为。

Method: 提出TTI方法，基于课程学习的在线强化学习，动态调整代理的交互范围。

Result: TTI在WebVoyager和WebArena基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并能自适应平衡探索与利用。

Conclusion: 交互扩展是计算扩展的强大补充维度，为训练自适应代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解为什么大型语言模型无法同时满足真实性、语义信息守恒、相关知识揭示和知识约束最优性。

Method: 通过将LLM推理建模为“思想拍卖”，并利用Green-Laffont定理证明了这种不可能性。

Result: 结果表明，没有推理机制能同时满足四个基本属性，为模型架构和评估提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 结论是必须接受幻觉的存在，并在模型设计中权衡不同属性。

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference

Result: 在多个生物医学数据示例中展示了框架的灵活性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的统计框架为LSTM模型选择提供了系统且高效的方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly
determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and
thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions
of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions
used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in
order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical
expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is
carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the
learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new
images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including
such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training
simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of
images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent
increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决微电网间能源交易的局部决策问题，实现个体和社区层面的能源平衡。

Method: 采用Hawk或Dove策略的自治代理模型，结合进化算法（重组和变异操作）优化能源交易矩阵。

Result: 在100个微电网的模拟场景中，95个达到稳定能源状态，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 模型在个体和社区层面均能有效实现能源平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

Motivation: 探索生物合理学习规则是否能同时满足任务表现和神经记录对齐的需求，填补后者研究的不足。

Method: 采用Procrustes分析等方法，评估e-prop和BPTT在神经数据相似性上的表现。

Result: e-prop在任务精度匹配时与BPTT神经数据相似性相当，模型架构和初始条件对相似性影响显著。

Conclusion: 生物合理学习规则在任务表现和神经相似性上取得显著进展，潜力巨大。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically
plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

Motivation: 现有语言模型和扩散方法在生成音乐时难以平衡全局一致性和局部保真度，导致音乐性不足或歌词与旋律不匹配。

Method: SongBloom采用自回归扩散模型，结合扩散模型的高保真度和语言模型的可扩展性，逐步从短到长生成音乐草图，并从粗到细细化细节。

Result: 实验表明，SongBloom在主观和客观指标上均优于现有方法，性能接近最先进的商业音乐生成平台。

Conclusion: SongBloom通过交替生成范式有效整合语义和声学上下文，为全长度歌曲生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal
elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language
models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence
with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from
incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces
$\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that
leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and
diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model
that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of
language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short
to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved
generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context
to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that
SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective
metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial
music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page:

Motivation: 现有LALMs在标准基准测试中表现良好，但存在幻觉问题，即模型可能生成与音频内容不符的回答。

Method: AAD是一种轻量级推理策略，通过对比解码比较音频上下文存在与否时的token预测概率，优先选择音频存在时概率增加的token。

Result: 实验表明，AAD在对象幻觉数据集上将F1分数提升了0.046至0.428，在通用音频QA数据集（如Clotho-AQA）上准确率提升了5.4%至10.3%。

Conclusion: AAD有效缓解了LALMs的幻觉问题，并通过消融实验验证了其各组件的有效性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

Method: 提出SD-CTC，扩展CTC以联合分配标记和说话人标签，并将其集成到SOT框架中，仅使用重叠语音和转录学习说话人区分。

Result: 实验表明，SD-CTC与SOT的多任务学习将SOT模型的错误率降低26%，性能接近依赖辅助信息的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SD-CTC为多说话人语音识别提供了一种无需辅助信息的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

Result: 该方法旨在克服传统SBR和盲DNN方法的不足，提升带宽扩展的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合DNN技术和参数化方法，论文为音频带宽扩展提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high
frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth
limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons,
including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral
band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth
extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction
techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio
signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth
extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually
referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information
extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band
signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace
conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies
results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My
proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth
extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth
extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

TL;DR: TERAIO是一个基于SSD的GPU内存扩展框架，通过分析张量生命周期优化卸载/预取策略，显著提升大语言模型训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到LLM训练中活跃张量仅占GPU内存的1.7%，非活跃张量占用大量内存且长期不用，为卸载/预取提供了机会。

Method: 通过前几次迭代分析张量生命周期，生成优化卸载/预取计划，并与PyTorch集成，利用GPUDirect存储直接迁移张量。

Result: 相比ZeRO-Offload和ZeRO-Infinity，TERAIO平均提升训练性能1.47倍，达到理想性能的80.7%。

Conclusion: TERAIO通过高效利用SSD扩展GPU内存，显著优化LLM训练性能。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large
inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is
germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse
scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization
process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this
approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the
scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is
trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution
regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with
nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through
minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss.
Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward
construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning
from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the
optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data,
quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We
highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's
generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the
logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case,
the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new
method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training
without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is
synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The
results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only
accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality
in complex environments.

### [576] [HyColor: An Efficient Heuristic Algorithm for Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07373)
*Enqiang Zhu,Yu Zhang,Haopeng Sun,Ziqi Wei,Witold Pedrycz,Chanjuan Liu,Jin Xu*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HyColor的高效混合启发式算法，用于解决图着色问题（GCP），特别擅长处理大规模稀疏图，同时在小规模密集图上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图着色问题（GCP）是一个经典的组合优化问题，具有NP难特性。现有的算法主要针对小规模硬图或大规模稀疏图，缺乏一种能同时高效处理两者的方法。

Method: HyColor结合了三种策略：局部决策策略以提高色数下界、图简化策略以减少工作图规模，以及基于k核和混合度的贪心启发式算法。

Result: 在209个实例的测试中，HyColor在194个实例（超过93%）中表现最佳，其中34个实例显著优于其他算法，并在128个实例中确定了色数和最优着色。

Conclusion: HyColor在解决大规模稀疏图和小规模密集图的GCP问题上表现出色，显著提升了现有启发式算法的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization
problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of
a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been
extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics,
computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP
algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with
up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic
algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse
graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency
of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to
improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to
reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic
for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three
state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three
large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,
totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently
outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor
achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these
solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore,
HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal
coloring in 128 instances.

Motivation: 研究AI系统在设计和执行复杂数据科学管道方面的能力，填补现有模型在真实世界应用中的不足。

Method: 使用KRAMABENCH基准测试，包含104个管道和1700个数据文件，评估5个通用模型和3个代码生成模型。

Result: 现有模型在明确任务上表现良好，但在需要广泛数据处理和领域知识的复杂管道中表现不足。

Conclusion: KRAMABENCH为开发自主数据科学代理提供了关键步骤，现有模型仍需改进以应对真实世界挑战。

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data
extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources,
and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and
implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical
expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable
reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear
to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and
execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark
composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning
1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these
pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,
requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,
statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a
high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation
models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to
decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and
synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on
KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving
well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data
processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data
science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on
KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science
agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are

TL;DR: MoE-Gyro是一种自监督框架，用于同时解决MEMS陀螺仪的信号饱和重建和噪声抑制问题，显著扩展测量范围并降低噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MEMS陀螺仪在测量范围和噪声性能之间存在固有矛盾，现有方法难以兼顾且部署复杂。

Method: MoE-Gyro采用两个专家模块（ORE和DE）和一个轻量级门控模块，分别处理信号饱和和噪声抑制。

Result: MoE-Gyro将测量范围从450 deg/s扩展到1500 deg/s，降低Bias Instability 98.4%，性能领先。

Conclusion: MoE-Gyro有效解决了MEMS陀螺仪的核心矛盾，并通过ISEBench提供了标准化评估平台。

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate
strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power.
In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of
previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient
and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and
discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种优化的卷积神经网络方法，用于高效预测全球范围内的次声传输损失（TLs），解决了现有方法在不利风条件下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模次声传输损失对评估国际监测系统网络的性能至关重要，但现有方法计算成本高且在某些条件下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了一种优化的卷积神经网络，利用全球模拟的温度和风场数据预测TLs，改进了网络架构以减少预测误差。

Result: 优化后的模型在整个频段（0.1-3.2 Hz）内平均误差为8.6 dB，能够处理现实大气场景。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了TLs预测的效率和准确性，适用于全球范围内的次声监测应用。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

for EEG representation learning, (2) EEG-to-language decoding, (3) cross-modal
generation including image and 3D object synthesis, and (4) clinical
applications and dataset management tools. The survey highlights how
transformer-based architectures adapted through fine-tuning, few-shot, and
zero-shot learning have enabled EEG-based models to perform complex tasks such
as natural language generation, semantic interpretation, and diagnostic
assistance. By offering a structured overview of modeling strategies, system
designs, and application areas, this work serves as a foundational resource for

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive
sources.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

Result: LightGBM表现最优（准确率99%，F1分数0.94），优于CNN（F1分数0.85）。SVM和AdaBoost效果较差。

Conclusion: 手工特征能更好捕捉ECG信号的时空变化，未来可研究多导联信号和连续心跳的时序依赖。

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

Motivation: FPGA部署强化学习资源消耗大，QForce-RL通过量化和轻量化架构解决这一问题。

Result: 性能提升2.3倍，FPS提高2.6倍，适用于资源受限设备。

Conclusion: QForce-RL在资源效率和性能上优于现有技术，具有灵活部署潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x
and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MAGNet是一种混合深度学习模型，结合改进的U-Net和图神经网络（GNN），用于集成电路设计中的DRC违规预测，显著提升了预测精度和降低了误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计规则检查（DRC）对降低成本和提升设计效率至关重要，机器学习方法成为重要研究方向。

Method: MAGNet结合改进的U-Net（含动态注意力模块和多尺度卷积模块）和GNN，通过像素对齐图结构建模拓扑关系，并采用标签放大策略增强稀疏违规模式的敏感性。

Result: MAGNet在DRC热点检测中显著优于ibUnet、RouteNet和J-Net，整体性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: MAGNet通过结合空间、语义和结构信息，实现了更准确的DRC违规预测，并通过增量训练进一步提升了热点识别能力。

Abstract: Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and
design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs.
Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided
design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model
that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation
prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module
(DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability
in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we
construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply
a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During
graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features
with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted
during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation
patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and
structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced
false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through
incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for
hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet,
and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial
improvements in overall performance.

TL;DR: VeriLoC是一种新方法，直接从Verilog代码预测设计和模块级别的质量，利用LLM生成嵌入并训练分类器/回归器，显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代芯片设计复杂，需要从Verilog代码早期预测关键设计质量指标（如时序和布线拥塞），尤其是逐行预测。现有方法未能实现行级预测。

Method: VeriLoC利用Verilog代码生成LLM提取行级和模块级嵌入，训练下游分类器/回归器。

Result: VeriLoC在行级拥塞和时序预测上F1分数达0.86-0.95，平均百分比误差从14%-18%降至4%。

Conclusion: VeriLoC的嵌入和方法对其他硬件设计预测和优化任务也有价值。

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage
prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion
directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware
design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of
code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works
have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph
representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict
module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We
propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from
Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages
recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and
module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on
concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of
0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean
average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We
believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of
value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自然智能（NI）如何在有限资源下高效学习，并提出了通过模拟NI的约束条件来改进AI的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自然智能（NI）的高效性，以改进当前依赖大量资源和数据的AI系统。

Method: 分析了NI的约束如何促进高效编码、混沌游走、储备计算和内在动机驱动的学习。

Result: 约束条件（如有限带宽）可催生高效、适应性强的智能系统。

Conclusion: 建议AI系统采用‘少即是多’原则，如能量约束和简约架构，以实现更高效和可解释的智能。

Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn
language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from
sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI
relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach
high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically
catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how
limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex
patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like
representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust
generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain
transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage
uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections
facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental
perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive
social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.
Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we
suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,
parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the
emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded
artificial systems.

Motivation: 现有水印方法在潜在空间中嵌入，与时间序列生成器的真实空间操作不兼容，因此需要一种直接在真实空间中嵌入水印的方法。

Method: TimeWak通过时间链式哈希水印和ε-精确反转技术，直接在真实时空特征中嵌入水印，并处理非均匀重建误差分布。

Conclusion: TimeWak为多变量时间序列扩散模型提供了一种高效且可检测的水印方法，解决了真实空间水印嵌入的挑战。

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型（LLM）水印在低熵生成任务（如编码）中效果不佳的问题，提升水印检测的准确性和文本生成质量。

Method: 提出优化框架，设计两种可调水印方法（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），通过随机辅助信息最大化检测概率并最小化文本失真。

Result: 实验表明，新水印方法在低熵任务中能实现高检测准确率，且对文本质量影响极小。

Conclusion: 新水印方法在理论和实践中均表现优异，揭示了水印与编码理论的新联系。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的语言模型安全评估方法，针对隐蔽攻击设计，开发了BSD基准测试，用于评估防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估主要关注明显攻击和低风险任务，但实际攻击者可能通过多次看似无害的查询组合完成危险任务，需要新的防御方法。

Method: 开发了BSD数据生成管道，自动化评估隐蔽攻击及其防御措施，并创建了两个新数据集。

Result: 实验表明分解攻击是有效的滥用手段，而状态防御是一种可行的对策。

Conclusion: BSD基准测试和状态防御为应对隐蔽攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and
low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by
requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.
Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to
{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the
attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against
such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data
generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and
corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that
are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker
open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are
effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于API提供商可能为了降低成本或恶意修改模型行为而悄悄提供量化或微调的变体，用户难以检测这些替换行为，因为缺乏对模型权重甚至输出logits的访问。

Method: 提出了一种基于秩的统一性测试方法，该方法准确、查询高效，且避免可检测的查询模式，从而对抗可能重定向或混合响应的对抗性提供商。

Result: 在多种威胁场景（如量化、有害微调、越狱提示和完整模型替换）下评估，该方法在有限的查询预算下始终优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测黑盒LLM的行为变化，提供了一种可靠的手段来验证模型的一致性。

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的LRMs也存在显著安全漏洞，并分析了不同模型、有害指令类型及输出模式。

Conclusion: HauntAttack揭示了LRMs的安全隐患，为未来模型安全设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

Method: 提出JailFlipBench基准，涵盖单模态、多模态和事实扩展场景，开发JailFlip攻击方法，并在开源和黑盒LLM上全面评估。

Result: 隐性危害对现实世界构成紧迫风险，需扩展传统越狱范式外的安全评估和对齐。

Conclusion: 呼吁更广泛的LLM安全评估和对齐，以应对隐性危害的现实风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

Conclusion: 该框架为EVSE安全提供了可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid
infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and
accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges,
including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the
interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive
security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to
detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new
vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion
detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network
traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework
employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence
across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate
exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the
evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving
response to advanced cyber threats

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized
applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their
ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of
platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows,
reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of
millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector.
Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and
formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and
adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions
have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex
patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This
paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart
contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks,
and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents
code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability
classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy,
interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly,
it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this

Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）在MLLMs中的有效性不确定，且其计算开销大、噪声注入导致模型性能退化，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出Dual-Priv Pruning框架，包括视觉令牌剪枝（减少输入维度）和梯度更新剪枝（基于噪声梯度幅度选择性剪枝）。

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能退化最小的情况下取得竞争性结果，计算效率优于标准DP-SGD，内存效率在H20 GPU上领先。

Conclusion: Dual-Priv Pruning是首个探索MLLMs中DP微调的方法，有效平衡隐私与性能，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted technique, valued for its
effectiveness in protecting the privacy of task-specific datasets, making it a
critical tool for large language models. However, its effectiveness in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying
Differential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation
overhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive
textual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the
injected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,
leading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and
utility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex
architectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a
framework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning
in MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing
redundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP
optimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter
updates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise
impact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
competitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of
computational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than
standard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order
methods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method
demonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to explore DP fine-tuning in MLLMs. Our code is
coming soon.

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks,
operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation,
DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access.
However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously
unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit
web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in
web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter
during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned
injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance
rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations
in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent
contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content
contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through
systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do
Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera
activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and
denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates
of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety
mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites,
creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with
agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive
mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints,
and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure
development and deployment.

*Yuyang Zhou,Guang Cheng,Kang Du,Zihan Chen,Tian Qin,Yuyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦多智能体深度强化学习（FMADRL）的移动目标防御（MTD）框架，用于无人机群网络中的主动和自适应DoS攻击缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机群的开放无线环境、动态拓扑和资源限制使其面临严重的DoS威胁，传统静态或集中式防御机制难以应对。

Method: 设计了三种轻量级协调的MTD机制（领导者切换、路由变异和频率跳变），将防御问题建模为多智能体部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），并采用基于策略梯度的FMADRL算法进行分布式学习。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，攻击缓解率提高34.6%，平均恢复时间减少94.6%，能耗和防御成本分别降低29.3%和98.3%。

Conclusion: FMADRL驱动的MTD框架在动态分布式场景中有效提升了无人机群网络的抗DoS能力和任务持续性。

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于流量隐私保护统计特征的绿色方法，用于识别物联网恶意软件网络攻击，优化了三种树模型的超参数，以降低能耗并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备因资源限制和安全补丁难以应用而容易受到网络攻击，现有机器学习方法多关注攻击检测而忽略计算资源消耗。

Method: 优化决策树、随机森林和Extra-Trees模型的超参数，基于能量消耗和测试性能（马修斯相关系数）进行权衡。

Result: 模型在保持高性能和检测准确率的同时，显著降低了功耗（以瓦时计）。

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的本地入侵检测系统适合物联网和其他资源受限设备。

Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is
growing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive
maintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and
industrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their
resource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,
various cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,
particularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are
based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.
However, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact
of ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green
methodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow
privacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of
three tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are
optimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that models maintain high
performance and detection accuracy while consistently reducing power usage in
terms of watt-hours (Wh). This suggests that on-premise ML-based Intrusion
Detection Systems are suitable for IoT and other resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化Power-to-Gas（P2G）系统的长期经济运营，结合电池储能系统和燃气轮机，并通过改进DRL算法解决延迟奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G技术在整合间歇性可再生能源方面具有潜力，但其经济运营因能源波动和效率问题而复杂。DRL虽有望解决这些问题，但面临延迟奖励的挑战。

Method: 研究通过三个逐步复杂的案例，评估了Deep Q-Networks和Proximal Policy Optimization等DRL算法，并引入预测整合、奖励函数惩罚和战略成本计算等改进。

Result: 改进后的DRL显著提升了P2G系统的经济运营策略能力，克服了初始决策困难，展现了长期储能的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，改进的DRL算法能有效优化P2G系统的长期运营，为可再生能源整合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端口哈密顿系统中参数和结构不确定性的管理问题，同时保持系统固有结构，并提升控制性能与AI可解释性。

Method: 将系统动态分解为右端（RHS）和左端（LHS），分别由非线性控制器和强化学习处理，通过虚拟端口变量连接两部分。

Result: 框架有效管理不确定性，提升性能与可解释性，保证安全性，并简化学习复杂性。

Conclusion: 该混合控制框架为端口哈密顿系统提供了高效解决方案，并为进一步理论研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在缺乏集中协调时安全性难以保障，需解决模型不确定性带来的风险。

Method: 利用指数风险算子的集中化风险敏感安全条件，提出两种分布式策略：最坏情况预测和接近已知安全策略。

Result: 数值评估表明，该方法能在不保守的情况下有效维持系统安全性。

Conclusion: 通过策略切换和风险敏感设计，实现了多智能体系统在不确定性下的安全控制。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种鲁棒的脑启发音频特征提取器（RBA-FE）模型，用于抑郁症诊断，通过改进的分层网络架构和自适应神经元模型提升噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在图像诊断任务中表现优异，但忽略了音频特征。RBA-FE旨在解决音频特征提取中的噪声问题，并提升抑郁症诊断的准确性。

Method: RBA-FE结合六种声学特征，采用改进的脉冲神经元模型（ARSLIF）模拟大脑注意力机制，增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在MODMA数据集上，RBA-FE在精度、准确率、召回率和F1分数上分别达到0.8750、0.8974、0.8750和0.8750，并在其他数据集上验证了噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RBA-FE通过脑启发设计提升了音频特征提取的鲁棒性和可解释性，为抑郁症诊断提供了新方法。

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态后校正框架，通过视频中的上下文信息改进ASR转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在复杂环境（如电视剧）中表现不佳，现有方法未能充分利用视频中的丰富信息。

Method: 两阶段框架：ASR生成和基于视频的后校正，结合VLMM和LLM提取并利用视频上下文信息。

Result: 在电视剧ASR的多模态基准测试中，该方法显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 视频上下文信息能有效提升复杂多媒体环境中的ASR性能。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级单流多模态学习框架，用于音频-视觉深度伪造检测，通过协作学习块和多模态分类模块提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立学习音频和视觉特征，未能充分利用其相关性，且模型冗余，不适用于资源受限环境。

Method: 设计单流网络，引入协作音频-视觉学习块和多模态分类模块，实现连续多模态特征融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，仅需0.48M参数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，能有效检测单模态和多模态深度伪造，且对未见过的伪造类型具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

Motivation: 现有方法在歌曲复杂性和高质量数据稀缺性方面存在局限，导致音质、音乐性、指令跟随和声乐-乐器和谐性不足。

Method: LeVo由LeLM和音乐编解码器组成，采用并行令牌建模、模块化扩展训练策略和多偏好对齐方法（基于DPO）。

Result: 实验表明，LeVo在客观和主观指标上均优于现有方法，消融研究验证了设计的有效性。

Conclusion: LeVo通过创新设计和多偏好对齐，解决了现有歌词到歌曲生成中的关键问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

Motivation: 探索如何利用LLM（如GPT）从需求（如用户故事）直接生成可执行测试代码，为产品所有者提供高效测试方案。

Method: 采用两种方法：1) 直接让LLM从需求生成代码；2) 通过Gherkin语法作为中间步骤。评估了两种方法在代码质量和可读性上的差异。

Result: 两步法（使用Gherkin语法）在代码可读性和最佳实践方面表现更优。结构化提示能生成更高质量的测试输出。

Conclusion: 通过中间步骤（如Gherkin语法）生成测试代码的方法更有效，建议在类似任务中优先采用。

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to
automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More
specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics,
or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This
gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly
produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of
the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code
from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a
result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where
we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e.
lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.
Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple
"Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured
prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子软件工程提供了系统化的重构分类法，有助于改进开发流程和语言兼容性。

Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity
and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent
updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored,
thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring
challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in
classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software.
This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum
circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and
compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in
quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to
categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit
versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an
initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases.
Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These
taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were
integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods.
By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified
taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques.
Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by
enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and
promoting best practices in quantum programming.

Motivation: LLM代理在通过自然语言指令调用API时容易误解用户意图，导致行为偏离目标，而传统测试方法无法处理自然语言的模糊性。

Method: IntenTest利用语义分区组织任务，生成突变任务并通过轻量级预测器排名，同时采用数据类型感知的策略记忆提高效率。

Result: 在80个工具包API上的实验表明，IntenTest显著优于基线方法，能有效发现意图违规且适应性强。

Conclusion: IntenTest为LLM代理的意图完整性测试提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking
APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer
from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that
diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.
Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in
handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an
API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent
integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed
benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on
toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent
errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic
partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories
based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each
partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that
estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,
IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts
effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs
demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,
significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query
efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models
using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across
domains.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Poisson Flow生成模型（ResPF）的高效稀疏视图CT重建方法，通过条件引导和残差融合模块，显著提升了重建质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT可减少辐射剂量，但重建问题复杂，现有深度学习和扩散模型缺乏物理可解释性或计算成本高。

Method: 基于PFGM++，引入条件引导和残差融合模块，跳过冗余初始步骤并嵌入数据一致性，保持轨迹连续性。

Result: 在合成和临床数据集上，ResPF在重建质量、推理速度和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResPF首次将Poisson Flow模型应用于稀疏视图CT，为高效高质量重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

*Sumit Sharma,Gopi Raju Matta,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，将二进制SPC图像转换为高质量彩色新视图，解决了传统3D合成技术因信息丢失而无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPC图像因二进制特性导致纹理和颜色信息严重丢失，传统3D合成技术难以处理。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段用Pix2PixHD进行图像转换，第二阶段用NeRF或3DGS进行3D场景重建。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在感知质量和几何一致性上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段框架有效解决了SPC图像信息丢失问题，提升了3D重建质量。

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Conclusion: 模型通过解耦表示和空间注意力机制，实现了对颜色变化鲁棒的细胞核分割和颜色标准化。

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and
uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is
crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as
Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis
is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt
diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an
automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from
many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various
brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and
Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the
critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and
identification in areas with restricted access to advanced medical
technologies.

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床中至关重要，但现有方法因目标与非目标区域对比度低导致语义表达弱，文本提示信息有潜力解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC)，引入多阶段跨注意力模块和多阶段对齐损失以增强语义细节理解和跨模态一致性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集（QaTa-COV19、MosMedData和Breast）上，TMC的Dice分数分别为84.77%、78.50%和88.73%，优于UNet和现有文本引导方法。

Conclusion: TMC通过改进跨模态交互和特征表达，显著提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有神经B帧编码器，性能接近或超过H.266/VVC参考软件。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了B帧编码的独特挑战，显著提升了压缩性能。

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

Motivation: 当前量子硬件对CX门的连接性有限制，且CX门噪声较大，因此需要优化布局合成以减少CX门数量或深度。

Method: 采用SAT编码和增量SAT求解，结合并行计划，确保找到最小深度或CX门深度的电路。

Result: 新方法比OLSQ2快10-100倍，但深度优化仍比门数优化耗时。模拟显示，同时优化CX门数量和深度能最大程度降低噪声。

Conclusion: 优化CX门数量与噪声降低相关性更强，但结合CX门数量和深度优化效果最佳。

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Conclusion: LIET通过个体与团队的协同学习，显著提升了多智能体LLM的规划和合作能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出Shapley-Coop方法，通过Shapley Chain-of-Thought和结构化谈判协议，解决开放环境中LLM代理的协作与信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏协调规则的开放环境中，LLM代理倾向于自私行为，公平评估贡献和设计定价机制是关键挑战。

Method: 结合Shapley Chain-of-Thought（基于边际贡献定价）和结构化谈判协议，实现任务时间定价和奖励再分配。

Result: 在多种多代理任务中验证，Shapley-Coop显著提升协作效果并实现公平信用分配。

Conclusion: Shapley-Coop的定价机制能准确反映个体贡献，促进LLM代理的协作与自主性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

### [633] [Diffusion of Responsibility in Collective Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07935)
*Pavel Naumov,Jia Tao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文探讨了“责任扩散”现象在集体决策机制中的表现，证明避免责任扩散的唯一方式是让一个代理人独裁决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究责任扩散在集体决策中的影响，探索避免责任扩散的机制设计。

Method: 通过定义决策机制的互模拟，证明互模拟保留责任相关属性，并在最小的互模拟机制中验证结果。

Result: 在双代理人场景中，避免责任扩散的唯一方式是独裁决策；多代理人场景中，需选举独裁者。

Conclusion: 避免责任扩散的集体决策机制必须采用独裁或选举独裁的形式。

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

### [634] [Recursive Semantic Anchoring in ISO 639:2023: A Structural Extension to ISO/TC 37 Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06870)
*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种递归语义锚定方法，用于处理语言变体和混合现象，通过固定点操作符建模语义漂移，并验证了其在语言识别和翻译中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISO 639:2023缺乏处理方言漂移和混合语言的机器原生机制，需要一种能够建模语义漂移的框架。

Method: 提出递归语义锚定方法，使用固定点操作符和漂移向量建模语义漂移，并通过范畴论和函子理论实现收敛。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在语言识别和翻译任务中对噪声或混合输入具有更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容ISO/TC 37，为未来标准提供了支持语义漂移的AI可处理层。

Abstract: ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual
metadata, but it lacks a machine-native mechanism for handling dialectal drift
and creole mixtures. We propose a formalisation of recursive semantic
anchoring, attaching to every language entity $\chi$ a family of fixed-point
operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.

TL;DR: 本文使用Lean 4交互式定理证明器对冯·诺依曼-摩根斯坦（vNM）期望效用定理进行了全面的形式化，验证了偏好关系的数学结构及其效用表示的存在性与唯一性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为经济建模、AI对齐和管理决策系统提供严格的理论基础，填补理论决策理论与计算实现之间的空白。

Method: 实现偏好完备性、传递性、连续性和独立性等经典公理，通过机器验证证明效用表示的存在性与唯一性。

Result: 验证了满足vNM公理的偏好可以通过期望效用最大化表示，并提供了混合彩票基本主张的形式化证明。

Conclusion: 该形式化为理论决策理论的应用提供了精确的计算实现，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of the von
Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility theorem using the Lean 4 interactive
theorem prover. We implement the classical axioms of preference-completeness,
transitivity, continuity, and independence-enabling machine-verified proofs of
both the existence and uniqueness of utility representations. Our formalization
captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries,
verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by
expected utility maximization.
  Our contributions include a granular implementation of the independence
axiom, formally verified proofs of fundamental claims about mixture lotteries,
constructive demonstrations of utility existence, and computational experiments
validating the results. We prove equivalence to classical presentations while
offering greater precision at decision boundaries.
  This formalization provides a rigorous foundation for applications in
economic modeling, AI alignment, and management decision systems, bridging the
gap between theoretical decision theory and computational implementation.

Abstract: We present Pendulum Tracker, a computer vision-based application that enables
real-time measurement of the oscillatory motion of a physical pendulum.
Integrated into the educational platform SimuF\'isica, the system uses the
OpenCV.js library and runs directly in the browser, working on computers,
tablets, and smartphones. The application automatically detects the pendulum's
