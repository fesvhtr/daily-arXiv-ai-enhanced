While\nresearchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of\npersuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion\nresides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in\ncurrent visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis\nof octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across\ncenturies and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema\ntheory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th\ncentury to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement\ntheir persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual\nmetaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies\nare applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the\nabove analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u57fa\u7840\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55AI\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u57fa\u7840\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u6b65\u6765\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "SGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u65f6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Accepted to COLM 2025", "summary": "Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and\nmachine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and\nadapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution\noften is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software\ndependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves\naverage F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%\nidentifying transitive cell execution dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5CRABS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u56fe\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u6267\u884c\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CRABS\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d45\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u548cAST\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5LLM\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4e2d\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2aKaggle\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cLLM\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8698%\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\uff0cCRABS\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523098%\u548c99%\u3002", "conclusion": "CRABS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large\npattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving\nheuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to\nexploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU\ncomputations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations\nin depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded\ndepth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of\nmodern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \\emph{Batch IDA*},\nan extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an\nextensions of Budgeted Tree Search.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness\nin spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully\nobservable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt\nChinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate\nrules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such\nenvironments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a\nlarge-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert\nannotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nXiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning\nfor legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating\nstrategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying\nreinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with\nmulti-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability.

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our\nmethod effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details\nafter demodulation.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

However, their performance has mostly been tested\nin the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or\nabdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more\nchallenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO.

The resulting\ntissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver\nassociated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the\nvocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal\nliver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method\nidentifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and\nenables a better separation between treatment groups than established\nnon-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy\nderived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a\nseparate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed\nmethod.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u809d\u810fMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5f25\u6f2b\u6027\u809d\u75c5\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7597\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u809d\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6d3b\u68c0\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u809d\u75c5\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling.

Moreover, we\nintroduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes\ncorrespondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted\nscene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,\nwe align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby\nobtaining a coarse pose estimation.

Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with\naudio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results\nsuggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly\nimproves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared\nagainst the same network trained from scratch without pretraining.

While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,\nexisting NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on\nsingle-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view\ndata, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view\nlevel, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel\nclasses, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into\nview-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes.

Subsequently, the\ndecoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial\nsemantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and\nrefined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the\ninherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD\ndatasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by\ngeneration strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the\nabove components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four\nMR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art models by a margin.

Our techniques enable the first-ever training\nof an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing\npeak memory usage by up to 89\\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over\nstandard DDP with 128 GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "PGT-I\u6269\u5c55\u4e86PyTorch Geometric Temporal\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff08index-batching\u548cdistributed-index-batching\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ST-GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86ST-GNN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPGT-I\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5feb\u7167\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u6280\u672f\uff08index-batching\u548cdistributed-index-batching\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728PeMS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u56fe\u5206\u533a\u7684ST-GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1189%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534713.1\u500d\uff08128 GPU\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "PGT-I\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper details\nour championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 \"Finding Birds\" Small\nMulti-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the\ntracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection\nand association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training\nenhancement framework named \\textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the\nsynergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic\naugmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for\nsmall objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we\ndesigned a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance\ninformation. By integrating a \\textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}\nmechanism and an \\textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \\textbf{bounding\nbox expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can\nstably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities.

First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse\nlongitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different\nurban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building\noutlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles\nthroughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are\naligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade\npatterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to\nlearn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,\ntime of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in\ngenerating shade images.

In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales.

To overcome these dual challenges, we\npropose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)\nframework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with\nthe non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids\ncontaining MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique\ntransformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on\nspatial coordinates and intensity values.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset\nconsisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform\nillumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate\nthat our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while\neffectively recovering high-frequency information.

While current state-of-the-art methods rely\non discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that\ngenerative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can\nachieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior\nassumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,\ndomain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms\ndomain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with\nmIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction.

CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features\napart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull\ntogether features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our\nmethod achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on\nCIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18\nbackbone.

We identify a critical insight:\nhallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and\npropagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**\n(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain\npr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human\nannotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference\npairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence\nthrough cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying\nsentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use\ncontext-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build\ncontext-aware preference data iteratively.

However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for\npricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and\nscale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing\n(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these\nchallenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic\nInformation Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract\nessential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from\nSaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,\nencompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's\neffectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,\nchallenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic\ncontent. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing\ntransformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for\nimproved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing\nlandscape.

Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including\nboth value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems\nsuch as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state\ndiagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both\nnoiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric\nthat balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational\nefficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first\nreveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational\nclassifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally\noptimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly\ncontext-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This\nempirical finding provides strong evidence for the \"no free lunch\" principle in\nRL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored\nalgorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit\nsynthesis.

However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced\npackaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of\nthe layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables\nthe imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective\nin NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This\nconversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for\nmagnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy\ncurrent effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we\npresent a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample\nscanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.\nThe SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by\naligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect\nusing both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)\nmagnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment\nof the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an\ninversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by\nintegrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM\nimproves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.\nAlso, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a\nreal image.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection.

If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.\nThis issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual\nlearning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge\nintegration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model\nmerging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the\nparameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on\ndifferent domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which\nminimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the\ndomain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge\nwhile maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant\nregardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.\nExperimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual\nlearning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its\neffectiveness in dynamic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRegCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRegCL\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RegCL\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u91cd\u653e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

However, the quadratic\ncomplexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures\nmake them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a\nparadigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and\nhybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses\non the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic\nperformance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically\nneeded to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.\n  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of\ncarefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for\nlong-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that\nSSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing\nsequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than\ncomparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short\nsequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x\nfaster at very long contexts (~57K tokens).

We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking\ncontext for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and\nACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative\npriority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.\nMeasurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,\nshowing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,\nwhich uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps\nelicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally\nsynthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our\ntreatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates\ncan be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and\ncan lead to different global behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edfClarify\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Disambiguator\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u8def\u7531\u6620\u5c04\u548cACL\uff09\u65f6\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u6a21\u7cca\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faClarify\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cDisambiguator\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d88\u9664\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u5408\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0cClarify\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "Clarify\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5408\u6210\u610f\u56fe\u4f46\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002"}}
