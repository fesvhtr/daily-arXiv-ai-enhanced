### [1] [Context-aware TFL: A Universal Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08493)
*Qilin Yin,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的上下文感知对比学习框架（UniCaCLF），用于解决多媒体取证领域中部分视频片段被篡改的时域伪造定位（TFL）问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多将深度伪造检测视为分类任务，忽略了视频部分片段被篡改的情况，而时域伪造定位更具现实应用价值。

Method: 采用监督对比学习，通过异常检测识别伪造片段，并提出上下文感知感知层和自适应上下文更新器，构建上下文感知对比目标，增强伪造片段特征的区分性。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明，UniCaCLF显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: UniCaCLF为时域伪造定位提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on
detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However,
these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and
ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal
forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real
videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application
scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware
contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages
supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by
means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal
forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer
that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context
updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the
discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine
instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An
efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the
limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants
in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence
to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental
results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

### [2] [Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction for Efficient Large Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08591)
*Chengchao Shen,Hourun Zhu,Gongfan Fang,Jianxin Wang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性引导的MLP压缩方法（DGMR），显著减少大型视觉Transformer的参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模Transformer模型参数过多导致计算和内存成本高昂，MLP模块占用了大部分参数。

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略，消除MLP隐藏层的冗余神经元，同时保留权重多样性以提升蒸馏性能。

Result: 在多个大型视觉Transformer上，DGMR实现了57%以上的参数和FLOPs减少，性能损失极小。EVA-CLIP-E（4.4B）的参数和FLOPs减少了71.5%，且性能无下降。

Conclusion: DGMR是一种高效的大规模视觉Transformer压缩方法，显著减少资源消耗，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

### [3] [Towards Reliable AR-Guided Surgical Navigation: Interactive Deformation Modeling with Data-Driven Biomechanics and Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08048)
*Zheng Han,Jun Zhou,Jialun Pei,Jing Qin,Yingfang Fan,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的生物力学算法，结合人机交互机制，用于AR手术导航中的变形建模，提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FEM）计算成本高且难以处理大范围解剖变化，导致AR导航不准确。

Method: 结合数据驱动的生物力学算法和人机交互机制，动态调整变形模型。

Result: 算法平均目标配准误差为3.42 mm，结合交互提示后降至2.78 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效准确的变形建模，提升了手术导航的可靠性，为计算机辅助手术提供了新方向。

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

### [4] [ReCogDrive: A Reinforced Cognitive Framework for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08052)
*Yongkang Li,Kaixin Xiong,Xiangyu Guo,Fang Li,Sixu Yan,Gangwei Xu,Lijun Zhou,Long Chen,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Guang Chen,Hangjun Ye,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCogDrive提出了一种结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和扩散规划器的自动驾驶系统，通过三阶段训练解决领域差距、维度不匹配和模仿学习问题，在NAVSIM基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶在罕见和长尾场景中性能下降的问题，同时克服现有方法中领域差距、维度不匹配和模仿学习的局限性。

Method: 采用三阶段训练：1）使用大规模驾驶问答数据集训练VLM；2）基于扩散的规划器进行模仿学习；3）通过强化学习微调规划器。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中达到89.6 PDMS，超越此前最佳视觉方法5.6 PDMS。

Conclusion: ReCogDrive通过结合VLM和扩散规划器，显著提升了自动驾驶在复杂场景中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its
performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world
knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from
several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data
of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the
discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation
learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which
may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an
autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which
adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a
large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating
the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving
scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform
imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to
continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using
reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model
to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our
approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6
and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA
by 5.6 PDMS.

### [5] [CuRe: Cultural Gaps in the Long Tail of Text-to-Image Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08071)
*Aniket Rege,Zinnia Nie,Mahesh Ramesh,Unmesh Raskar,Zhuoran Yu,Aditya Kusupati,Yong Jae Lee,Ramya Korlakai Vinayak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuRe是一个用于评估文本到图像（T2I）系统文化代表性的新基准和评分套件，通过分析系统对文本条件增加的响应来量化文化偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I系统训练数据主要来自欧美，忽略了全球南方的文化多样性，导致文化代表性不足。

Method: CuRe利用Wikimedia知识图谱构建了一个包含300种文化产物的层次化数据集，通过分析T2I系统对文本条件增加的响应来评估其文化代表性。

Result: CuRe评分器与人类在感知相似性、图像-文本对齐和文化多样性方面的判断高度相关，适用于多种图像编码器和T2I系统。

Conclusion: CuRe提供了一种可扩展的方法来量化T2I系统的文化偏差，有助于推动更公平的AI系统开发。

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is
heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global
South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable
benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages
the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for
human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy
built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural
artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes
(food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's
categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing
their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling
fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger
correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual
similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders
(SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2,
Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three
variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0,
and DALL-E 3. The code and dataset is open-sourced and available at
https://aniketrege.github.io/cure/.

### [6] [IGraSS: Learning to Identify Infrastructure Networks from Satellite Imagery by Iterative Graph-constrained Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08137)
*Oishee Bintey Hoque,Abhijin Adiga,Aniruddha Adiga,Siddharth Chaudhary,Madhav V. Marathe,S. S. Ravi,Kirti Rajagopalan,Amanda Wilson,Samarth Swarup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGraSS是一个结合语义分割和图优化的框架，用于改进运河网络映射，通过迭代优化地面真实数据，显著减少不可达运河段并提升识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割模型依赖高质量标注数据，但地面真实数据的不完整或不足会影响性能。基础设施网络（如运河、道路）具有图级特性（如可达性、连通性），可用于优化地面真实数据。

Method: IGraSS结合RGB和多模态数据（NDWI、DEM）的语义分割模块与基于图的优化模块，迭代优化地面真实数据。

Result: IGraSS将不可达运河段从约18%降至3%，使用优化后的数据显著提升运河识别效果，并在道路网络中验证了通用性。

Conclusion: IGraSS是一个鲁棒的框架，可用于优化噪声地面真实数据并映射基础设施网络，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

### [7] [Spectral Domain Neural Reconstruction for Passband FMCW Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08163)
*Harshvardhan Takawale,Nirupam Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpINRv2是一个基于神经网络的框架，用于使用FMCW雷达进行高保真体积重建。它通过频域前向模型和隐式神经表示（INR）解决了高频下的相位混叠和子箱模糊问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高频FMCW雷达中相位混叠和子箱模糊问题，提升体积重建的精度。

Method: 引入完全可微的频域前向模型和隐式神经表示（INR），结合稀疏性和平滑性正则化。

Result: SpINRv2在高频条件下显著优于传统和基于学习的方法，成为神经雷达3D成像的新基准。

Conclusion: SpINRv2通过频域建模和INR实现了高保真体积重建，为高频雷达成像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric
reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar.
Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that
allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and
sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully
differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar
response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural
representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike
time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency
spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to
disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.
Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical
and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,
establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

### [8] [Surgeon Style Fingerprinting and Privacy Risk Quantification via Discrete Diffusion Models in a Vision-Language-Action Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08185)
*Huixin Zhan,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散扩散框架和视觉-语言-动作（VLA）管道的方法，用于建模外科医生在机器人手术中的个性化操作风格，同时探讨了隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统常忽略外科医生的个性化操作风格，而本文旨在通过多模态输入（如视频、手术意图语言和隐私感知嵌入）捕捉这种个性化信号。

Method: 采用离散扩散框架和VLA管道，将手势预测建模为结构化序列去噪任务，并通过自然语言提示编码外科医生的个性化指纹。

Result: 在JIGSAWS数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够准确重建手势序列并学习每位外科医生的独特运动指纹，但也发现更个性化的嵌入会增加身份泄露风险。

Conclusion: 个性化嵌入虽能提升性能，但也增加了隐私风险，需在个性化与隐私保护之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-World SGG是一种无需训练、高效的框架，利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）直接生成场景图，无需额外学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于数据集特定的监督或微调，限制了在开放世界环境中的适用性。

Method: 通过多模态提示、嵌入对齐和轻量级配对优化策略，将SGG转化为零样本结构化推理问题。

Result: 在Visual Genome、Open Images V6和PSG数据集上的实验表明，预训练的VLMs能够无需任务级训练即可进行关系理解。

Conclusion: Open-World SGG展示了预训练VLMs在开放世界场景图生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and
distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on
dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting
their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or
relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs)
typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG,
a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into
the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional
learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method
combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight
pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies
and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World
evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have
been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual
Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate
the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without
task-level training.

*Antoni Nowinowski,Krzysztof Krawiec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了DVP（视觉先验解缠器）架构，使其能处理场景中的多个对象，并通过改进训练方式提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原始DVP无法处理多对象场景的问题，并利用其可解释性改进训练效率。

Method: 扩展DVP以处理多对象，利用解码器生成额外训练样本，并在图像和潜在空间定义损失函数。

Result: 在重建质量和对象分解能力上优于基线模型（MONet和LIVE）。

Conclusion: 通过改进训练方式和损失函数，DVP在多对象场景中表现优异，但可微渲染在自编码器中仍有局限性。

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors
(DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the
perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation,
and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which
control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that
the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In
this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects
in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the
decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative
training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,
but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is
otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the
image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,
we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the
previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We
compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and
demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to
decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the
considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training,
and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the
ways in which they can be addressed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIQ是一个用于评估视觉和视觉语言基础模型几何推理能力的综合基准，揭示了当前模型在几何理解上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在标准基准上表现良好，但对几何属性的真实理解尚不明确，需要专门的评估工具。

Method: GIQ包含224种多面体的合成和真实图像，通过单目3D重建、3D对称检测、心理旋转测试和零样本形状分类任务进行系统实验。

Result: 当前模型在基本几何形状重建、详细几何区分和复杂多面体理解上表现不佳。

Conclusion: GIQ为几何智能研究提供了结构化平台，有助于未来几何感知表示学习的进步。

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs)
demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true
understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric
reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ
comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including
Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and
compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through
systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry
detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we
reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to
reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models
effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they
falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation,
such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit
remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting
basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is
publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address
critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in
robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用现代仅解码器LLM作为文本编码器在文本到图像扩散模型中的效果，发现多层归一化平均嵌入优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型仍使用过时的T5和CLIP作为文本编码器，探索现代LLM的潜力。

Method: 构建标准化训练与评估流程，训练27个模型，分析LLM嵌入提取方式、变体和模型大小的影响。

Result: 多层归一化平均嵌入显著提升复杂提示对齐性能，多数LLM优于基线T5模型。

Conclusion: 现代LLM作为文本编码器可提升文本到图像生成性能，尤其在复杂视觉语言推理任务中。

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模型依赖大量人工标注数据的高成本问题。

Result: 自监督集成模型在测试集上的IOU指标比全监督单模型提高了0.02。

Conclusion: 自监督方法在减少标注成本的同时，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite
images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the
remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models
require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow
and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training
methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In
this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to
train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water
from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement
an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance.
Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our
ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the
Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过学习2D关键点提升到3D空间的方法，以解决语义对应中稀疏标注关键点泛化能力不足的问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督语义对应方法受限于稀疏标注关键点的泛化能力，无法有效学习密集对应关系。

Method: 通过单目深度估计将2D关键点提升到3D规范空间，构建连续规范流形，无需显式3D监督或相机标注。

Result: 模型在未见关键点上显著优于监督基线，且无监督基线在不同数据集上泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在语义对应任务中表现出更强的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful
matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how
recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize
beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint
detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense
correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using
monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical
manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D
supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an
extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess
generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its
effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised
baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示现有视觉语言组合理解基准测试中的设计偏差，并探讨如何构建更鲁棒的测试。

Method: 通过分析基准测试的数据来源和构建过程，识别偏差，并提出改进建议。

Result: 发现基准测试存在分布不对称性，导致简单启发式方法与CLIP模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 建议改进基准测试构建方法以减少偏差，提升评估效果。

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for
measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data
source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative
images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We
find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language
model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not
effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the
underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative
images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate
these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust
vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less
prone to such simple attacks.

*L. Lao Beyer,T. Li,X. Chen,S. Karaman,K. He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 1D图像分词器通过高度压缩的一维序列表示图像，支持启发式操作实现图像编辑和生成，无需训练生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索1D图像分词器在高度压缩下的表达能力，以及其在图像编辑和生成中的潜力。

Method: 使用基于梯度的测试时优化和即插即用的损失函数（如重建或CLIP相似性）构建图像生成流程。

Result: 实现了细粒度图像编辑和多样化、逼真的样本生成，适用于修复和文本引导编辑。

Conclusion: 1D图像分词器在高效压缩和灵活操作方面表现出色，为图像生成和编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage是一个音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频。它结合语音合成技术，实现多模态视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频的音频和图像序列的和谐结合对视频效果至关重要，但现有方法要么忽略声音，要么局限于特定领域。

Method: 提出一种统一的训练方法，基于自注意力机制，从零开始或基于现有权重训练音频到视频生成模型。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，且保持了通用性。

Conclusion: Mirage为音频到视频生成提供了高质量且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEMA的新型注意力机制，解决了传统注意力机制在计算复杂度和聚焦能力上的不足，并通过数学证明和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制（如全注意力和线性注意力）在计算机视觉任务中存在计算复杂度高和无法有效聚焦的问题。

Method: 通过数学定义广义注意力，并设计SEMA机制，利用令牌定位避免分散，同时结合算术平均捕获全局注意力。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上的分类实验中，SEMA在更大规模的图像上表现优于线性注意力和近期视觉Mamba模型。

Conclusion: SEMA是一种可扩展且高效的注意力机制，适用于大规模视觉任务。

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and
computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the
lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our
approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the
collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent
natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a
Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which
contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in
the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and
benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments.

TL;DR: STNet是一种新型网络架构，通过空间-光谱Transformer模块的创新设计，有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的过拟合和泛化能力问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、地物稀疏分布和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力受限。

Method: STNet采用空间-光谱Transformer模块，通过显式解耦空间和光谱注意力，并结合两种功能不同的门控机制（自适应注意力融合门控和GFFN），实现高效特征提取与融合。

Result: STNet在IN、UP和KSC数据集上表现优异，优于主流高光谱图像分类方法。

Conclusion: STNet在不增加网络深度或宽度的情况下，提升了模型表示能力，适用于小样本和高噪声场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract
and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called
STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its
Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling
of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information
in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent
regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention
fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This
characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing
overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances
model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,
outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用事件相机实时定位网球拍击球位置的方法，解决了高速摄像机内存消耗大和人工数字化耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在网球等球拍运动中，准确测量击球位置对分析球员表现和个性化装备设计至关重要，但现有方法存在内存消耗大和人工误差的问题。

Method: 采用事件相机高效捕捉亮度变化，结合传统计算机视觉技术和原创的事件处理方法（PATS）分三步识别：挥拍时间范围、击球时机、球和球拍轮廓。

Result: 实验结果在测量网球球员表现的可接受范围内，且计算时间足够短，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实时定位击球位置，为球员表现分析提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is
important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in
personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the
impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged
scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming
and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively
capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's
performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the
racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure
brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed
motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to
continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method
consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,
and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are
utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at
impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results
of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis
players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for
real-time applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Step AG的自适应引导策略，通过限制分类器自由引导在前几个去噪步骤中应用，显著提升了生成效率，同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分类器自由引导方法在生成过程中需要两倍的计算步骤，导致成本显著增加。虽然已有自适应引导的概念，但缺乏深入分析和实证结果，无法广泛应用于扩散模型。

Method: 提出Step AG策略，将分类器自由引导限制在前几个去噪步骤中，以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和文本对齐方面表现良好，平均加速20%至30%，且在不同设置和模型中具有一致性。

Conclusion: Step AG是一种简单、通用的自适应引导策略，显著提升了扩散模型的生成效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

Result: 实验表明，MedMoE在多种医学基准测试中提升了模态对齐和检索性能。

Conclusion: 模态特异性视觉表征对临床视觉-语言系统具有重要价值。

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at
varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained
localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the
medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,
overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a
modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically
adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE
incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,
which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches
trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate
over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling
spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework
produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,
without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results
on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and
retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of
modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language
systems.

Conclusion: DCID方法通过双摄像头融合有效去除摩尔纹，且性能优越。

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured
images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing
methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address
the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing
(DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e
removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the
two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image
generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W
image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an
efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into
an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is
present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse
mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the
dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the
performance of existing VLMs remains hindered by object hallucination, a
critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this
issue, we propose SECOND: Selective and Contrastive Decoding, a novel approach
that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with
an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND
progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information,
facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these
visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual
hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical
analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of
multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting

Motivation: 现有方法难以结合无线电地图的物理特性，导致稀疏样本下密集地图估计效果不佳。

Method: 将无线电地图估计建模为稀疏信号恢复问题，结合物理传播模型分解为多因子优化子问题，提出RadioDUN和DRM模块，并设计阴影损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RadioDUN通过结合物理特性和自适应学习，显著提升了无线电地图估计的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: SCALE提出了一种基于数据质量驱动的视觉语言模型（VLM）指令调优数据集选择方法，通过跨模态评估框架解决图像与文本对齐噪声和文本模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）的效果依赖于大规模高质量数据集，但图像与文本对齐噪声和文本模糊问题阻碍了进展。

Method: SCALE通过跨模态评估框架，为每个数据条目分配任务、生成多类型描述，并评估对齐性、清晰度等指标。

Result: 发现现有单模态质量评估方法低估了特定任务所需样本，且适当生成的图像描述可将多模态任务转化为统一文本模态。

Conclusion: SCALE为提升VLM性能提供了一种高效的数据选择方法，强调了跨模态评估的重要性。

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training
techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with
more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs
is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise
recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)
noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to
misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual
content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data
quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data
selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE
integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data
entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and
task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates
the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each
entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal
quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,
which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the
lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately
generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text
multimodal task into a unified text modality.

Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成方法因过早暴露高频细节导致视频动态性不足，需要一种方法在保持图像质量的同时增强动态性。

Method: 提出ALG方法，通过在去噪早期阶段自适应低通滤波调节输入图像频率内容。

Result: ALG在VBench-I2V测试中平均提升36%的动态性，且视频质量和图像保真度无明显下降。

Conclusion: ALG是一种简单有效的解决方案，显著提升I2V生成的动态性，同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability,
recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support
image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses
motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared
to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and
identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in
the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory
that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,
we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model
sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising
per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency
content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early
stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly
improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image
fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG
achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant
drop in video quality or image fidelity.

object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved
sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of
hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using
NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or
surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned
from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling
transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a
self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient
datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features
from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the
unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts
full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of
500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature
transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

### [30] [MLVTG: Mamba-Based Feature Alignment and LLM-Driven Purification for Multi-Modal Video Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08512)
*Zhiyi Zhu,Xiaoyu Wu,Zihao Liu,Linlin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLVTG是一种新颖的视频时间定位框架，通过MambaAligner和LLMRefiner模块解决现有Transformer方法的冗余注意力和多模态对齐问题，实现了更精确的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法存在冗余注意力和多模态对齐不足的问题，影响了视频时间定位的准确性。

Method: MLVTG结合MambaAligner（使用Vision Mamba块建模时间依赖）和LLMRefiner（利用预训练LLM的特定层传递语义先验），实现双对齐策略。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和TVSum数据集上，MLVTG表现优于现有基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MLVTG通过时间建模和语义净化，显著提升了视频时间定位的准确性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

*Zhongtao Tian,Wenhao Huang,Zhidong Chen,Xiao Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多尺度特征学习和语义场景理解的框架，用于动态环境中的视觉定位，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中光照、天气和移动物体等因素干扰视觉定位，现有绝对姿态回归方法难以保持一致。

Method: 采用分层Transformer和跨尺度注意力融合几何细节与上下文线索，结合语义监督学习视图不变特征。

Result: 在TartanAir数据集上，该方法在动态物体、光照变化和遮挡等挑战性场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度处理与语义指导的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒视觉定位提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where
fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance
cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose
regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines
multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach
employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric
details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to
environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with
semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding
the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural
information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments
on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression
methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes,
and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with
semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in
real-world dynamic environments.

### [32] [LiftVSR: Lifting Image Diffusion to Video Super-Resolution via Hybrid Temporal Modeling with Only 4$\times$RTX 4090s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08529)
*Xijun Wang,Xin Li,Bingchen Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiftVSR是一个高效的视频超分辨率框架，通过结合动态时间注意力和注意力记忆缓存，显著提升了时间一致性并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在时间一致性和计算成本方面存在不足，尤其是对长视频处理时。

Method: 提出LiftVSR框架，结合动态时间注意力（DTA）和注意力记忆缓存（AMC），并采用非对称采样策略优化缓存交互。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出色，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: LiftVSR在提升视频超分辨率性能的同时，有效解决了计算效率问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by
enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal
modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually
suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational
costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for
long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that
leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$,
achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To
balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal
modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary
components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal
modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)
Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments
($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token
flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame
contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment
information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal
overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we
introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches
arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on
several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves
impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，高效准确的运动预测对安全和决策至关重要，尤其是在动态多模态场景下。现有生成方法存在计算效率低和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出TrajFlow框架，采用流匹配技术单次预测多轨迹；引入基于Plackett-Luce分布的排序损失优化不确定性估计；设计自条件训练技术提升泛化能力。

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上，TrajFlow在多项关键指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TrajFlow为安全关键型自动驾驶应用提供了高效、准确的运动预测解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on
the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

Method: 提出ISLH假设，并开发SPP框架，分析深度网络中线性表示的逐步提炼过程，通过视觉语言模型验证其多模态鲁棒性。

Result: SPP框架成功揭示了深度网络中线性表示的形成路径，并在视觉语言模型中表现出多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度网络表示形成提供了结构化理论，有助于提升AI的鲁棒性、公平性和透明度。

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI
transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or
circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable
concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose
the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned
directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with
increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP)
framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear
representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on
this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these
representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical
insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of
representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI
robustness, fairness, and transparency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需校准的跨受试者肌电图（EMG）模式识别方法，通过特征解耦实现高效泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨受试者EMG模式识别因个体差异面临挑战，传统方法依赖校准数据，耗时且不实用。

Method: 采用双分支对抗神经网络，将EMG特征解耦为模式特定和受试者特定成分，实现端到端识别。

Result: 模型在未见用户数据上表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无校准跨受试者EMG识别提供了新思路，并具有广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant
challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

Abstract: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance
improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects
frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually
learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental
Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing
models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged
inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called
Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both
efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for
imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.

Motivation: 现有VLN数据集缺乏细粒度的跨模态对齐标注，限制了智能体在导航任务中的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出FCA-NIG框架，通过子轨迹分割、地标检测、指令生成和实体选择，自动生成带有子指令-轨迹和实体-地标对齐的FCA-R2R数据集。

Result: 实验表明，使用FCA-R2R训练的VLN智能体（如SF、EnvDrop等）性能显著提升，尤其在状态感知和导航准确性方面。

Conclusion: FCA-NIG无需人工标注即可生成高质量训练数据，推动了复杂导航任务中细粒度跨模态学习的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate
environments by integrating visual perception and natural language
instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily
focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting
sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate
navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose
FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation
instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this
framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories,
which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted
instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation,
and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs
with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to
form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the
FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise
sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the
performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop,
RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances
agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment
further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results
highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable
training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal
learning in complex navigation tasks.

emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the
first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The

pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction,
multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,
and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda
prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models,
illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable
attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining,

Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）和对抗鲁棒性蒸馏（ARD）存在鲁棒公平性问题，即模型对某些类别的鲁棒性较强，而对其他类别的鲁棒性较弱。本文旨在探索这一问题的原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation（ABSLD），通过动态调整教师模型软标签的类别平滑度，减少学生模型在不同类别上的误差风险差距。

Result: 实验表明，ABSLD在鲁棒性和公平性的综合表现上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ABSLD是一种有效且适应性强的解决方案，可以提升对抗训练的公平性。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to
enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT,
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in
enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust
fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness
against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial
robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying
factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for
different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical
observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we
propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge
Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.
Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between
different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness
degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment
is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.
Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be
integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate
ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of
robustness and fairness.

Motivation: 海洋漂浮物在中等分辨率图像中难以可视化，专家通常依赖经验和启发式方法选择波段。SAMSelect旨在通过自动化选择最佳波段组合，提高分类和视觉解释的准确性。

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel
visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use
for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in
Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to
their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these
difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains
a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a
case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect
selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification
accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its
central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most
accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for
photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine
debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets
from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously
unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which
demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We
describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository
that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation,
especially in the marine field.

Conclusion: 通过改进采样策略和引入新型损失函数，论文在3D重建和渲染方面取得了更优效果，尤其针对场景中的关键区域。

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly
improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D
scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can
train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every
pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability
issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D
points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the
sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage
the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a
probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more
targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved
rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for
improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image
projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space
components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into
current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more
accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,
especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context
modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,

Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion

TL;DR: RoboSwap是一个结合GAN和扩散模型的视频编辑框架，用于在未配对数据中替换机器人手臂，解决了跨平台机器人学习中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频合成和编辑技术虽有进步，但高质量数据集的稀缺限制了机器人学习的跨平台泛化能力。RoboSwap旨在解决这一问题，通过替换视频中的机器人手臂，推动跨具身学习。

Method: RoboSwap采用GAN和扩散模型结合的管道：先用GAN在未配对数据中翻译机器人手臂，再用扩散模型增强视频的连贯性和运动真实性。

Result: 实验表明，RoboSwap在三个基准测试中优于现有视频和图像编辑模型，表现出更高的结构连贯性和运动一致性。

Conclusion: RoboSwap为机器人学习提供了可靠的跨具身数据生成解决方案，显著减少了数据收集需求。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis
and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues
to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform
generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic
arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike
previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same
environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired
data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap
introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion
models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic
arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one
robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video
background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion
realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained
independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms
state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of
both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust
solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式表示的快速、准确的无组织点云表面重建算法，解决了现有方法在细节与速度之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法要么需要针对单个对象训练的小模型（细节丰富但泛化能力差），要么使用大模型（泛化能力强但细节不足且推理慢），需要一种兼顾速度与性能的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的隐式表示方法，通过三个关键贡献实现最佳精度-速度权衡：1）延迟查询点特征提取；2）并行多尺度网格表示；3）跨尺度注意力机制。

Result: 新方法在速度上优于所有基线，且性能接近最先进水平，实现了最佳的精度-速度权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新特征提取和多尺度表示，显著提升了点云表面重建的速度与精度。

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for
unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning
methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that
allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized
representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but
lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation
for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum
resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the
state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key
contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to
classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed
up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to
use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel
multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise
levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can
provide improved reconstruction results.

Conclusion: 通过方向对齐的3D生成，解决了现有模型的局限性，并展示了其在下游任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image,
guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative
models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data,
limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce
the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from
single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate
this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D
models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two
representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D
variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize
well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches.
Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object
generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via
analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

Result: 在两个视频记忆性预测数据集上达到最先进性能，并在视频摘要任务中验证了MWCVS的有效性。

Conclusion: TMCCL和MWCVS展示了视频记忆性预测的潜力及其在视频摘要中的应用前景。

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after
viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable.
Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict
video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The
representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase
of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper,
we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal
video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of
motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature
representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to
establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This
enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for
semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability
predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video
memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video
memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we
present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using
video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization
labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video
memorability prediction.

Motivation: 多相机系统中因传感器和光学差异导致颜色不一致，现有方法在适应性、计算成本或实用性上存在不足。

Method: NPM通过模拟特定光照下的原始图像，估计设备间的转换关系，支持物理测量初始化及有无配对数据的训练。

Result: 在NUS和BeyondRGB数据集上，NPM表现优于现有方法，实现了跨传感器和光学系统的颜色一致性。

Conclusion: NPM是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于多相机系统的颜色一致性需求。

Abstract: Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential
for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in
modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and
optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor
adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical
requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping
fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight,
physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified
illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively
adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical
measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on
public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across
different sensors and optical systems.

Motivation: 多任务学习存在任务平衡和扩展成本问题，持续学习虽有望解决，但现有方法忽视基础模型退化。

Result: LLaVA-c在持续学习中表现优于多任务联合学习，保持通用能力。

Conclusion: 首次证明任务级持续学习可媲美或多任务联合学习，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度、区域级理解上表现不足，影响了其在密集预测任务中的效果。

Method: 通过Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS)方法，利用模型自身的知识在多层次表示上同时增强语义一致性和细粒度对齐，仅需未标注图像和内部自蒸馏过程。

Result: 在开放词汇目标检测和语义分割任务中，ATAS显著优于基线CLIP模型。

Conclusion: ATAS验证了同时保持语义一致性和细粒度对齐对高级开放词汇密集预测任务的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual
concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level
understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We
identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic
coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation
methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic
coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To
overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel
approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained
alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation
levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal
self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,
preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail
recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation
benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline
CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and
underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and
fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

Result: 多模态输入模型表现最佳，2023年野火季节F1分数达60.3%。

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent
history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting
large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a
climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season
that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower
wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.
Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the
likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future
wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data
has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,
aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and
temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on
coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to
wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim
0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and
baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,
leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite
images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and
environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two
major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal
inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a
peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season
never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of
multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution
and continental scale.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in

In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances
Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms.
VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search
tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a
comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward
mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of
sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues,
all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting
methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal

of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction

Conclusion: 该方法通过运动作为隐式监督信号，学习到跨帧泛化的表示，显著提升了动态场景下的性能。

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel-
and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging
due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they
rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,
and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We
propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense
point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By
leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion
trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based
optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster
assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views
despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory
signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,
improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By
initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for
training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video
datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly

Conclusion: TraGraph-GS方法显著改进了大规模场景的渲染质量和效率，为3D计算机视觉提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a
challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition
large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using
Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view
rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not
generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques
struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions
results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these
challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable
high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a
spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which
incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures
and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate
artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight
its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86
dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient
encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding
language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene
understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three
main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene
optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are
evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close
to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D
understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark
that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D
space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor
dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable
paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast
feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation
performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS
dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from
multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could
harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made
public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

Motivation: 当前AAA监测依赖最大直径，忽略了3D形状与生长的复杂关系，标准化监测间隔可能不适用。个性化生长预测可优化监测策略。

Method: 使用SE(3)-对称变换器模型，直接在血管模型表面预测AAA生长，保留解剖结构和几何保真度。基于24名患者的113次CTA扫描数据训练模型。

Conclusion: 局部定向AAA生长预测可行，可为个性化监测策略提供支持。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown
excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream
tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it
suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different
dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood.
Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are
detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in
this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip
convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba
to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling
can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced
cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive
evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the
proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior
parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at

### [60] [RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772)
*Jiayi Song,Kaiyu Li,Xiangyong Cao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）的半监督语义分割框架RS-MTDF，通过多教师蒸馏与融合方法，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割依赖大量标注数据，但标注成本高昂。半监督学习（SSS）虽能缓解数据依赖，但现有方法因标注与未标注数据分布不匹配而泛化能力不足。

Method: 利用预训练的VFMs（如DINOv2和CLIP）作为教师模型，通过特征级蒸馏将学生模型特征与教师模型对齐，并将知识融合到学生解码器中。

Result: 在ISPRS Potsdam、LoveDA和DeepGlobe数据集上，RS-MTDF表现优异，尤其在LoveDA上不同标注比例下均优于现有方法，并在多数语义类别中取得最高IoU。

Conclusion: 多教师VFM指导显著提升了遥感分割的泛化能力和语义理解，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various
applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,
high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and
time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a
promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS
methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited
labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.
We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and
diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can
effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for
SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and
Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge
embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.
Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and
CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student
features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative
power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.
Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS
Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing
approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in
the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of
multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and
semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

*Keyi Liu,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Gaussian2Scene，一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的自监督学习框架，用于点云预训练，解决了现有方法依赖隐式场景表示和高内存需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在场景级别依赖RGB-D图像作为重建信号，但受限于隐式表示和高内存需求，且难以捕捉3D几何结构。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用双分支掩码自编码器学习2D和3D场景表示；第二阶段通过高斯基元几何位置和渲染RGB图像监督学习。

Result: 在多个下游3D目标检测任务中表现优于现有预训练方法。

Conclusion: Gaussian2Scene通过3DGS显式表示和两阶段训练，显著提升了点云预训练的效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a
cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from
large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often
incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D
images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This
strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model
to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches
are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory
demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in
2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL
framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the
computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct
3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the
backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training
strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D
and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with
reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric
locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process
reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection
tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench为Landsat影像提供了有效的基准测试工具，并证明了SSL4EO-L预训练模型在下游任务中的优越性。

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth
imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress
towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L
dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract
better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and
BigEarthNet-L.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法仅适用于完全对齐的数据集，而真实工业环境中的数据往往未对齐，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 通过深度单应性估计对齐输入前景，利用自单应性学习微调模型以学习正常样本的形状信息，最后基于测试样本特征与正常特征分布的距离进行异常检测。

Result: 通过将HomographyAD应用于多种现有方法，实验表明其性能显著提升。

Conclusion: HomographyAD为工业环境中的异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了数据未对齐的问题。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data,
which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing
facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for
industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances.
However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good
performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial
environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep
anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which
is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first
suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method.
In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn
additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly
detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from
the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed
method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement
through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法在单图像去雾任务中表现出色，具有高效性和泛化性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for
single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with
nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[
-\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \]
where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving
diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and
$\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map
$t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$
using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration
scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results
demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be
generalized to the deep model paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统rectified flow在多样性和多尺度噪声建模上的局限性。

Method: 提出Discretized-RF，将直线路径离散化为可变速度子路径，并在速度上引入噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成多样且高效的轨迹，并产生高质量和多样化的结果。

Conclusion: Discretized-RF在提升多样性和噪声建模能力方面表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art
among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in
straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a
series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line
connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,
and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,
which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling
space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow
only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two
distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present
Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow
models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random
velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path
into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')
to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution
$p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly
superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the
sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and
multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several
representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by
sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse
and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

Conclusion: HunyuanVideo-HOMA通过创新的框架和适配器设计，显著提升了人-物交互视频生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation
-- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to
novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce
HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework.
HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise
inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and
motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer
(MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally
consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we
integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT
weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a
facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in
interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally,
HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and
interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率正弦图修复对CT重建至关重要，但现有扩散模型在高分辨率输入时内存和计算需求过高。

Method: HiSin采用分辨率引导的渐进推理，先在低分辨率提取全局结构，再在高分辨率处理小区域，结合频率感知跳过和结构自适应步长分配。

Result: 实验显示HiSin降低峰值内存31.25%，推理时间18.15%，且保持修复精度。

Conclusion: HiSin为高分辨率正弦图修复提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography
reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible
artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task
due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their
application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and
computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel
diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via
resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global
structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small
patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates
frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce
redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory
usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains
inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Motivation: 随着T2I模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，其能否准确反映多样文化背景成为关注焦点。

Method: 研究引入CulturalFrames基准，涵盖10个国家、5个社会文化领域，通过983个提示、3637张图像和10k+人工标注，系统评估T2I模型的文化表现。

Result: T2I模型在显性期望（68%）和隐性期望（49%）上的失败率均较高，且现有评估指标与人类判断相关性差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I模型在文化表现上的重大缺陷，为开发更具文化敏感性的模型和评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining
superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It
employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the
internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of
interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and
often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals.
Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer
vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image
analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences
between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome
these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language
foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for
vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text
refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two
tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our
method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation
models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing
state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models. The source code of

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based

demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%

Result: StreamSplat在重建质量和动态场景建模上优于现有方法，支持任意长度视频流的在线重建。

Conclusion: StreamSplat是首个完全前馈的框架，能够高效处理未校准视频流并生成动态3D表示。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

Result: 在MSRVTT数据集上，DiscoVLA以50.5%的R@1得分超越之前方法1.5%。

Conclusion: DiscoVLA通过多维度差异减少，显著提升了视频-文本检索性能。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP
for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused
on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands
comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge
in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and
alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting
language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in
Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all
three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to
integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both
vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image
captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment
discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which
leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In
particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous
methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家乘积（PoE）框架，通过异构模型在推理时进行知识组合，无需训练，使用退火重要性采样（AIS）从专家乘积分布中采样，在图像和视频合成任务中表现出更好的可控性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经模型在共享数据域（如图像和视频）上具有丰富的先验知识和互补性，但如何整合来自不同来源（如视觉生成模型、视觉语言模型、图形引擎和物理模拟器等）的多样化知识仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了一个专家乘积（PoE）框架，通过退火重要性采样（AIS）从异构模型的乘积分布中进行采样，实现推理时的知识组合。

Result: 在图像和视频合成任务中，该框架表现出比单一方法更好的可控性，并提供了灵活的视觉生成目标指定接口。

Conclusion: 该训练免费的方法为异构知识整合提供了实用且灵活的解决方案，适用于视觉生成任务。

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

TL;DR: WetCat是首个专为自动化技能评估设计的湿实验室白内障手术视频数据集，旨在解决传统手动评估的低效和主观性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统湿实验室手术培训依赖人工评估，效率低且主观性强，计算机视觉技术为自动化评估提供了可能。

Method: WetCat包含高分辨率视频，涵盖关键手术阶段的注释和语义分割，支持基于标准化框架的技能评估。

Result: WetCat为开发可解释的AI评估工具奠定了基础，提升了手术教育的客观性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: WetCat推动了眼科手术培训的自动化评估，为相关工作流程分析和技能评估设立了新标准。

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab
environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in
ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual
performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often
subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising
avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and
objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic
surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or
isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in
controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat,
the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for
automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of
surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive
phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.
These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment
during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to
standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these
essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven
evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a
strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets
a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in
ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in
Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.

Motivation: 现有AI模型在眼科图像分析中依赖大量标注且泛化能力不足，基础模型虽有望解决这些问题，但缺乏验证且局限于单一模态。

Method: 提出MIRAGE多模态基础模型，并设计新的评估基准，涵盖OCT/SLO分类和分割任务。

Result: MIRAGE在分类和分割任务中表现优于通用和专业基础模型及分割方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE适合作为开发稳健眼科AI系统的基础，模型和评估基准已开源。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting
clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and
existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation
models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown
promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for
ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and
focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel
multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO
classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and
specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in
both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the
development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE
and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种双曲双特征增强方法，用于开放环境，增强已知和未知类别的特征，并通过神经ODE模块和正则化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双曲特征增强方法局限于封闭环境，无法处理未知类别，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 1. 使用神经ODE模块估计特征分布；2. 引入正则化保持层次结构；3. 推导损失上界以支持无限增强。

Result: 在五种开放环境任务中显著提升双曲算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效增强了双曲模型在开放环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing
an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms
with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to
closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen
classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we
propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment,
which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic
space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for
efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation
module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both
seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the
latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also
derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to
train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:
class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,
zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in
open-environment.

TL;DR: 论文提出SkipVAR框架，通过动态跳过冗余步骤和替换无条件分支来加速视觉自回归模型推理，实验显示显著提升效率且保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现视觉自回归模型推理过程中高频步骤存在冗余，但尚未深入分析其计算冗余性。

Method: 提出自动跳过冗余步骤的策略和无条件分支替换技术，并基于样本频率信息动态选择加速策略。

Result: SkipVAR在保持模型质量的同时，实现了最高1.81倍的整体加速和2.62倍的GenEval基准速度提升。

Conclusion: 频率感知的无训练自适应加速方法对可扩展的自回归图像生成有效。

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that
high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute
disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational
redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and
identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional
branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic
step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to
improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the
information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a
technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.
Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies
significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,
a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically
select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate
the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark
datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments
show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall
acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model
quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and
has been publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的方法，通过学习的二进制注意力掩码确保只有关注的图像区域影响预测，解决了背景干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 背景可能强烈影响物体感知，导致偏差表示，尤其是在物体出现在分布外背景时。同时，许多图像级任务需要识别相关区域，通常需要上下文。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段处理完整图像以发现物体部分和任务相关区域；第二阶段利用输入注意力掩码限制其感受野到这些区域，过滤潜在虚假信息。两阶段联合训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提高了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过注意力掩码和两阶段框架有效解决了背景干扰问题，提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Result: 在三个基准测试中均观察到性能提升，特别是在MMMU-PRO上整体提升2%，其中文科领域提升9%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将推理视为搜索过程可以有效激发非推理模型的隐藏知识，生成更长的推理链。

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k
graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance
rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently
guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional
evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their
performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future
advancements. Our project is available at https://omni-bench.github.io/.

Motivation: 在信息爆炸时代，如何高效利用大规模未标记数据并减少对高质量标注的依赖是医学图像分析的关键挑战。半监督学习（SSL）通过知识转移提升性能，成为重要研究方向。

Method: 基于SAM-2的特征提取能力，提出SSS方法，结合DFE机制探索多视图特征差异，并通过PCSW提示生成器为未标记数据生成输入提示。

Result: 在ACDC和BHSD数据集上，SSS平均Dice分数达53.15，比之前最优方法提升+3.65。

Conclusion: SSS通过结合SAM-2和半监督学习，显著提升了医学图像分割性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level
annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by
facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of
fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction
in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models
(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised
SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction
capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus
effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image
segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong"
consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative
Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature
discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across
multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across
multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the
features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a
prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a
Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,
fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,
SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at

<details>

Motivation: 解决跨光谱人体识别中的挑战，特别是如何利用预训练ViT模型处理可见光和红外图像的匹配问题，并探索遮挡对性能的影响。

Method: 通过引入Side Information Embedding (SIE) 编码相机信息，优化ViT模型，并在IJB-MDF数据集上分析遮挡的影响。

Result: 仅编码相机信息即可在LLCM数据集上实现最先进的性能，同时发现遮挡对可见光-红外识别任务的影响尚未充分研究。

Conclusion: SIE在跨光谱识别中表现优异，但遮挡问题仍需进一步研究，尤其是在实际应用中。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a
wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this
work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the
challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching
images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT
architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond
traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side
Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and
camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our
results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly
incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in
visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in
visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because
existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly
feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the
impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain
Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared
images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral
evaluations.

Motivation: 隐蔽目标分割因不完全标注数据和目标与背景的相似性而极具挑战性，现有方法难以有效解决这些问题。

Method: 提出SEE框架，利用SAM生成伪标签，并通过伪标签生成、存储和监督策略优化训练；设计混合粒度特征分组模块以提升分割一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SEE在多个ISCOS任务中达到最优性能，并可作为即插即用方案提升现有模型。

Conclusion: SEE通过统一方法有效解决了ISCOS的两大挑战，具有广泛适用性和高性能。

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

Result: ORIDa成为首个公开的大规模复杂数据集，为对象合成研究提供了重要资源。

Conclusion: ORIDa的多样性和规模使其成为推动对象合成研究的有力工具。

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of
diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the
rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and
scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce
ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale,
real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique
objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa
has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The
factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in
different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background)
image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The
factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific
context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the
first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world
image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of
ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

Motivation: 解决传统目标检测模型依赖预定义类别、无法识别开放世界中新对象的问题。

Result: 在COCO和PASCAL数据集上，ADAM仅凭视觉和上下文信号成功标注新类别，无需微调或重新训练。

Conclusion: ADAM为开放世界对象标注提供了一种高效且无需训练的新方法。

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting
their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome
this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model,
a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown
objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene.
These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an
Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category
supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually
similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and
cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance
consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository
labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority
re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate
that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and
contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在恶劣天气下的性能，且推理开销极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为真实场景中的LiDAR分割提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia
experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due
to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time
deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather
conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world
environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that
affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather.
To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework
that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing
models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view
networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance
intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS)
module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a
Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance
distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The
processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation
pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse
weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective
solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALTA是一种高效的医学视觉-语言对齐方法，通过适应预训练的视觉模型，显著提升了检索和零样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模方法在视觉表示上表现优异但难以直接匹配跨模态。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（来自掩码记录建模），结合时间多视图放射图像输入，提升视觉-语言对齐效果。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅高效，还提升了视觉和语言的理解能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成模型中概念替换技术（CRTs）的局限性，特别是在图像到图像（I2I）场景中的失效问题，并提出了一种新方法AntiMirror以同时实现有效性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在避免生成不可接受内容（如冒犯性或受版权保护内容）方面存在挑战，现有CRTs在I2I场景中表现不佳，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 通过I2I模型实证分析现有CRTs的局限性，提出AntiMirror技术，利用目标图像编辑方法实现概念替换的有效性和保真度。

Result: 现有CRTs在I2I场景中无法有效移除不可接受概念，AntiMirror技术展示了在保持输入内容保真度的同时替换概念的可行性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了CRTs在T2I与I2I场景中的性能差异，提出了AntiMirror作为更优解决方案，强调了保真度在概念替换中的重要性。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models,
have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid
generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted
content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept
replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to
"erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have
started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt
as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are
known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model
to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact
erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in
emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted
concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy
between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing
unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs
to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected
fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of
targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.
We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

TL;DR: SDTagNet是一种在线高精地图构建方法，利用标准定义（SD）地图（如OpenStreetMap）提升远距离检测精度，结合语义信息和NLP特征，显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精地图维护成本高，现有在线构建方法受限于传感器感知范围短，SD地图作为先验信息可解决这一问题。

Method: SDTagNet引入语义文本注释和NLP特征，并采用点级SD地图编码器与正交元素标识符统一整合地图元素。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuScenes数据集上，性能提升高达5.9 mAP（45%）和3.2 mAP（20%）。

Conclusion: SDTagNet通过充分利用SD地图信息，显著提升了在线高精地图构建的精度和效率。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information
to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but
their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.
This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which
generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are
inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To
overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches
have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are
significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map
construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD
maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach
introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we
incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but
additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this
way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the
dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,
we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element
identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on
Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up
to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP
(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中MIL模型在弱监督小数据集上的表现不佳，而迁移学习的潜力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了11个预训练MIL模型在21个任务上的表现，涵盖形态学和分子亚型预测。

Result: 预训练的MIL模型在不同器官和目标任务上表现优异，泛化能力强，且所需预训练数据较少。

Conclusion: MIL模型具有强大的适应能力，迁移学习可显著提升计算病理学任务性能，并提供了标准化资源和预训练模型。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational
pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings
from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly
supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and
conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address
data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of
pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for
morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that
pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target
task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,
pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs
and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less
pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL
models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost
performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the
implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on
popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

*Felix Wagner,Pramit Saha,Harry Anthony,J. Alison Noble,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN)的框架，用于在无法共享训练数据的情况下进行OOD检测，保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗影像等安全关键领域部署ML模型时，需要检测训练数据中未见的输入（OOD），但现有方法要么丢弃训练数据，要么假设测试数据与训练数据集中存储，这在现实中难以实现。

Method: 提出Isolation Network框架，通过解决二元分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度；进一步提出DIsoN，通过交换模型参数而非数据实现分散式OOD检测。

Result: 在四个医疗影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，即在不共享数据的情况下，远程安全地利用训练数据进行OOD检测。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dispersive Loss的简单插件式正则化方法，用于改进基于扩散的生成模型，无需额外数据或预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展独立发展。本文旨在通过Dispersive Loss弥合生成模型与表示学习之间的差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，鼓励隐藏空间中的内部表示分散，类似于对比自监督学习，但无需正样本对。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上验证，Dispersive Loss在多种模型中均表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss是一种简单有效的正则化方法，有望促进生成模型与表示学习的结合。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth
collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We
collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular

scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by
the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new
metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across
scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE),
allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ASVR方法，通过自回归语义视觉重建联合学习视觉和文本模态，解决了当前大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）忽视视觉细节的问题，并在多模态理解任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs仅对文本序列进行自回归监督，未充分利用视觉模态，导致无法处理无标注图像、遗漏关键视觉细节及难以表达视觉中心内容。

Method: 提出ASVR方法，在统一自回归框架中联合学习视觉和文本模态，通过自回归重建图像的语义表示而非原始外观。

Result: ASVR在多种数据规模和LLM骨干上表现优异，将LLaVA-1.5在14个多模态基准上的平均分数提升5%。

Conclusion: 自回归语义视觉重建能有效提升多模态理解，尤其在处理离散语义标记时表现稳定且一致。

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI
systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is
especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role
in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline
that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such
as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is
Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation
model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity,
multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We
showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale
the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and
challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data
helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization
in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving
policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights
through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型加速技术依赖统一启发式方法或时间嵌入变体，需要大量校准且易因提示特定过拟合导致输出不一致。

Method: 发现不同模型和提示中残差输出幅度比单调递减的规律，提出MagCache，利用误差建模机制和自适应缓存策略跳过不重要时间步。

Result: MagCache在Open-Sora和Wan 2.1上分别实现2.1倍和2.68倍加速，视觉质量优于现有方法，在LPIPS、SSIM和PSNR指标上表现突出。

Conclusion: MagCache是一种高效且鲁棒的视频扩散模型加速方法，仅需单一样本校准，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on
uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse
cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with
curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific
overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a
unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.
Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases
monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several
steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache)
that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism
and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of
curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for
calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x
speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior
visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM,
and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前记忆系统在结构灵活性、时间感知和从原始数据合成高级见解方面存在局限性，需要一种更先进的记忆架构来支持大型语言模型（LLM）代理的持续学习和动态适应。

Method: 引入Cognitive Weave框架，利用语义丰富的洞察粒子（IPs）和多层时空共振图（STRG），通过语义预言接口（SOI）动态丰富IPs，并通过认知精炼过程合成高级知识结构（IAs）。

Result: 实验结果显示，Cognitive Weave在任务完成率上平均提升34%，查询延迟降低42%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cognitive Weave为LLM记忆系统提供了创新解决方案，同时探讨了伦理问题和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在通用推理和问题解决上表现出色，但在需要严格遵循SOPs的复杂工业自动化任务中表现不佳，且缺乏相关公开基准测试。

Method: 1. 提出合成数据生成框架以创建工业级SOPs；2. 开发SOP-Bench基准测试，包含10个工业领域的1800多个任务；3. 评估两种LLM代理架构（Function-Calling和ReAct Agents）。

Result: 两种代理的平均成功率仅为27%和48%，且工具注册表过大时错误率接近100%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理能力与工业SOPs需求差距显著，需针对特定领域优化架构和基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

Motivation: 解决在ASP中处理细粒度时间约束时可能导致的规模扩展问题，避免时间精度对性能的影响。

Method: 利用ASP的扩展（如差异约束）来外部处理时间相关约束，从而解耦时间粒度与ASP的性能。

Result: 实现了不受时间精度影响的解决方案，显著提高了处理定量时间约束的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ASP在处理时间约束时的性能瓶颈，为复杂时间相关问题的求解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and
deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with
fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's
grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with
difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle
time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP
from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by
time precision.

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

Motivation: 开发一个能够与学生自然交互、验证证明并提供指导的智能辅导系统，以提升数学学习效率。

Method: 系统由三个模块组成：自动形式化/证明检查器、下一步生成器和自然语言反馈生成器，分别负责验证证明、生成正确下一步和提供提示。

Result: 在PeanoBench数据集上，自动形式化模块正确形式化了57%的正确证明步骤，并在30%的错误证明中准确识别错误步骤；反馈生成器在准确性和相关性上优于基线。

Conclusion: LeanTutor展示了基于大语言模型的数学辅导系统的潜力，尤其在形式化验证和自然语言反馈生成方面表现良好。

Abstract: We present LeanTutor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring system for
math proofs. LeanTutor interacts with the student in natural language, formally
verifies student-written math proofs in Lean, generates correct next steps, and
provides the appropriate instructional guidance. LeanTutor is composed of three
modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and
(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路设计流程涉及大量参数配置，微小变化可能对设计性能产生重大影响。利用LLM在高维优化任务中的学习和推理能力，提出ORFS-agent以提高效率和设计指标。

Method: ORFS-agent通过自适应探索参数配置，结合自然语言目标进行多目标优化，无需额外微调即可与前沿LLM兼容。

Result: 在两个技术节点和多个电路基准测试中，ORFS-agent将布线长度和有效时钟周期改善了13%以上，同时减少40%的优化迭代次数。

Conclusion: ORFS-agent提供了一种灵活、可解释且模块化的多目标优化框架，适用于集成电路设计流程。

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

TL;DR: FloorplanMAE是一个自监督学习框架，用于从不完整的平面图中预测完整的平面图，提升设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建筑设计过程中，平面图设计是动态迭代的，预测完整平面图能帮助建筑师快速生成初步设计，减少重复修改的工作量。

Method: 提出基于Masked Autoencoders (MAE)的方法，通过掩码部分平面图并训练轻量级Vision Transformer (ViT)来重建缺失部分。

Result: 实验表明FloorplanMAE能从不完整平面图中生成高质量的完整平面图，优于现有基准。

Conclusion: FloorplanMAE为平面图生成提供了可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）能够根据问题难度自动分配推理强度（推理标记数量），其机制与模型激活中的预分配方向向量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs自动分配推理强度的现象及其内部机制，以更好地理解模型行为。

Method: 通过线性探针分析模型激活，发现推理强度由预分配方向向量的幅度控制，并通过实验验证其影响。

Result: 发现推理强度可通过方向向量预测和调控，且该向量影响推理标记数量和性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs推理行为的内部机制，并提供了控制推理行为的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在高风险或模糊场景中安全响应的问题。

Result: 实验表明，SafeCoT显著减少过度拒绝并提升泛化能力，即使训练数据有限。

Conclusion: SafeCoT为视觉语言模型的安全对齐提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

Motivation: 现有的图推荐系统容易受到攻击，传统攻击方法隐蔽性低且破坏性强，因此需要一种更隐蔽且影响小的攻击方法。

Method: 设计了一个单节点触发器生成器，通过插入一个虚假用户节点，并引入目标节点与无关节点之间的约束条件。

Result: 实验显示，目标物品对99%目标用户的曝光率不低于50%，对推荐系统性能的影响控制在约5%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了攻击的隐蔽性和目标物品的曝光率，同时对推荐系统的破坏性较小。

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Result: 在概念重要性映射任务中，F1分数达0.97，远超人工基准0.68。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效扩展分类法对齐，保持高质量映射，并在模糊案例中保留专家监督。

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Result: 实验结果表明，SHIELD在16种VRP变体的9个真实地图上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHIELD通过稀疏性和层次性设计显著提升了模型在未见任务和分布上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

Motivation: 工业过程需要鲁棒性和适应性，但传统AI控制系统依赖监督学习，难以泛化到多变和数据稀缺的环境。

Result: CIPHER在分布外任务中表现出强泛化能力，能解释决策并生成精确指令。

Conclusion: CIPHER为工业环境中的自主系统提供了精确、透明和可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗健康领域的应用潜力巨大，但存在幻觉、偏见、透明度和伦理问题，亟需一种负责任的方法来构建和管理AI驱动的数字孪生系统。

Method: 提出RHealthTwin框架，核心是Responsible Prompt Engine（RPE），通过动态提取预定义槽位来结构化输入，生成上下文感知、个性化、公平、可靠且可解释的响应。框架通过反馈循环不断优化提示结构。

Result: 在四个健康领域（心理支持、症状分诊、营养规划和活动指导）中，RPE在基准数据集上取得BLEU=0.41、ROUGE-L=0.63和BERTScore=0.89的先进结果，伦理合规性和指令遵循指标超过90%。

Conclusion: RHealthTwin为医疗健康领域负责任的大型语言模型应用提供了前瞻性基础，解决了现有问题并表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Motivation: 低空经济的快速发展推动了无人机的广泛应用，但现有研究常忽略城市空域约束和经济效率等关键因素，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 结合深度强化学习（DRL）和大语言模型（LLM）推理，设计了一种新型无人机轨迹规划框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据采集率、避障、成功着陆、合规性和能源效率等方面显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低空经济网络约束下的无人机轨迹规划关键挑战。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

TL;DR: HGformer框架通过图Transformer和分层决策模型解决两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏中的资源分配问题，显著提升了效率和对抗收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以在复杂网络拓扑和阶段依赖的两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏中实现全局最优策略。

Method: 提出HGformer框架，结合增强的图Transformer编码器和分层决策模型，并设计分层反馈强化学习算法。

Result: 实验显示HGformer在资源分配效率和对抗收益上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGformer在复杂动态游戏场景中表现卓越，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Petri网展开的新技术FoldA，用于计算部分顺序对齐，解决了现有方法在并发行为表示和状态空间爆炸方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一致性检查方法在处理高并发和选择性的过程模型时，容易导致状态空间爆炸，且无法充分表示并发行为。

Method: 使用定向Petri网展开技术动态计算部分顺序对齐。

Result: 实验表明，FoldA虽然计算时间较长，但减少了排队状态数量，并更准确地表示了并发行为。

Conclusion: FoldA为并发过程的一致性检查提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Result: 在未见动态、运动学和拓扑的机器人上，四种环境中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 模块化循环架构能有效推断上下文信息，提升对未见机器人形态的泛化性能。

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Conclusion: CoVo为无监督推理学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法在多种数据集上表现出优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法避免了二值化过程，显著提升了条件独立性检验的性能。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate
that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于观察数据的因果发现方法存在局限性，而现有基于LLM的方法结果不稳定，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 通过知识图谱中的元路径子图识别，结合学习排序模型优化子图选择，并将其融入零样本提示中，提升LLM的因果推理能力。

Result: 在生物医学和开放领域数据集上，该方法在F1分数上比基线方法高出44.4分。

Conclusion: 结合KGs与LLMs的方法显著提升了因果发现的稳定性和准确性，为复杂系统中的因果推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Conclusion: 未来研究应更全面地评估LLMs在数据科学中的作用，包括探索性活动、人机协作和任务转换的可能性。

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Motivation: 探索LLM辅助写作对认知和行为的潜在影响，评估其在教育中的长期效果。

Method: 将参与者分为LLM、搜索引擎和纯大脑三组，通过EEG和NLP分析认知负荷和写作表现，并在第四阶段交换条件。

Result: LLM使用者脑连接最弱，认知活动减少，写作归属感最低；纯大脑组表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM虽便利，但可能带来认知代价，需进一步研究AI在教育中的角色。

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted
essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,
and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same
condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group
(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition
(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18
completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive
load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

Result: 在四个经典MOCOP基准测试中，POCCO表现出显著优势和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: POCCO通过自适应模型选择和偏好优化，有效提升了多目标组合优化问题的解决效果。

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的交通模拟器难以真实模拟驾驶行为，而交通交叉口在安全和效率方面至关重要，因此需要一种数据驱动的模拟器来更准确地模拟交叉口行为。

Method: 研究提出了一种多头部自注意力轨迹预测模型，结合信号信息，并通过模拟闭环管道评估其在交通工程相关指标上的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为数据驱动的交通模拟提供了新方法，并通过实际模拟验证了其有效性，为交通工程应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory
reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break
traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors
and present our results.

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present

TL;DR: AbstentionBench是一个大规模基准测试，用于全面评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对不确定性问题时的拒绝回答能力，发现当前模型在此方面表现不佳，且推理微调反而会降低其拒绝回答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保LLMs在现实世界中的可靠部署，尤其是在面对不确定、模糊或无法回答的问题时，模型需要具备拒绝回答的能力。目前这一领域缺乏系统性的评估框架。

Method: 研究团队开发了AbstentionBench，一个包含20个多样化数据集的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在面对未知答案、模糊问题、错误前提等情况时的拒绝回答能力。

Result: 评估20个前沿LLMs后发现，拒绝回答能力仍是一个未解决的问题，模型规模的扩大对此帮助有限。推理微调反而平均降低了24%的拒绝回答能力。精心设计的系统提示虽能提升表现，但无法从根本上解决模型对不确定性的推理不足。

Conclusion: AbstentionBench的发布旨在推动LLM可靠性的研究，当前模型在拒绝回答能力上仍有显著不足，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALE-Bench是一个用于评估AI系统在基于分数的算法编程竞赛中表现的新基准，专注于计算困难的优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI系统在算法工程中的表现，尤其是在复杂优化问题领域（如物流、调度、生产规划和电网平衡）的能力。

Method: 引入ALE-Bench基准，基于AtCoder Heuristic Contests的真实任务，支持长时间迭代解决方案的优化问题。

Result: 前沿LLMs在特定问题上表现优异，但在跨问题一致性和长期问题解决能力上与人类仍有差距。

Conclusion: ALE-Bench有助于推动未来AI在算法工程领域的进步。

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory
production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new
benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

### [133] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在关系抽取任务中表现出保守偏差，倾向于选择No_Relation标签，导致信息丢失。研究发现保守偏差比幻觉更常见，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化了这种效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在关系抽取任务中的保守偏差行为及其对信息丢失的影响，以理解模型在不确定时的决策模式。

Method: 通过多种提示、数据集和关系类型系统评估保守偏差，引入Hobson's choice概念，并使用SBERT和LLM提示量化语义相似性。

Result: 保守偏差的发生频率是幻觉的两倍，且保守行为在约束提示和半约束/开放式提示生成的标签中表现出语义相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs的保守偏差虽避免错误分配，但导致信息丢失，需在模型设计中平衡保守性与信息保留。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

TL;DR: QA-LIGN是一种自动符号奖励分解方法，通过为每个宪法原则设计特定评估问题，提高语言模型对齐的透明度和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准奖励对齐方法将多样反馈压缩为单一标量奖励，导致目标不透明且难以解释。

Method: QA-LIGN分解奖励机制，为每个原则设计独立评估问题，生成多个奖励组件。

Result: 实验表明，QA-LIGN在透明度和适应性上优于传统方法，性能与DPO基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: QA-LIGN为语言模型对齐提供了更可解释和可控的方法，且不影响任务性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对权威数据源和多模态经济推理的重视，EconWebArena填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过大语言模型生成候选任务，并经过人工筛选，确保任务的清晰性、可行性和数据可靠性。

Result: 评估显示多模态大语言模型在导航、多模态理解和数据提取方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: EconWebArena为经济领域的网络智能提供了一个严格的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于注意力层和Transformer模型的多语言仇恨言论检测方法，针对英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语构建了一个平衡的三语数据集，并在多个先进模型上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全和包容性，而乌尔都语的仇恨言论检测研究较少，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 使用注意力层增强Transformer模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和Qwen 2.5 72B）和传统机器学习模型（如SVM），构建了一个三语数据集并通过关键词过滤和人工标注确保质量。

Result: 模型在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语上的宏F1分数分别为0.87、0.85和0.81，多语言联合模型达到0.88，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了有效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE提出了一种高效、任务驱动的持续知识图谱嵌入方法，通过可学习令牌简化知识转移，显著提升训练效率和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续知识图谱嵌入方法在效率和扩展性上存在不足，主要由于手动设计的节点/关系重要性评分和计算成本高的图遍历。

Method: ETT-CKGE引入任务驱动的可学习令牌，直接捕获任务相关信号，避免显式节点评分或遍历，通过简单矩阵操作实现知识转移。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，ETT-CKGE表现出优越或竞争性的预测性能，同时显著提升训练效率和扩展性。

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE通过任务驱动令牌和高效矩阵操作，解决了现有方法的效率与扩展性问题，为持续知识图谱嵌入提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 尽管AI能生成叙事一致的短篇小说，但其文学价值（尤其是美学质量）缺乏严格评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出GrAImes评估协议，基于文学理论设计客观框架，并通过专家和爱好者验证其有效性。

Result: 验证结果显示GrAImes协议能有效评估AI生成微小说的文学价值。

Conclusion: GrAImes协议为AI生成微小说的文学评估提供了基础，未来可用于更广泛的自动生成文本评估。

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

TL;DR: LLM-BT利用大语言模型实现跨语言术语标准化，通过回译验证术语一致性，支持多路径验证，并将回译视为动态语义嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速发展的技术领域（如AI和量子计算）中，传统人工标准化方法难以满足多语言一致性需求。

Method: 提出LLM-BT框架，结合回译和多路径验证流程（检索-生成-验证-优化），实现术语标准化。

Result: 实验显示术语一致性超过90%，跨语言鲁棒性强（BLEU>0.45，葡萄牙语准确率100%）。

Conclusion: LLM-BT将回译转化为多语言术语标准化的主动引擎，支持人机协作，为全球科技领域术语治理提供基础设施。

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在信息检索中存在干扰问题，导致准确性下降，提示需要改进模型抑制无关内容的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在长上下文中的信息检索能力，特别是干扰效应对检索准确性的影响。

Method: 采用认知科学中的主动干扰范式（PI），设计PI-LLM评估方法，测试LLMs在语义相关更新流中的检索表现。

Result: LLMs的检索准确性随干扰累积呈对数线性下降，提示指令缓解干扰效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs存在工作记忆瓶颈，需增强模型抑制无关内容的能力以提高检索灵活性。

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用写作过程数据（如键盘记录和定期快照）改进大型语言模型（LLM）对学生写作反馈的效果，发现学生更偏好基于过程的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反馈仅基于最终文本，缺乏写作过程的上下文，无法反映学生的思考和修改过程。

Method: 开发了一个数字写作工具，记录学生的打字内容和文章演变过程，并比较了基于最终文本和完整写作轨迹的LLM反馈效果。

Result: 学生更偏好基于过程的反馈，且某些编辑行为（如添加内容或重组段落）与更高的评分相关。

Conclusion: 让LLM更了解写作过程可以生成更有意义、个性化和支持性的反馈。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers

Method: 通过CLAIM-BENCH基准测试，比较六种LLMs在三种不同方法（如分治法）下的表现，评估其在300多个主张-证据对中的表现。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4和Claude）在精确度和召回率上优于开源模型；三遍和逐一提示方法显著提升了LLMs的表现，但增加了计算成本。

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH为评估LLMs的科学理解能力设定了新标准，并为未来开发更可靠的系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

Motivation: 提升阅读理解教学中诊断性问题的有效性，帮助教师更有针对性地指导学生的推理能力。

Method: 提出推理类型分类法，分析题目分布，使用GPT-4o通过少量示例生成推理题目，比较有无链式思考提示的效果。

Result: GPT-4o生成的问题93.8%质量良好，但仅42.6%准确匹配目标推理类型，人工与自动结合效果显著。

Conclusion: 自动生成与人工判断结合是提升诊断性阅读理解评估质量与可扩展性的有效途径。

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented
dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard
Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of
approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the

TL;DR: NoWait通过禁用显式自我反思标记（如“Wait”和“Hmm”），显著减少了推理过程中的冗余输出，提高了效率，同时保持了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中常因过度思考产生冗余输出，影响效率。本研究探讨显式自我反思标记是否必要。

Method: 提出NoWait方法，在推理过程中禁用显式自我反思标记，减少冗余输出。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，NoWait将推理轨迹长度减少27%-51%，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: NoWait为高效且保持性能的多模态推理提供了一种即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于布鲁姆分类学的多认知层次评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在医学领域的表现，发现模型性能随认知复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同认知层次上的医学能力表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 整合现有医学数据集，设计针对三个认知层次的任务（基础知识掌握、综合知识应用、场景问题解决），并评估六类主流LLMs。

Result: 模型性能随认知复杂度增加而下降，模型规模在高认知层次中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs在高认知层次医学能力的必要性，为开发适合实际医学应用的LLMs提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

*Yiqun Sun,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张文本嵌入研究应超越表层语义，关注隐含语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型过于关注表层语义，忽视了语言中的隐含意义（如语用、说话者意图和社会文化背景），导致其在需要深层语义理解的任务中表现不佳。

Method: 通过初步研究展示现有模型在隐含语义任务上的局限性，并提出研究方向的转变。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的模型在隐含语义任务上表现仅略优于简单基线。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区采用更多样化和语言学基础的数据，设计评估深层语义理解的基准，并将隐含语义作为核心建模目标。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果归因的框架，用于识别Transformer中与行为相关的注意力头，通过VQ-AE量化行为相关与无关子空间，提升了推理时干预的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖表面线索或启发式规则，导致模块选择不理想或结果偏离目标。

Method: 训练VQ-AE量化注意力头的激活，划分行为相关与无关子空间，通过二元分类评估行为相关性。

Result: 在七个LLM和五个行为数据集上验证，方法在真实性干预任务中表现优异，且所选头具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为行为相关模块选择提供了原则性方法，显著提升了推理时干预的效果。

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: CC-RAG通过结合零样本三元组提取和主题感知图链，改进RAG管道，以建模因果关系，提升LLM在专业领域的因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG管道将证据视为扁平上下文，缺乏建模真实因果依赖的结构，导致LLM在专业领域的因果推理表现不佳。

Method: CC-RAG通过构建<原因、关系、结果>三元组的有向无环图（DAG），并利用前向/后向链进行结构化多跳推理。

Result: 在比特币价格波动和高雪氏病两个领域的实验中，CC-RAG在链相似性、信息密度和词汇多样性上优于标准RAG和零样本LLM。

Conclusion: 显式建模因果结构使LLM能生成更准确且可解释的响应，尤其在扁平检索失败的专业领域。

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD)方法，通过对比长距离和局部注意力机制，缓解了LLMs在长文本中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文窗口中存在性能下降问题，现有解决方案训练成本高，且统计行为和成本效益方法研究不足。

Method: 从解码角度识别了Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA)现象，提出PCD方法，通过对比长距离和局部注意力机制的logits，使模型关注大规模短到长训练带来的增益。

Result: 实验表明，PCD有效缓解了注意力分数衰减，并在长上下文基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PCD是一种无需训练的高效方法，显著提升了LLMs在长文本中的表现。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

Motivation: 由于Transformer的二次计算和线性内存复杂度，优化长上下文LLM的推理变得重要。现有方法依赖粗略预测，准确性不足。

Method: 提出基于草稿模型的框架，通过SpecKV优化KV缓存丢弃，SpecPC识别并丢弃不重要提示词。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长上下文基准测试中准确性更高，同时保持内存、延迟和吞吐量的改进。

Conclusion: 草稿模型首次用于近似LLM推理加速，扩展了其应用范围，效果优于现有基线。

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于单任务环境，无法反映真实世界的复杂性，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 设计了EIFBENCH基准，包含多任务场景和多种约束条件，并提出SegPO算法优化模型表现。

Result: 评估显示现有大语言模型在复杂指令下表现差异显著，需进一步优化。

Conclusion: EIFBENCH和SegPO为复杂场景下的模型评估和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Motivation: 现有LLMs评估主要集中于英语和高资源语言，缺乏对低资源语言的标准化评估。

Method: 引入mSTEB基准，覆盖语言识别、文本分类、问答和翻译任务，评估了包括Gemini 2.0 Flash、GPT-4o (Audio)等模型。

Result: 评估显示高资源与低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲语言）表现差距显著。

Conclusion: 需要更多投资以解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Conclusion: TACTIC通过结合认知理论和多智能体协作，有效释放了大语言模型的翻译潜力，实现了高质量的翻译效果。

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs的认知错误检测能力，但缺乏对其元认知能力（如步骤错误的自我意识）的深入分析，这对LLMs的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出AutoMeco框架评估现有元认知指标，并提出无需训练的MIRA策略优化这些指标。

Result: 在三个数学推理数据集和三个LLMs上的实验表明，AutoMeco与Best-of-N验证相比更合理，MIRA能更好地评估LLMs的元认知能力。

Conclusion: AutoMeco和MIRA为LLMs的元认知能力评估和提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

Motivation: 训练LLM成本高昂，且容易偏向主流文化和价值观。领域适应虽有助于模型与多样化文化背景对齐，但计算成本仍是障碍，尤其是对资源有限的研究团队。

Method: 评估不同数值精度和数据并行化策略对训练速度和模型准确性的影响。

Result: 研究结果为关注能源效率、可访问性或硬件限制的场景提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 通过优化数值精度和并行化策略，可以在低资源环境下实现更高效的领域适应。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM结构化剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源重新训练，成本高昂。

Method: 利用PCA处理多头注意力层的矩阵乘积，快速分解降低复杂度；通过SVD线性校准解决FFN层剪枝误差累积问题。

Result: Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Olica提供了一种无需重新训练的高效LLM剪枝方案。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前有害模因检测方法在资源效率、灵活性和可解释性上存在不足，限制了实际部署。

Method: 开发高保真模因转文本管道，结合人类指导的零样本CoT提示，利用小型LLMs进行分类。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上验证了框架的有效性，支持低资源、可解释的有害模因检测。

Conclusion: U-CoT+框架为有害模因检测提供了高效、灵活且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are

### [162] [Efficient Context Selection for Long-Context QA: No Tuning, No Iteration, Just Adaptive-$k$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08479)
*Chihiro Taguchi,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive-$k$ retrieval dynamically selects context size for QA, outperforming fixed methods with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of determining optimal external context size in retrieval-augmented generation for QA tasks.

Method: Uses similarity scores between query and passages to adaptively select the number of passages, without requiring model fine-tuning or extra LLM inferences.

Result: Matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines, uses fewer tokens, and retrieves 70% of relevant passages.

Conclusion: Dynamic context adjustment improves QA efficiency and accuracy across various models.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

TL;DR: 论文分析了现有文本到图像生成评估框架的不足，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注与人类判断的一致性，忽略了评估框架的其他关键特性。

Method: 识别了两个关键评估特性，并通过实验验证了当前主流框架的不足。

Result: 当前评估框架未能完全满足这些特性。

Conclusion: 提出了改进图像-文本对齐评估的建议。

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次大规模审计了参数规模在0.5至50亿之间的指令调优小型语言模型（SLMs），揭示了能力与公平性之间的关系、不同架构的偏见差异以及量化压缩的微妙权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中的快速部署，其伦理风险尚未被充分理解，因此需要对其进行系统性评估。

Method: 使用BBQ基准在零样本提示下评估了来自Qwen 2.5、LLaMA 3.2、Gemma 3和Phi家族的九个开源模型，分析其在模糊和明确上下文中的效用和公平性。

Result: 1. 能力与公平性可以共存（如Phi模型F1分数超90%且偏见最小）；2. 不同架构的偏见表现差异显著（Qwen 2.5可能表现虚假中立，LLaMA 3.2则表现出刻板偏见）；3. 量化压缩带来复杂权衡（如4-bit AWQ量化提升LLaMA 3.2-3B的F1分数但增加Phi-4-Mini的残疾相关偏见7个百分点）。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中公平高效的SLM部署提供了实用指导，特别有助于小型企业和资源受限环境。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究LLMs的文化敏感性，尤其是对地区礼仪的理解和偏见，目前缺乏相关资源。

Method: 构建EtiCor++语料库，设计评估任务和偏见测量指标。

Result: 实验显示LLMs对某些地区存在固有偏见。

Conclusion: EtiCor++为评估和改进LLMs的礼仪敏感性提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注无监督数据聚类而忽略域适应，限制了广义意图发现的实用性。

Method: 提出原型提示框架和分层一致性约束，整合外部旧知识和目标域新知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

Result: LLMs在解决冲突时表现不佳，但显式推理能显著提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 未来研究仍需改进LLMs在冲突解决中的表现。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

Result: 系统提升了与多种LLM模型的兼容性，并改善了用户参与度。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的持续增强，狼人杀游戏中将不再需要额外组件。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards
the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显式推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）存在标记开销大和固定推理轨迹的问题，而潜在推理方法缺乏有效的后训练更新机制。

Method: 提出两种策略：1) 对比推理反馈，通过比较强/弱基线优化嵌入方向；2) 残差嵌入细化，结合历史梯度稳定更新。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中验证有效性，MathQA上准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: 框架显著提升推理性能，无需额外训练即可实现高效优化。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中容易导致学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题。

Method: POCL框架包含难度测量器和训练调度器，分阶段从易到难引入样本，并使用逐步升温的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种白盒KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在KD过程中结构化训练数据对提升蒸馏模型稳定性和性能的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Result: 嵌入距离与传统分类方法高度一致，能捕捉全局和局部语言模式，但可视化语言关系仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言研究提供了新途径，未来可扩展至未充分研究的语言及整合社会语言学变异。

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

Conclusion: CounselBench为高风险的LLMs心理健康应用提供了临床基准框架，揭示了模型的一致性和特定失败模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

Conclusion: 公开了数据集、代码和模型，为细粒度语义对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated

RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

Method: MEMETRON将LLM解码视为离散黑盒优化问题，使用GENETRON和ANNETRON算法，结合奖励模型和LLM上下文操作搜索响应空间。

Result: 在人类偏好对齐任务中，MEMETRON显著优于标准解码和重排序方法。

Conclusion: MEMETRON展示了在不重训练模型的情况下提升对齐效果的潜力，具有模块化和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

*Mingyu Zheng,Zhifan Feng,Jia Wang,Lanrui Wang,Zheng Lin,Yang Hao,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableDreamer是一个渐进式、弱点引导的数据合成框架，用于解决LLM在表格指令调优中数据多样性和效率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM数据合成方法在表格理解任务中无法充分探索输入空间且忽视目标LLM的弱点，导致数据多样性和效率不足。

Method: 通过合成多样化表格和指令作为种子数据，迭代探索输入空间并基于新发现的弱点数据生成最终训练数据。

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer将Llama3.1-8B-instruct的平均准确率提升11.62%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer显著提升了表格指令调优的数据效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

TL;DR: 生成式关系提取方法在肠道微生物组研究中表现潜力，但BERT方法仍更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低资源生物医学领域（肠道微生物组）中的关系提取问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行上下文总结，再通过指令调优生成关系。

Result: 总结能提升生成式RE性能，但BERT方法仍表现更好。

Conclusion: 生成式方法在低资源专业领域有潜力，但需进一步优化。

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RuleReasoner的强化规则推理方法，通过动态采样和领域增强，显著提升了小推理模型（SRMs）在多样任务和领域中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中规则格式、类型和复杂性的多样性对规则推理提出了挑战，而现有的大型推理模型（LRMs）虽然表现优异，但小型推理模型（SRMs）的泛化能力仍待验证。

Method: RuleReasoner通过动态采样方法，基于历史奖励更新不同领域的采样权重，实现领域增强和灵活的在线学习，无需人工设计的混合训练方案。

Result: 在分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）任务上，RuleReasoner显著优于前沿大型推理模型（如OpenAI-o1），且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner证明了小型推理模型在规则推理任务中的有效性，同时提供了高效的动态采样方法。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中的能源消耗问题，提出通过输出压缩和提示工程策略减少响应长度，实现25-60%的能源优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理过程消耗大量能源，而输出压缩领域的研究较少，因此探索如何通过减少响应长度优化能源效率。

Method: 对12种解码器LLM在5个数据集上进行基准测试，分析响应长度和信息冗余问题，并提出提示工程策略以减少响应长度。

Result: 通过针对长度减少和信息内容控制的提示策略，实现了25-60%的能源优化，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 简单的提示工程策略可以有效减少LLM响应长度，显著降低能源消耗，为能源高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClimateViz是首个大规模科学图表事实核查基准，包含49,862个与2,896个可视化图表关联的声明，评估了多模态语言模型在图表推理上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学事实核查主要关注文本和表格，忽视了科学图表在定量证据和统计推理中的重要性。

Method: 引入ClimateViz数据集，评估多模态语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，并分析结构化知识图谱解释的作用。

Result: 当前模型在图表推理上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅76.2-77.8%，远低于人类水平（89.3-92.7%）。解释增强输出对部分模型有提升。

Conclusion: 科学图表事实核查具有挑战性，需进一步改进模型能力。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfPO是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）的偏好学习方法，通过优化偏好关键令牌，无需额外模型或计算资源，显著提升对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接对齐算法（如DPO）对所有令牌进行均匀调整，忽略其对偏好的影响，导致效率低下或过优化问题。ConfPO旨在通过聚焦关键令牌，更高效地利用KL散度预算。

Method: ConfPO仅基于训练策略的置信度识别和优化偏好关键令牌，无需辅助模型或额外计算。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，ConfPO表现优于均匀调整的直接对齐算法，且无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ConfPO是一种简单、轻量且无需模型的偏好学习方法，显著提升对齐效果，适用于各种LLM。

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

Motivation: 当前复杂系统合规检测面临法律与技术文本复杂、模型解释需求高、保证案例数据有限等挑战。

Method: 将保证案例的声明-论据-证据结构建模为多跳推理任务，利用大型语言模型生成保证案例，并引入覆盖率和结构一致性指标。

Result: 通过GDPR要求的多跳推理任务验证了生成保证案例的有效性。

Conclusion: NLI方法在自动化合规检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多教师知识蒸馏的多语言语音情感识别方法，显著提升了英语、芬兰语和法语的情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单语言语音情感识别已取得进展，但构建多语言系统仍具挑战性，目标是训练一个统一的多语言模型。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec2.0作为单语言教师模型的基础，通过语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法，将知识蒸馏到单一多语言学生模型中。

Result: 学生模型在英语数据集上加权召回率达72.9，芬兰语数据集上未加权召回率达63.4，优于微调和知识蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升悲伤和中性情绪的识别上表现优异，但在愤怒和快乐情绪的识别上仍有挑战。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Result: 改进的代理方法优于现有技术（程序思维），且更安全。

Conclusion: 代理间的交互对性能有显著影响，改进方法在无标注数据时表现更优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Motivation: 探讨AI研究如何整合伦理与社会价值，以及跨学科合作是否在实践中推动这一趋势。

Method: 开发分类器识别论文中的社会内容，量化社会导向研究的比例及团队构成。

Result: 计算机科学团队在AI社会导向研究中的占比增加，涉及公平、安全、医疗等多个领域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了跨学科团队主导社会导向AI的假设，提出技术团队主导可能对AI安全与治理的影响，以及人文社科在AI未来中的独特角色问题。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Motivation: 开发一种符合严格网络安全和数据保密标准的内部大语言模型解决方案，专注于核能领域。

Method: 基于Transformer架构，使用公开的Essential CANDU教材作为数据集，在单GPU上训练。

Result: 模型能够捕获专业核词汇，但生成文本的句法连贯性有待提高。

Conclusion: 未来需扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调，以提升模型在核能领域的准确性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away
in unstructured text data. This data, however, is not readily usable for
advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured

the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear
industry and how synthetic data provides a solution by transforming existing
text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text,
extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality
of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the

performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses
primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于函数调用的大型语言模型（LLM）替代传统自然语言转SQL（NL-to-SQL）的方法，以提高核电站数据查询的准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL-to-SQL方法在核电站等关键系统中存在查询验证困难和数据库结构复杂的问题，导致准确性和信任度降低。

Method: 通过预定义一组经过审核的专用函数，封装已验证的SQL逻辑，避免直接生成SQL查询，从而降低风险。NL-to-SQL工具辅助生成函数代码，专家专注于验证而非创建。

Result: 研究表明，基于函数的方法在准确性和可维护性上优于直接NL-to-SQL生成。

Conclusion: 该框架平衡了用户易用性与操作安全性，为关键系统提供了稳健的数据检索方案。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,
and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection

*Francisco Vargas,Alejandro González Coene,Gaston Escalante,Exequiel Lobón,Manuel Pulido*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，从法律文档中提取交通事故信息，包括残疾百分比和赔偿金额。通过文本分割和实体提取，比较了传统方法和基于语义搜索的方法，后者结合LLM显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从法律文档中提取交通事故信息对量化保险公司成本至关重要，但由于文档中的复杂论证，即使是专家也难以完成。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 文本分割（正则表达式或语义搜索）；2) 使用LLM（如LLaMA-2、LLaMA-3、GPT-4 Turbo）进行实体提取，部分模型经过LoRA微调。

Result: 基于语义搜索和LLM的方法显著优于传统方法（39.5%）。LLaMA-2 70B微调后达79.4%，LLaMA-3 8B基础版达76.6%，GPT-4 Turbo最高（86.1%）。

Conclusion: 结合语义搜索和LLM的方法有效提升了信息提取的准确性，尤其是微调后的LLaMA-2 70B和LLaMA-3 8B表现突出，GPT-4 Turbo表现最佳。

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

*Flavio D'Intino,Hans-Peter Hutter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SRB-300数据集，用于提升瑞士德语（低资源语言）的语音识别性能，通过微调Whisper模型显著降低了词错误率（WER）并提高了BLEU分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞士德语缺乏标准化书写形式且方言多样，现有数据集在自然对话语音中表现不佳，需要更真实的数据集来改进语音识别。

Method: 构建SRB-300数据集（300小时真实广播和电视录音），并微调多个OpenAI Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后模型显著提升性能，WER降低19%-33%，BLEU分数提高8%-40%，最佳模型WER为17.1%，BLEU为74.8%。

Conclusion: SRB-300数据集和微调方法有效提升了瑞士德语语音识别的鲁棒性，为其他低资源语言提供了借鉴。

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLM对齐中的几何盲点，提出了ALKALI对抗基准和GRACE对齐框架，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM防御无法快速适应日益增长的对抗威胁，尤其是表面防御无法识别潜在几何伪装。

Method: 引入ALKALI对抗基准和GRACE框架，通过潜在空间正则化和几何约束提升对齐效果。

Result: GRACE框架将攻击成功率降低39%，并提出了量化潜在对齐失败的AVQI指标。

Conclusion: GRACE和AVQI为LLM安全提供了新的几何视角和实用工具。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

Method: 基于DeBERTa架构，结合规则增强的语言后处理和本体实体归一化，使用专家标注的植物胁迫响应文献进行微调。

Result: PlantBert在实体类型上表现出强大的泛化能力，展示了在低资源科学领域进行稳健领域适应的可行性。

Conclusion: PlantBert为农业NLP提供了可扩展且可复现的框架，推动了植物科学领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

Motivation: 旨在解决法律文本的复杂性和规范性，通过自动化方法提高法律信息学的可扩展性。

Method: 采用结构化流程，将复杂的规范性语言分解为原子片段，提取道义规则，并评估其语法和语义一致性。评估了多种LLM配置，包括提示工程策略、微调模型和多阶段流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，机器生成的形式化表示与专家手工制作的表示具有良好的一致性，特别是通过有效提示的LLMs表现突出。

Conclusion: LLMs在有效提示下能够显著提升法律信息学的可扩展性，为自动化法律分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs
- particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to
scalable legal informatics.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（包括高资源语言的方言）在自然语言理解系统中的困难，通过方言标准化提升下游任务性能。

Method: 结合基于规则的语言学转换和大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本提示，无需平行数据。

Result: 在希腊方言数据集上验证了方法的有效性，发现之前的研究仅依赖表层语言信息，而新方法能保留更多语义。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为方言标准化提供了有效途径，同时揭示了语义信息的重要性。

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

TL;DR: PropMEND是一种基于超网络的方法，用于改进大型语言模型中的知识传播能力，通过元学习修改梯度以支持多跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术无法支持基于注入知识的推理，限制了模型的应用范围。

Method: 提出PropMEND，扩展MEND的元目标，通过超网络学习梯度修改，促进知识在多跳问题中的传播。

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现显著提升，多跳问题准确率提高近2倍；在未见实体-关系对上也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现优异，但在未见关系上的性能仍有提升空间，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Result: 模型在数学推理基准测试中表现优于或媲美规模更大的模型，挑战了高性能数学推理需要庞大基础设施的范式。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高性能数学推理模型可以在资源受限的环境中训练，降低了AI研究的门槛。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end
hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming
GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating
reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing
access to high-performance AI research.

Method: 提出FaithfulRAG框架，在事实层面识别知识冲突，设计自思考过程，让模型推理并整合冲突事实后再生成响应。

Result: 实验表明FaithfulRAG优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaithfulRAG有效解决了知识冲突问题，提升了生成结果的忠实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在政治领域中如何管理共同基础，尤其是在存在错误信息和高风险的情况下，以评估其在纠正用户错误信念方面的表现。

Method: 通过分析LLMs回答直接知识问题和诱导问题的能力，评估其是否能够主动纠正用户的错误信念，并结合其知识水平和政治偏见进行分析。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在建立共同基础和拒绝用户错误信念方面存在显著挑战，对其在政治话语中缓解错误信息的作用提出了担忧。

Conclusion: LLMs在政治领域的共同基础管理和错误信息纠正方面表现不足，需进一步改进以应对相关挑战。

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

Result: 新方法在多个开源语言模型中实现了近乎完美的数值解码精度，证明模型能精确表示数字。此外，嵌入的精确性与算术错误相关，调整嵌入可减少错误。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能精确表示数字，嵌入的精确性与算术错误相关，调整嵌入可改善算术性能。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Conclusion: AGENT-NEXUS有效提升了移动代理在组合任务上的性能，为实际应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

Motivation: 早期检测对预防和延缓老年人群常见的神经认知障碍（NCD）进展至关重要，语言相关fMRI可能是一种有前景的检测手段。

Method: 研究设计了一种自然语言相关的fMRI任务，结合机器学习和人口统计学特征（年龄、性别、教育年限），对参与者认知状态进行分类。

Conclusion: 自然语言相关的fMRI任务在早期检测老年认知衰退和NCD方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally
ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and
urban settings.

*Lei Zhang,Jiaxi Yang,Min Yang,Jian Yang,Mouxiang Chen,Jiajun Zhang,Zeyu Cui,Binyuan Hui,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SWE-Flow是一个基于测试驱动开发（TDD）的数据合成框架，通过单元测试自动推断增量开发步骤，并生成可验证的TDD任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件工程数据依赖人工提交的问题，而SWE-Flow旨在通过单元测试自动生成开发步骤，提高效率。

Method: 构建运行时依赖图（RDG）以捕捉函数交互，生成结构化的开发计划，包括部分代码库、单元测试和代码修改。

Result: 从真实GitHub项目中生成了16,061个训练实例和2,020个测试实例，实验表明微调模型显著提升了TDD编码性能。

Conclusion: SWE-Flow为TDD研究提供了高效的数据合成方法，并公开了所有资源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at
[Github](https://github.com/Hambaobao/SWE-Flow).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入半自动化框架，扩展了第二语言韩语的通用依存标注工作，将XPOS序列与UPOS类别对齐，并扩充了L2韩语语料库。实验表明，对齐数据集提高了标注一致性和分析准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展第二语言韩语的通用依存标注工作，解决XPOS与UPOS之间的对齐问题，并提升标注和分析的准确性。

Method: 引入半自动化框架，识别XPOS序列的形态句法结构并与UPOS对齐；扩充L2韩语语料库；通过两种NLP工具包评估对齐数据集的效果。

Result: 对齐数据集提高了标注一致性，并显著提升了形态句法标注和依存分析的准确性，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: XPOS-UPOS对齐框架能有效提升L2韩语分析的准确性和一致性，尤其在资源有限的情况下具有重要价值。

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those
constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing
L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these
alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned
dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also
enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly
in cases of limited annotated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多样本集合提升LLM性能，尤其在数学领域，传统方法如多数投票或验证器排名存在局限性。

Method: 训练名为SSA的小型LLM，通过强化学习优化其聚合多个样本答案的能力。

Result: SSA在多个推理数据集上表现优于其他方法，且具有跨样本集大小、基础模型和任务的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSA方法高效且通用，可轻松应用于黑盒模型的输出。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类和LLM（ChatGPT-4o、Llama3.1-8b、Deepseek-r1-8b）对第二语言写作的校对效果，发现两者均提升了词汇连贯性，但LLM更倾向于生成性修改。

Motivation: 探讨人类与不同LLM在第二语言写作校对中的效果差异及一致性。

Method: 分析人类和三种LLM对相同第二语言写作的词汇和句法干预。

Result: 人类和LLM均提升词汇连贯性，LLM修改更生成性，且三种LLM结果高度一致。

Conclusion: LLM校对在词汇和句法修改上表现一致且生成性强，可能优于人类校对。

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

TL;DR: Router-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态路由和聚合多个LLM的能力，优化复杂任务的性能与成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器通常采用单轮、一对一映射方式，无法充分利用多个LLM的互补优势，限制了处理复杂任务的能力。

Method: Router-R1将多LLM路由和聚合建模为序列决策过程，利用LLM的推理能力交替执行“思考”和“路由”动作，并通过轻量级规则奖励指导学习。

Result: 在七个通用和多跳QA基准测试中，Router-R1优于多个基线，表现出卓越的性能、泛化能力和成本管理。

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习实现了多LLM的动态路由与聚合，为性能与成本权衡优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在文本任务上表现优于视觉任务，通过分析任务特定计算子图（circuits）发现模态间差异主要在数据处理位置。通过将视觉数据表征从后期层修补到早期层，性能差距缩小了三分之一。


<details>

Motivation: 探究视觉-语言模型在视觉和文本任务上表现差异的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 比较不同模态的任务特定计算子图，分析数据处理位置差异，并提出将后期层视觉表征修补到早期层的干预方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均缩小了模态间性能差距的三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态性能差距的原因，并提出了一种无需训练的改进方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

*Siddharth Siddharth,Brainerd Prince,Amol Harsh,Shreyas Ramachandran*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 为大一工科生设计的跨学科AI课程，涵盖技术与社会影响，提升学生对AI的理解与意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工科生缺乏AI基础知识及其社会影响认知的问题。

Method: 设计三个模块（行星、社会影响、职场），由工程与人文学科教师联合授课。

Result: 学生AI挑战认知提升，包括环境意识与公平解决方案。

Conclusion: 课程通过跨学科设计与教学，成功提升学生对AI的综合理解。

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our
lives.

Method: 使用学生行为、学术和人口统计数据，采用多层感知机分类器（MLPC）等标准机器学习模型，并结合特征选择方法和可解释机器学习技术。

Result: MLPC在测试集上最高准确率为86.46%，10折交叉验证下测试集平均准确率为79.58%，训练集为99.65%。

Conclusion: 神经网络在预测学生学业表现方面表现优异，特征选择和可解释方法对模型性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast
students' academic performance in a school setting. Students' data with
behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with
standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron
classifier (MLPC). MLPC obtained 86.46% maximum accuracy for test set across
all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to
validate the feature selection approach.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine, with generative AI
models like ChatGPT reshaping perceptions of its potential. This study examines
surgeons' awareness, expectations, and involvement with AI in surgery through
comparative surveys conducted in 2021 and 2024. Two cross-sectional surveys
were distributed globally in 2021 and 2024, the first before an IRCAD webinar
and the second during the annual EAES meeting. The surveys assessed
demographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only).
The surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021
and 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in
2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this,
familiarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for
AI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical
concerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing
accountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the
primary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and
structured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption.
Optimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of
respondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to
integrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are
evolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data
science. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and
infrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical
frameworks, and infrastructure development is essential.

Abstract: This research-to-practice work-in-progress (WIP) paper presents an AI-enabled
smart tutor designed to provide homework assessment and feedback for students
in an undergraduate circuit analysis course. We detail the tutor's design
philosophy and core components, including open-ended question answering and
homework feedback generation. The prompts are carefully crafted to optimize
responses across different problems. The smart tutor was deployed on the
Microsoft Azure platform and is currently in use in an undergraduate circuit
analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a
large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United
States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor
collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the
course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student
feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor.
Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit
analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify
frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time
awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom
instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete
dataset is available after the Spring 2025 semester. We also explore the
potential applications of this smart tutor across a broader range of
engineering disciplines by developing improved prompts, diagram-recognition
methods, and database management strategies, which remain ongoing areas of
research.

TL;DR: TelePiT是一种新型深度学习架构，通过整合多尺度物理和遥相关意识，显著提升了全球次季节至季节（S2S）预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法未能明确建模S2S时间尺度上关键的物理过程和遥相关，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: TelePiT包含三个关键组件：球谐嵌入、多尺度物理信息神经ODE和遥相关感知Transformer。

Result: TelePiT在实验中显著优于现有数据驱动方法和数值天气预报系统，如2米温度RMSE降低57.7%。

Conclusion: TelePiT通过整合物理过程和遥相关，为S2S预测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据流中的变化点检测（CPD）面临数据模式复杂性和假设违反的挑战，现有深度神经网络检测器性能有限，而集成方法虽能提升鲁棒性，但标准聚合技术（如平均）未能充分利用问题特性。

Method: 提出WWAggr方法，基于Wasserstein距离进行任务特定的集成聚合，适用于多种深度CPD模型的集成。

Result: WWAggr方法在多种集成模型中表现优异，并有效解决了决策阈值选择的难题。

Conclusion: WWAggr为高维CPD提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Result: 理论证明KP-PINNs具有稳定性，数值实验验证其高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: KP-PINNs为科学计算中基于PINNs的求解器提供了稳定性和准确性的改进方向。

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规则方法在SQL查询重写中存在局限性，如难以发现新规则、不适用于新查询模式等。人类专家能力更强但扩展性差，LLM具备接近人类的语义和推理能力，因此尝试利用LLM改进查询重写。

Method: 设计了基于有限状态机（FSM）的多智能体框架，结合外部工具和实时数据库反馈；开发了重写中间件提升LLM生成优化查询的能力；采用提示注入技术改进执行计划。

Result: QUITE将查询执行时间减少35.8%，重写数量增加24.1%，覆盖了更多查询模式。

Conclusion: QUITE通过LLM和反馈机制，显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能和覆盖范围，优于现有规则方法。

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

Motivation: 语言模型在自主数据分析中的应用日益广泛，但其对数据异常（如缺失值、离群值等）的识别和处理能力尚未充分研究。这些异常在真实表格数据中常见，若处理不当会严重影响分析结论的有效性。

Method: 通过程序化扰动模拟数据异常，开发了RADAR基准测试，包含2980个表格查询对，覆盖9个领域和5种数据异常类型，并系统性地评估模型在不同表格大小下的表现。

Result: 前沿模型在无数据异常时表现尚可，但在引入数据异常后性能显著下降，暴露了其在数据感知分析能力上的关键缺陷。

Conclusion: RADAR作为一个灵活可扩展的基准测试，为提升表格数据推理能力提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

### [223] [GradEscape: A Gradient-Based Evader Against AI-Generated Text Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08188)
*Wenlong Meng,Shuguo Fan,Chengkun Wei,Min Chen,Yuwei Li,Yuanchao Zhang,Zhikun Zhang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GradEscape是一种基于梯度的攻击方法，针对AI生成文本检测器，通过加权嵌入和参数更新实现高攻击成功率，同时适应不同语言模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本离散性导致的不可微分问题，并应对检测器与攻击者之间的分词器不匹配问题。

Method: 引入加权嵌入构造方法，结合分词器推断和模型提取技术，实现高效攻击。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型上优于现有攻击方法，成功应用于商业检测器。

Conclusion: 揭示了训练数据中文本表达风格的差异是主要漏洞，并提出了防御策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在网络安全访问控制系统中应用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成密码策略的准确性和一致性，发现当前LLMs存在显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现优异，但其输出的不一致性和不可预测性在安全关键领域（如访问控制）带来挑战，尤其是密码策略生成的可靠性。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）仅通过自然语言提示生成配置；2）结合官方文档作为基准生成配置，评估其准确性、一致性和合理性。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前LLMs在生成密码策略时存在显著问题，需进一步优化。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在访问控制系统中的部署提供了改进方向，强调了优化其可靠性的必要性。

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

TL;DR: ReAgent是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理后门攻击的新型防御方法，通过检测用户指令、代理规划和执行间的不一致性来识别后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在训练和微调过程中面临后门攻击的安全风险，可能导致恶意操作。

Method: ReAgent采用两级检测方法：执行层面验证代理思维与行动的一致性，规划层面通过代理重建指令检查一致性。

Result: ReAgent显著降低了攻击成功率（如数据库操作任务中降低90%），优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用被攻击代理自身能力可有效缓解后门风险。

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

*Tingzhi Li,Xuefeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WGLE提出了一种新的GNN黑盒水印方法，通过LDDE嵌入多比特字符串作为所有权信息，避免了后门风险，并在实验中表现出高验证准确性和低性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN所有权验证方法（如指纹和黑盒水印）存在计算成本高、后门风险或无法传递额外信息的问题。

Method: WGLE利用LDDE（层间距离差异）量化节点特征与预测距离的差异，通过预定义边上的LDDE值嵌入水印。

Result: 在六个数据集和六种GNN架构上，WGLE实现了100%的验证准确率，平均性能损失仅0.85%，且对抗攻击鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: WGLE是一种高效、安全且低开销的GNN所有权验证方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.
The code is available in the repository.

Result: 在六个基准测试中，MasHost表现优于现有基线方法，验证了其有效性、效率和结构合理性。

Conclusion: MasHost是首个基于强化学习的自主多智能体系统图构建框架，为复杂任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Motivation: 现有设计方法依赖可微分评估、固定拓扑和离散空间，而实际设计需要非可微分评估、可变拓扑和连续空间。

Method: DCIDA通过联合训练的采样策略生成设计决策，并利用注入式映射将原始设计动作转换为物理表示。

Result: 实验表明，DCIDA的Transformer策略网络显著降低了设计误差，尤其在复杂传递函数情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: DCIDA为分布式电路逆设计提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex
high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to
suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity}
issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed,
which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming
communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI
embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop
{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory
planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of
using \textit{CALL}.

Conclusion: Re4MPC为复杂机器人运动规划提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

problem show that in a variety of scenarios, the diffusion model can generate
realistic failure samples while capturing a wide variety of potential failures.
Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities
in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend
physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains
severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive
benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning
through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level
cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering
(VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning
and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial
relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging
vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive
technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning
paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven
significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in
their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic
environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations
and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with
deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging
differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for
uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to
new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models,
robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel
situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid
neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of
autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and
accelerate their development.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Kelvinlet增强学习是一种高效策略，适用于手术中的实时物理感知模拟。

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue
modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations
of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate
surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue
grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented
learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft
tissue simulation in surgical applications.

Motivation: 目的是扩展altiro3D库的功能，使其能够处理3D视频流，并简化用户操作，提升3D体验。

Method: 使用MiDaS CNN从单张2D图像提取深度图，结合AI技术优化性能，并实现多平台GUI以简化屏幕区域选择。

Conclusion: 扩展版altiro3D库显著提升了3D内容生成的效率和用户体验，适用于多种设备和应用场景。

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to
get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here
introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or
flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize
light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core
function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a
single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied
to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,
altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a
Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,
etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be
selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such
as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a
Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has
been also implemented. Sources available at:

Motivation: 铰接物体在日常生活中普遍存在，但现有方法需要精心采集的数据，限制了其实际应用。论文旨在从手持设备拍摄的RGBD视频中实现铰接物体的重建。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，该方法显著优于现有方法，能够跨类别重建铰接物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为铰接物体的实际应用提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their
kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in
embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured
data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and
generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction
of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a
hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an
articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this
setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and
there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers
joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD
video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$
larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11
categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video
as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real
articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos,
outperforming existing methods significantly.

Method: 使用复值高斯基元重新定义3D高斯泼溅，直接优化RGBD多视图图像。

Result: 相比现有方法，速度提升30x-10,000x，图像质量相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何对齐的物理真实全息场景表示迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in
3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering,
particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a
novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on
intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with
complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light
waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes
complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This
eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed
improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step
towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene
representations.

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster

rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for

selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level
material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over
800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

Abstract: Music is a powerful medium for influencing listeners' emotional states, and
this capacity has driven a surge of research interest in AI-based affective
music generation in recent years. Many existing systems, however, are a black

flexible and adaptive to users. We present \textit{AffectMachine-Pop}, an
expert system capable of generating retro-pop music according to arousal and
valence values, which can either be pre-determined or based on a listener's
real-time emotion states. To validate the efficacy of the system, we conducted
a listening study demonstrating that AffectMachine-Pop is capable of generating
affective music at target levels of arousal and valence. The system is tailored
for use either as a tool for generating interactive affective music based on
user input, or for incorporation into biofeedback or neurofeedback systems to
assist users with emotion self-regulation.

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called
MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based
evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and
actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral

Motivation: 人工生命研究旨在创建能自发产生生命特性的系统，如自生、自我复制和进化。Lenia等连续细胞自动机（CA）已显示出生成类生命模式的潜力，但需要进一步扩展以支持更复杂的动态。

Method: 提出Flow-Lenia，一种质量守恒的Lenia扩展模型，通过优化更新规则参数生成复杂行为模式，并将模型参数嵌入其动态中以实现多物种模拟。

Result: 实验表明Flow-Lenia能有效生成复杂行为的SLPs，并支持进化动态研究。

Conclusion: Flow-Lenia为人工生命研究提供了新工具，支持复杂行为模式生成和进化动态分析。

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

Motivation: 日本金融数据稀缺，阻碍了大语言模型在金融分析领域的应用和发展。

Method: 通过EDINET下载过去10年的年报，自动标注任务标签，构建EDINET-Bench数据集。

Result: 即使最先进的大语言模型在欺诈检测和盈利预测等任务上表现仅略优于逻辑回归。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在金融领域的应用面临挑战，需领域特定优化，EDINET-Bench为未来研究提供资源。

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is
publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging
the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector

(WavLM-large, OLMo). We focus on ablating different aspects of such systems
including full/LoRA adapter fine-tuning, the effect of agent turns in the
dialogue history, as well as fuzzy matching-based output post-processing, which
greatly improves performance of our systems on named entities in the dialogue
slot values. We conduct our experiments on the SpokenWOZ dataset, and
additionally utilize the Speech-Aware MultiWOZ dataset to augment our training

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Conclusion: LLMs具备深度符号推理能力，支持神经网络学习与形式化方法的更紧密集成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of
coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more
complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper
investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in
programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Repeton是一个开源框架，利用LLMs进行精确的代码操作，通过结构化补丁和测试流程提升代码修复的精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在代码生成和理解方面表现强大，但在复杂软件工程任务中精度低且可解释性有限。

Method: 采用结构化补丁和测试流程，迭代诊断问题、提出代码更改并通过自动化测试验证。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite基准测试中，Repeton在补丁有效性和可解释性上优于RAG方法。

Conclusion: 通过模块化和可验证的阶段分解任务，Repeton为可扩展且透明的自主调试提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward
scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的发展，SWE代理在自动化软件任务中表现出强大能力，但其内部决策机制尚不清晰，研究这些机制有助于提升代理的可靠性和效率。

Method: 通过执行轨迹分析，提出了SWE代理决策路径的分类法，并深入研究了三大核心组件（错误定位、补丁生成和测试生成）及其对成功的影响。

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents
(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

Result: 研究发现这些工具生成的代码普遍不符合绿色编码标准，存在默认的非环保行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调了深入调查和制定有效改进策略的必要性，以提升AI生成代码的可持续性。

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排名框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成文档的方法成本高且计算密集，需改进稀疏检索性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM扩展查询的两种检索路径，通过改进的排名融合方法生成结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM扩展方法，结合稀疏检索器达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在提升稀疏检索性能方面表现优越，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在跨文档语义距离较远时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的检索方法。

Method: 提出HLG三层索引结构，结合两种检索器（StatementGraphRAG和TopicGraphRAG）优化检索性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在五个数据集上平均提升23.1%的检索召回率和正确性。

Conclusion: HLG和配套检索器显著提升了RAG的性能，开源工具可供使用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Motivation: 尽管已有大量RDF标准的知识图谱，但其丰富的语义信息在GNN推荐系统中尚未被充分利用。

Method: 提出了一种综合集成RDF知识图谱与GNN的方法，利用其拓扑和内容信息，并评估了不同语义特征初始化和图结构异质性对推荐任务的影响。

Result: 实验表明，利用RDF知识图谱的语义丰富性显著提升了推荐系统性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于GNN的推荐系统在Linked Open Data云中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our
GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态检索中的特征对齐问题，探索不同模态表示之间的几何关系。

Method: 研究了视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，使用了四种标准相似性度量和两种基于神经网络的学习方法。

Result: Wasserstein距离可作为模态差距的度量，余弦相似性在特征对齐任务中表现最佳，传统多层感知机不足以捕捉多模态交互。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态信息检索提供了新见解，尤其适用于现实世界的跨模态应用。

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

Conclusion: AutoML方法在ADMET建模中有效，为数据有限的任务提供了特征选择指导。

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and

awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath

physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

Conclusion: MD-ViSCo提供了一个统一框架，能够处理多种生命体征波形，简化了医疗监测中的模型开发。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully

integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the

end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in
enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,

efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics
from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of
protein structures derived by structural determination methods like
cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of
vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning
3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning.
For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000
protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model
in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In
both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval
performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for
structure-function understanding in protein biology.

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的R-CDT（Radon累积分布变换）方法，用于处理图像分类任务中的非仿射变形和脉冲噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，图像数据常受到非仿射变形和噪声的影响，传统的R-CDT方法无法完全解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了max-normalized和mean-normalized版本的R-CDT，分别基于Wasserstein-infinity和Wasserstein-2距离，以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，新方法在非仿射变形和脉冲噪声下仍能保持分类的可分性。

Conclusion: 改进的R-CDT方法在复杂变形和噪声环境下表现出色，为图像分类任务提供了更鲁棒的特征提取工具。

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute
feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the
small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and
provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from
translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition
of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine
transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this
issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only
requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary
affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the
max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against
non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its
separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance
between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance
only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a
mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the
Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive
noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well
as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful
measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely
studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage
and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing
techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy
to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been
made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,
unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which
does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,
variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small
size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible,
robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection
identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained
to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly
accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural
network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye
images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased
eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking
for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for
physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of
complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning
(DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation
with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit
limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and
unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet
effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time
optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed
sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements
in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and
requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the
versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics
simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at

Motivation: 多头自注意力（MHSA）的二次复杂度在实时和资源受限环境中成为计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出PnP-Nystra，作为MHSA的线性近似替代，适用于SwinIR、Uformer和RVRT等窗口式Transformer架构。

Result: 在图像和视频修复任务中，PnP-Nystra实现了2-4倍（GPU）和2-5倍（CPU）的加速，PSNR最大仅下降1.5 dB。

Conclusion: PnP-Nystra是首个无需训练的线性注意力替代方案，显著提升效率且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern
computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input
length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource
constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear
approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that
can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models
without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables
efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures,
including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and
video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution,
demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU
and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the
method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention
functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains
challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and
significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful,
biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior
studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously
distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular
organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary
branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed"
path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final
prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large
number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and
evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three
experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and
variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our
ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies
90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >
0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer
categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular
stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging
clinical settings.

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying
abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse
datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical
constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle
mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate
full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in
realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and
none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture
fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates
separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)
contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based
model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design
enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840
pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of
classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both
numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image
generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential
to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion
detection.

Method: 结合术中CBCT与术前CT进行多模态学习，生成sCT，并在真实和合成数据集上验证。

Result: 多模态sCT优于单模态基线，尤其在低质量CBCT-CT对齐情况下效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究结果在真实临床数据中具有高度可重复性，证实多模态方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time
intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition
speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant
artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed
Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we
enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative
CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use
a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT
quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT
consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains
observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate
that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理过程中KV缓存的高内存需求限制了其在资源受限平台上的部署，现有量化方法无法动态优化精度分配。

Method: KVmix利用基于梯度的重要性分析，为KV投影矩阵分配层特定的位宽，并动态优化长上下文任务中的精度分配。

Result: 在Llama和Mistral等模型上，KVmix实现了极低量化配置（Key 2.19bit，Value 2.38bit）下的近无损推理性能，内存压缩4.9倍，推理速度提升5.3倍。

Conclusion: KVmix通过动态混合精度量化和长上下文优化，显著提升了LLM在资源受限平台上的部署效率。

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT模型通过双层次传输框架有效解决了部分域适应问题，提升了知识转移的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在预训练中使用低精度表示模型参数的技术，提出了一种改进的舍入模式以解决MXFP8格式中的发散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在减少精度的同时保持模型训练的稳定性，特别是在大规模数据集上。

Method: 提出了一种改进的舍入模式，使用“round-to-infinity”计算缩放因子，以解决MXFP8格式的发散问题。

Result: 改进的舍入模式成功实现了8B模型在15T tokens上的MXFP8预训练。

Conclusion: MXFP8格式需要谨慎使用，改进的舍入模式能有效提升训练稳定性。

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在块缺失数据场景中特征提取效果不佳，静态图结构限制了模型对非平稳交通数据的适应性。

Method: 提出STAMImputer，结合专家混合框架（MoE）和低秩引导采样图注意力机制（LrSGAT），动态生成图结构以捕捉实时空间相关性。

Result: 在四个交通数据集上的实验表明，STAMImputer性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAMImputer通过动态图结构和专家混合框架，有效解决了交通数据填补中的块缺失和非平稳性问题。

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow
prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to
effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly
constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for
the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for
traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence
weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling
Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local
and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are
utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial
correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for
evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance
improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 减少监督微调的计算成本，探索在推理时通过上下文学习等技术实现类似效果。

Result: 对于文本生成和线性分类任务，给出了数据集大小的理论界限，证明了上下文学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型的高效部署提供了理论基础，并通过检索增强生成等技术将理论应用于实际。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

TL;DR: FairDICE是首个离线多目标强化学习框架，直接优化非线性福利目标，无需显式偏好权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中线性标量化无法捕捉非线性公平目标（如Nash社会福利或最大最小公平）的问题。

Method: 利用分布校正估计联合考虑福利最大化和分布正则化，实现稳定且样本高效的学习。

Result: 在多个离线基准测试中，FairDICE表现出优于现有基线的公平感知性能。

Conclusion: FairDICE为离线多目标强化学习中的非线性福利优化提供了一种统一且高效的方法。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中数据增长带来的标注和训练效率问题，避免传统方法的数据冗余和主动学习的复杂性及偏差。

Method: 利用任务特定模型和开源模型，选择性标注并整合在线和网络数据，实现高效数据集优化。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等真实数据集上，减少32%的标注和训练成本且无性能损失，半监督学习下可进一步降至50%。

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution提供了一种高效、无偏差的数据集优化方法，显著降低标注和训练成本。

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种预训练时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）与传统统计和机器学习方法在电力价格预测（EPF）中的表现，发现Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE表现最佳，但仍未超越传统的双季节性MSTL模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力价格预测对电力现货市场交易决策至关重要，但现有生成式人工智能和时间序列基础模型在EPF中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 通过德国、法国、荷兰、奥地利和比利时的2024年日前拍卖电价数据，比较了多种TSFMs与传统方法的预测性能。

Result: Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE表现最佳，但双季节性MSTL模型在一致性和统计性能上更优。

Conclusion: 传统方法（如MSTL）在电力价格预测中仍具有优势，TSFMs尚未超越其性能。

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

Motivation: 传统预测算法（如k-NN）在结合神经网络特征提取时表现优异，但由于其不可微分和独特优化需求，难以直接整合到监督微调（SFT）中。

Method: 引入NONA回归层，利用注意力机制和学习的注意力掩码方案，近似k-NN回归算法。

Result: 在多个非结构化数据集上，NONA在回归任务中表现优于密集层预测和基于SFT嵌入的k-NN。

Conclusion: NONA为将传统算法整合到SFT中提供了可行方案，并展示了性能提升的潜力。

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

Motivation: 联邦学习在非独立同分布数据下性能下降严重，传统方法成本高或适应性差。

Method: UniVarFL采用两种正则化策略：分类器方差正则化和超球均匀正则化，模拟IID训练动态。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，UniVarFL在准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限的实际联邦学习部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

Method: 使用50万小时驾驶数据集，分析模型性能与计算预算的关系，研究模型参数与数据规模的优化缩放比例，以及推理时计算效率。

Conclusion: 优化训练和推理时的缩放特性是提升模型性能的关键；通用驾驶数据训练可缓解机器人数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM提取的RWD提供严格透明评估方法，推动行业标准并支持AI在肿瘤研究中的可信应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Conclusion: 提出的零参数方法简单有效，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一种新型方法，结合超网络持续学习和区间算术，同时解决灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络存在灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击脆弱性问题，目前尚无模型能同时解决这两个问题。

Method: SHIELD通过超网络生成任务嵌入向量，动态为目标模型分配权重，并利用区间算术为输入数据定义范围，生成预测。

Result: SHIELD为目标模型提供了严格的对抗攻击保证，同时保持网络适应性。

Conclusion: SHIELD成功解决了持续学习中的安全性挑战，兼具安全性和适应性。

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Conclusion: HC-RLHF为语言模型对齐提供了一种可靠且高效的方法，解决了安全性和有用性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Result: 实验表明，Bingo在多个推理基准上优于其他方法，实现了准确性与效率的良好平衡。

Conclusion: Bingo展示了通过显式训练提升语言模型高效推理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

Result: 构建了包含5,404个任务的AutoSDT-5K数据集，模型性能显著提升，接近GPT-4o水平。

Conclusion: AutoSDT为数据驱动的科学发现提供了有效的数据支持，推动了AI在科学领域的应用。

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,
building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data
for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present
AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding
capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources,
select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

Method: 提出L-STEP，通过可学习的时空位置编码方案，结合MLP的表示能力，验证其理论性质和实际性能。

Result: L-STEP在13个经典数据集和TGB基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高于现有方法。

Conclusion: L-STEP是一种高效且灵活的时空位置编码方法，适用于动态图数据的预测任务。

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

TL;DR: ECON提出了一种基于贝叶斯纳什均衡的多LLM协调框架，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决多智能体框架中计算成本高和缺乏收敛保证的问题。

Method: 将多LLM协调建模为不完全信息博弈，通过分层强化学习实现分布式推理与集中输出。

Result: ECON在六个基准测试中平均性能提升11.2%，并具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: ECON为构建更强大的多LLM集成提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估LLM的被动推理能力，而主动推理（需要与外部系统交互获取信息）缺乏系统性研究。

Method: AR-Bench包含三类任务（侦探案例、情境谜题和数字猜测），模拟真实场景，测试常识、逻辑和符号推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM在主动推理上表现较差，难以获取或利用必要信息，且现有改进方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升主动推理方法的紧迫性，建议引入交互学习、实时反馈和环境感知目标。AR-Bench已开源。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is
publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

Motivation: 现有方法反馈空间受限且缺乏协调训练，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将多轮优化建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出DPSDP算法，基于自生成数据直接偏好学习训练LLM系统。

Result: 在MATH 500基准测试中，5步优化将准确率从58.2%提升至63.2%。

Conclusion: DPSDP算法在多智能体协作和分布外泛化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

Motivation: 传统强化学习训练推理语言模型依赖于初始探索能力，且模型主要用于蒸馏新学生而非直接部署。因此，需要一种更高效、可重用的方法。

Method: 引入RLTs框架，训练教师模型生成详细解释，并通过密集奖励机制评估学生模型的理解能力。

Result: 7B规模的RLT在竞赛和研究生级别任务中表现优于现有方法，且在训练更大模型或零样本任务中仍保持高效。

Conclusion: RLTs框架提升了强化学习推理的效率与可重用性，为模型蒸馏和冷启动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

Method: 分析不同任务中线性分类器的相似性，并测试稀疏正则化及混合探针方法的效果。

Result: 线性分类器在不同任务中差异显著，稀疏正则化后支持集几乎不重叠，混合方法也无法克服此限制。

Conclusion: LLMs的激活模式分类方法在跨任务场景下存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

Result: 数据增强显著提升了快速增强检测效果，空间坐标作为输入特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为时空数据中极端事件的合成数据生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

Conclusion: HASFL有效解决了异构边缘网络中的性能问题，提升了分片联邦学习的效率。

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOBODY通过跨域表示学习和数据增强，有效解决了动态不匹配问题，提升了策略性能。

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

TL;DR: Reinforced RCSL通过引入“分布内最优未来回报”概念，解决了RCSL缺乏拼接能力的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCSL在离线强化学习中简单稳定，但缺乏拼接能力，性能受限于数据集质量。

Method: 提出Reinforced RCSL框架，引入“分布内最优未来回报”机制，避免复杂回报增强技术。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，Reinforced RCSL优于标准RCSL，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL是一种简单有效的改进方法，解决了RCSL的关键限制。

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统的激活正则化方法存在局限性，AdaAct旨在通过神经元级别的适应性优化训练过程，弥补这一不足。

Method: AdaAct通过动态调整学习率以适应激活方差，结合了Adam的快速收敛和SGD的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdaAct成功填补了Adam和SGD之间的性能差距，是一种高效且泛化能力强的优化算法。

Abstract: We introduce AdaAct, a novel optimization algorithm that adjusts learning
rates according to activation variance. Our method enhances the stability of
neuron outputs by incorporating neuron-wise adaptivity during the training
process, which subsequently leads to better generalization -- a complementary
approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental
results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image
classification benchmarks. We evaluate AdaAct on CIFAR and ImageNet, comparing
it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges
the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization
capabilities of SGD, all while maintaining competitive execution times. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于抽象-精炼技术的高效计算神经网络预测的可证明充分解释的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后验解释方法缺乏形式化保证且计算效率低，需要一种可扩展的方法来提供可证明的解释。

Method: 通过构建一个显著简化的网络抽象原始网络，逐步精炼网络规模直至收敛，以加速验证过程。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了获取可证明充分解释的效率，并提供了网络预测的细粒度解释。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证解释形式化验证的同时显著提升了计算效率，为神经网络解释提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）的隐私保护能力备受争议，现有研究对梯度泄漏攻击（GLAs）的实际威胁存在分歧。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明即使在现实环境中，FL系统仍存在重大隐私漏洞。

Method: 作者重新审视GLAs，发现其性能瓶颈源于梯度匹配问题。为此，提出FedLeak方法，引入部分梯度匹配和梯度正则化技术，并制定基于文献和行业实践的实际评估协议。

Result: 在现实FL环境中，FedLeak仍能实现高保真数据重建，揭示了FL系统的重大漏洞。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了FL系统在现实环境中的隐私风险，强调了开发更有效防御方法的紧迫性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

effectively leveraging knowledge from earlier generations to enhance learning
efficiency and stability in subsequent generations. Experimental results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基准假设边是非空间且简单的，忽略了物理路径的多样性。HSG-12M旨在填补这一空白，提供更真实的几何多图数据。

Method: 通过Poly2Graph管道，将一维晶体哈密顿量的谱数据转换为静态和动态的哈密顿谱图，形成多样化的物理拓扑结构。

Result: HSG-12M包含1160万静态和510万动态图，覆盖1401个特征多项式类，展示了多边几何学习的新挑战。

Conclusion: HSG-12M不仅推动了几何感知图学习，还为多项式、向量和矩阵提供了通用的拓扑指纹，开启了数据驱动科学发现的新机会。

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Method: 通过将时间序列转换为图像，利用预训练的ViTs的2D分块能力，增加标签相关标记并降低样本复杂度。

Result: TiViT在标准时间序列分类基准上实现了最佳性能，并发现中间层的高内在维度对分类最有效。

Conclusion: TiViT展示了视觉表征在非视觉领域的复用潜力，并与TSFM表征空间具有互补性，结合后可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting

TL;DR: 提出了Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM)，一种将物理约束显式嵌入生成模型的新框架，显著提高了物理残差的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法（如扩散模型和流匹配）通常隐式学习物理规律，缺乏显式约束，限制了准确性和应用范围。

Conclusion: PBFM为物理和工程中的代理建模、不确定性量化和加速模拟提供了高效且理论完备的框架。

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

Result: 在Tiny Shakespeare任务中，JoFormer的困惑度更低且收敛更快。

Conclusion: JoFormer为Transformer中位置结构的整合提供了理论支持，展现了其潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: ChannelTokenFormer是一种基于Transformer的预测模型，旨在解决多变量时间序列数据中的通道依赖、采样异步和缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据通常是多变量的，且存在通道依赖、采样异步和缺失值等问题，现有模型常基于简化假设，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出ChannelTokenFormer模型，通过灵活架构显式捕捉跨通道交互，适应通道异步采样，并有效处理缺失值。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上的实验表明，ChannelTokenFormer在复杂现实条件下具有优越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer为解决多变量时间序列预测中的实际问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对变分自编码器图像压缩的额外微调训练步骤，通过重新训练部分网络以优化量化潜在表示，从而提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在训练过程中难以正确建模量化噪声，导致网络性能次优。

Method: 在传统端到端训练后，对部分网络进行微调，使用推理阶段获得的量化潜在表示重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在均匀标量量化和熵约束量化中均能带来额外的编码增益，最高可达2.2%的比特率节省。

Conclusion: 通过正确量化数据的微调训练，可以显著提升图像压缩的性能，且不增加推理复杂度。

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide

search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE

provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

Conclusion: RRP是一种轻量级、通用的探索策略，可无缝集成到现有RL算法中。

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

Conclusion: SeerAttention-R是一种高效、灵活的稀疏注意力框架，适用于长解码任务，具有显著的性能优势。

Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically
tailored for the long decoding of reasoning models. Extended from
SeerAttention, SeerAttention-R retains the design of learning attention
sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query
pooling to accommodate auto-regressive decoding. With a lightweight plug-in
gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing
pretrained model without modifying the original parameters. We demonstrate that
SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning
accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention
block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse
decoding kernel that achieves near-theoretical speedups of up to 9x over
FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPU at 90% sparsity. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于流匹配的概率模型InFOM，用于预测智能体在长期未来访问的状态，并通过潜在变量捕捉用户意图以提高模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练在机器学习中已广泛应用，但在强化学习（RL）中仍面临长期依赖的挑战。本文旨在通过生成式AI的新工具解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

TL;DR: 论文研究了深度强化学习（DRL）中环境状态扰动的对抗攻击与防御，提出了一种名为BAT的防御框架，显著提升了代理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少关注环境状态扰动，而这类扰动在现实场景中很常见，因此需要提升DRL代理的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过监督学习调整代理以避免灾难性失败，随后用强化学习进行对抗训练（BAT框架）。

Result: 实验表明主流代理在环境状态扰动下脆弱，而BAT能显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BAT框架在多种情境下有效增强代理对环境状态扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Motivation: 传统方法（如DPO）在样本配对和数据多样性上效率低下，限制了生成奖励模型的性能。

Method: 引入偏好细化，利用Chain-of-Thought采样提升数据多样性；结合困惑度评分机制和M-DPO，捕捉更细粒度的偏好差异。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了数据效率和模型性能，小数据集训练的模型可媲美大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源RLHF应用提供了高效的数据优化策略。

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Result: TimeFlex在多种时间序列条件下表现优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了时间序列特性与模型性能之间的明确联系，为未来模型设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data
characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models.
Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series
characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated
using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known
characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them.
Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular
architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and
periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models,
offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series
conditions.

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Motivation: 解决非自回归模型在生成变长序列时的局限性，提供更灵活的生成方式。

Method: 基于连续时间马尔可夫链的编辑操作建模，利用辅助变量扩展状态空间以提高训练效率。

Result: 在图像描述生成、文本和代码生成任务中表现优于自回归和掩码模型。

Conclusion: Edit Flows通过编辑操作实现了高效的序列生成，为非自回归模型提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

TL;DR: FZOO是一种快速的零阶优化器，通过减少收敛所需的前向传递次数，实现了接近Adam的速度，同时保持了内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中GPU内存瓶颈问题，同时提升零阶优化器的收敛速度。

Method: 采用批量单边估计和自适应步长调整，结合Rademacher随机向量扰动和CUDA并行处理。

Result: FZOO在11个任务中平均比MeZO准确率提高3%，前向传递次数减少3倍，RoBERTa-large上准确率提升5.6%，前向传递减少18倍。

Conclusion: FZOO实现了单GPU上的高效全参数微调，并为内存高效的预训练提供了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

Conclusion: ANN 提供了一个可扩展、数据驱动的多智能体框架，结合了 LLMs 的协作能力和神经网络的高效灵活性。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.
