### [1] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，用于解决可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在硬件部署中的内存访问问题，通过神经架构搜索（NAS）和切片策略，在保持模型精度的同时显著减少DRAM访问次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其数据依赖的采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，难以高效部署到硬件上。现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 提出基于NAS的方法和切片策略，自动将输入特征划分为均匀块以避免内存冲突；设计FPGA验证系统测试性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，精度仅下降0.2%；在Xilinx FPGA上，DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持模型精度的同时显著优化了硬件性能，适合边缘侧部署。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [2] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DDCN的动态卷积网络，用于高效且准确的时空交通预测，解决了传统GNN和CNN在捕捉异质性和扩展性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在捕捉时空异质性和扩展性上的局限性，尤其是GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且难以扩展到大尺度数据的问题。

Method: 采用动态可变形卷积网络（DDCN），通过分解为编码器-解码器结构，并在编码器中应用空间和时空注意力块来突出重要特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN具有竞争性的性能，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN通过动态可变形卷积和注意力机制，实现了高效且准确的时空交通预测，为智能交通系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

### [3] [Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)
*Zejian Li,Yize Li,Chenye Meng,Zhongni Liu,Yang Ling,Shengyuan Zhang,Guang Yang,Changyuan Yang,Zhiyuan Yang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inversion-DPO是一种新的对齐框架，通过DDIM反演优化扩散模型，避免了奖励建模，提高了训练效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法需要计算密集型训练，可能导致模型准确性和效率下降。

Method: 利用DDIM反演重新设计Direct Preference Optimization（DPO），在噪声空间中采样，避免辅助奖励模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中表现优异，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型提供了一种高效、高精度的对齐方法，适用于复杂生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

### [4] [Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)
*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一个新颖的框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的时间建模和模态差异问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型（如LLMs）在时空预测中难以捕捉丰富的时空相关性，而视觉基础模型（VFMs）虽然具有强大的空间先验，但缺乏时间建模能力。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM两个重新编程阶段处理数据。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用时空预测框架，能够有效利用VFMs的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

### [5] [Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562)
*Ozer Can Devecioglu,Serkan Kiranyaz,Mehmet Yamac,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xOp-GAN是一种新型GAN模型，通过多个专家生成器网络分别处理不同质量范围的图像，提升水下图像恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单生成器网络难以捕捉水下图像的多样化退化问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出xOp-GAN，包含多个专家生成器，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，并通过判别器选择最佳结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器结构和判别器辅助推理，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

### [6] [Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11571)
*Varun Velankar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过元分析和大规模实验，评估了基于步态估计年龄的方法，发现多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），并分析了步态指标与年龄的相关性。深度学习模型表现最佳（96%准确率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，但现有方法在实验室和现实数据中存在差异，需建立更可靠的基准和指南。

Method: 结合元分析（59项研究）和大规模实验（OU-ISIR和VersatileGait数据集），评估卷积神经网络、惯性传感器等方法，并分析步态指标与年龄的相关性。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），深度学习模型准确率达96%。步态指标（如步长、速度）与年龄显著相关（相关系数≥0.27）。

Conclusion: 通过元分析和实验，论文为降低步态年龄估计误差（<3年）提供了实用指南和性能基准。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

### [7] [What cat is that? A re-id model for feral cats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11575)
*Victor Caquilpan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种改进的PPGNet模型（PPGNet-Cat），用于通过摄像头捕捉的图像重新识别野生野猫，以减少其对澳大利亚野生动物的危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野猫对澳大利亚野生动物造成严重威胁，需要有效监控以减少其影响。

Method: 改进PPGNet模型（原用于阿穆尔虎的重新识别），适应野猫特征，并探索对比学习方法如ArcFace损失。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，平均精度（mAP）达0.86，rank-1准确率为0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat在重新识别领域具有竞争力，为野猫监控提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

### [8] [InstructFLIP: Exploring Unified Vision-Language Model for Face Anti-spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12060)
*Kun-Hsiang Lin,Yu-Wen Tseng,Kang-Yang Huang,Jhih-Ciang Wu,Wen-Huang Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructFLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的指令调优框架，通过内容与风格解耦的指令增强跨域泛化能力，显著减少训练冗余并提升人脸反欺骗（FAS）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸反欺骗中攻击类型语义理解不足和跨域训练冗余的两大挑战。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和元域策略，提出指令调优框架InstructFLIP，将指令解耦为内容（欺骗语义）和风格（环境与相机特性）。

Result: 在多个域上超越现有最优模型（SOTA），显著减少训练冗余并提高准确性。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过文本引导和指令解耦有效提升跨域泛化能力，为人脸反欺骗提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

### [9] [SketchDNN: Joint Continuous-Discrete Diffusion for CAD Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11579)
*Sathvik Chereddy,John Femiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchDNN提出了一种生成CAD草图的模型，通过统一的连续-离散扩散过程联合建模连续参数和离散类别标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CAD草图中原始参数化的异质性和原始元素的排列不变性两大挑战。

Method: 采用Gaussian-Softmax扩散，通过高斯噪声扰动logits并通过softmax变换投影到概率单纯形上。

Result: 生成质量显著提升，FID从16.04降至7.80，NLL从84.8降至81.33。

Conclusion: 在SketchGraphs数据集上实现了CAD草图生成的最新成果。

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch
generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

### [10] [Interpretable Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Rectal Cancer MRI Using Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11638)
*Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Maryam Mohsin,Samuel D. Relton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的特征编码模型，用于提高直肠癌淋巴结转移（LNM）分期的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理形态的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，因此需要更有效的特征编码方法。

Method: 使用VAE替代大型预训练卷积神经网络（CNN），利用其生成模型特性直接编码视觉特征和有意义的数据模式。

Result: 在168名未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集上，提出的VAE-MLP模型实现了AUC 0.86、敏感性0.79和特异性0.85的优异性能。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在淋巴结转移分期中表现出色，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

### [11] [Posture-Driven Action Intent Inference for Playing style and Fatigue Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11642)
*Abhishek Jaiswal,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于姿势的心理状态推断方法，通过运动分析识别板球运动员的进攻和防守意图，取得了较高的准确率，并利用弱监督验证了结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 姿势推断在诊断疲劳、预防伤害和提升表现方面潜力巨大，但面临数据敏感性问题。体育场景为多样化情感状态数据提供了可行替代方案。

Method: 通过运动分析识别板球运动员的意图，利用现有数据统计作为弱监督验证。

Result: 方法在区分进攻和防守意图时达到75% F1分数和80% AUC-ROC。

Conclusion: 姿势泄露了意图推断的强信号，弱监督为解决数据标注限制提供了可能，研究为体育分析和行为分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

### [12] [VISTA: Monocular Segmentation-Based Mapping for Appearance and View-Invariant Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11653)
*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一种新颖的开放集单目全局定位框架，通过对象分割和跟踪以及子图对应搜索，解决了视角变化和季节变化带来的定位挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无结构环境中，传统定位方法因视角变化、季节变化等问题表现不佳，需要一种无需领域特定训练的方法。

Method: VISTA结合前端对象分割与跟踪管道，以及利用几何一致性的子图对应搜索。

Result: 在季节性和斜视角航空数据集上，VISTA的召回率比基线方法提高了69%，且地图大小仅为基线方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA在多样视角和季节变化下实现一致定位，适合资源受限平台实时运行。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

*Maciej Szankin,Vidhyananth Venkatasamy,Lihang Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在整体场景理解上更优，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR方法在噪声和字体变化下表现不佳，而新兴的VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs，并与PaddleOCRv4（CNN-based OCR）在ICDAR 2015和SVT数据集上进行了对比，加入了合成天气噪声以模拟真实场景。

Result: VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具有竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在特定场景下仍具优势，VLMs在复杂场景中表现更好。研究公开了天气增强的基准数据集和评估代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理密集对应关系时，通常假设视觉域一致，忽视了多样场景结构带来的挑战。

Method: 提出De-stylization Dual Branch处理域偏移，设计Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts模块适应场景多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CorrMoE在准确性和泛化能力上显著提升，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

Method: GRACE结合动态运动建模、语义文本细化（CATE模块）和基于熵正则化最优传输的跨模态对齐，定位情感显著特征。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，GRACE显著提升了识别性能，特别是在模糊或不平衡情感类别中，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: GRACE通过多模态细化和对齐，有效提升了动态面部表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征以降低频率，再通过解调恢复高频信息，有效减少混叠并保留细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息对语义分割精度至关重要，但传统下采样层易导致高频信息失真或混叠。

Method: 采用自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，设计多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）解调，并结合多尺度信息交互。

Result: SFM有效减少混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务（分类、对抗鲁棒性、实例分割等）。

Conclusion: SFM是一种通用且高效的方法，可无缝集成到多种架构中，显著提升任务性能。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 解决行人监控系统中因数据不足而难以应对复杂条件的问题。

Method: 利用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成合成数据集SEPose，包含多种环境和条件下的行人姿态数据。

Conclusion: SEPose展示了从模拟到现实的泛化能力，为事件传感器在行人监控中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰的多视角图像，而事件相机的高动态范围和高速度特性可以缓解这一问题。3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能重建辐射场，但在低光条件下仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，采用三重监督学习获取整体知识和细节，并引入色调匹配模块确保颜色一致性。同时创建了首个真实捕获的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功实现了辐射场重建。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS为低光环境下的多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估被动视觉感知，而心理可视化是核心认知能力，需更主动的评估方法。

Method: 设计了四个程序生成的谜题任务，分三个难度级别，评估MLLMs的表现。

Result: 当前MLLMs在心理可视化能力上与人类存在显著差距，部分模型仅能识别视觉模式。

Conclusion: 心理可视化仍是MLLMs的开放挑战，强化学习可能有助于提升视觉模拟能力。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Result: 在COCO-Position等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是解决多实例图像生成中关系和属性问题的有效方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Method: 定义OTP和VTP原型，采用渐进对齐和重加权机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PPAR有效提升了语义分割的泛化能力，验证了其理论合理性。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked

LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调整文本提示的开销过大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: GS-Bias引入全局偏置和空间偏置，直接添加到预训练模型的输出logits中，避免全反向传播，提高效率。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，例如在跨数据集和领域泛化中分别提升2.23%和2.72%，且内存占用仅为TPT的6.5%。

Conclusion: GS-Bias在高效性和性能上均优于现有方法，为TTA提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: EC-Diff在保持生成质量的同时显著加速推理，适用于边缘-云协作框架。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏细粒度标签，部件级特征研究较少，现有无监督方法在跨类别和场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: MPAE通过掩码图像学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，恢复部件形状。

Result: MPAE在复杂场景中能稳健地发现与实际物体形状匹配的部件，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督部件发现提供了新范式，解决了遮挡和跨类别部件相似性等挑战。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持各风格保真度的同时，实现了用户引导的区域化风格控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

TL;DR: ID-EA框架通过ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter改进文本嵌入与视觉身份嵌入的对齐，显著提升个性化肖像生成中的身份一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在个性化肖像生成中难以保持面部身份一致性，主要由于文本与视觉嵌入空间的语义不对齐。

Method: ID-EA包括ID-Enhancer（整合身份嵌入与文本锚点）和ID-Adapter（调整文本条件以保持身份），优化预训练UNet模型的注意力模块。

Result: ID-EA在身份保留指标上显著优于现有方法，且计算效率高，生成速度比现有方法快约15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA通过改进嵌入对齐，有效解决了身份一致性问题，为个性化肖像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公共遥感数据集中因分辨率差异和地物类别定义不一致导致的通用性不足问题，利用大量未标注数据。

Result: 在Potsdam数据集上验证了SAMST的有效性和可行性，提升了伪标签精度和模型性能。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力和小模型的训练效率，解决了遥感语义分割中标注数据不足的挑战。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有3D面部动画在细粒度风格化表情操纵上存在挑战，主要因缺乏合适的数据集。

Method: 基于32个标准AUs构建AUBlendSet数据集，并提出AUBlendNet网络预测AU-Blendshape基向量以实现风格化表情操纵。

Result: 通过多项任务验证了AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet的有效性，展示了其在3D面部动画中的潜力。

Conclusion: AUBlendSet是首个基于AUs的3D面部数据集，AUBlendNet首次实现任意身份的连续3D表情操纵。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FDAM的频率动态注意力调制策略，通过两种技术（AttInv和FreqScale）解决了ViTs中频率消失的问题，提升了多种视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，需要一种方法来动态调制频率响应。

Method: 提出FDAM策略，包含AttInv（通过反转低通滤波器生成高通滤波器）和FreqScale（加权不同频率成分），可轻松集成到ViTs中。

Result: 在SegFormer、DeiT和MaskDINO等模型上表现优异，提升了语义分割、目标检测和实例分割等任务的性能，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM通过动态调制频率响应，有效解决了ViTs的频率消失问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建视为稀疏信号问题，理论证明互补掩码的双重形式能提取域无关特征，提出MaskTwins框架。

Result: 实验证明MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，无需预训练即可提取域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为域自适应分割提供了新范式，展示了掩码重建在特征学习和域适应中的优势。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用深度学习模型填补自然电影刺激与fMRI采集之间的时间分辨率差距，并探索视觉处理的神经机制。

Method: 采用时间卷积层处理连续的影片帧输入，预测视觉皮层及其周围体素的活动，并通过显著性图分析贡献区域。

Result: 模型成功重建了视觉输入，发现中枕区、梭状区和距状区对解码贡献最大，分别对应形状感知、复杂识别和基本视觉特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习模型可以作为探索视觉处理机制的工具，尤其是在自然电影刺激下的神经活动解码。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于解耦-耦合策略的SS-DC框架，用于解决可见光到红外（RGB-IR）领域的无监督域自适应目标检测问题。通过光谱分解方法解耦域不变和域特定特征，并结合空间-光谱耦合方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其内部多个子域（如白天、夜晚、雾天场景），导致RGB-IR域适应效果不佳。解耦域不变和域特定特征被认为有助于提升性能。

Method: 设计了基于光谱分解的SAID模块，通过新颖的滤波器组和自蒸馏驱动的解耦损失实现特征解耦；提出空间-光谱耦合方法，结合解耦的域不变特征金字塔。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升基线性能，并在多个RGB-IR数据集上优于现有UDAOD方法，包括基于FLIR-ADAS数据集的新实验协议。

Conclusion: 通过解耦-耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测的性能，为多子域场景下的域适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

Motivation: 高质量开源数据集对深度学习发展至关重要，但其所有权保护面临挑战，现有验证技术不适用于掩码模型。

Method: 基于掩码信息重建难度的差异，提出DOV4MM方法验证黑盒模型是否在目标数据集上预训练。

Result: 在多个掩码图像和语言模型上验证，DOV4MM显著优于现有方法，p值远低于0.05。

Conclusion: DOV4MM为掩码模型的数据集所有权验证提供了有效解决方案，保护了数据集所有者的权益。

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD是首个探索多视图新类发现的方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于规划视角的运动预测方法，通过“先推理后预测”策略，结合行为意图作为空间指导，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的轨迹预测性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于逆向强化学习（IRL）的奖励驱动意图推理器，结合场景上下文特征，生成行为意图作为轨迹预测的先验。随后采用分层DETR-like解码器和双向选择性状态空间模型生成轨迹及其概率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模行为意图并结合规划视角，该方法在运动预测任务中实现了更高的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决无人机视角下小型敏捷多目标跟踪的三大挑战：目标外观特征稀缺、相机与目标动态复杂纠缠、频繁遮挡和身份模糊。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain检测增强框架和基于运动方向维护与自适应相似性度量的鲁棒跟踪器。

Result: 在SMOT4SB公开测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，性能领先。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Motivation: 现有方法如神经辐射场和高斯泼溅依赖于密集输入视角，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决从稀疏视角输入中重建车辆的挑战。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

Motivation: 热浪对公共健康构成威胁，但现有路线系统缺乏阴影信息。由于卫星图像噪声大且训练数据有限，难以直接估计阴影。

Method: 1. 构建包含多样区域的阴影数据集，利用Blender模拟不同太阳高度角下的建筑阴影。2. 提出DeepShade模型，结合RGB和Canny边缘层，通过对比学习捕捉阴影时间变化。

Result: 模型在生成阴影图像方面表现优异，应用于亚利桑那州坦佩的实际路线规划中，计算阴影比例。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端高温天气下的城市规划提供了参考，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Motivation: 医学图像分割网络在有限和不完美的数据集上容易发生前景与背景的误分类，OoD数据在其他视觉任务中的表现激发了这一研究。

Method: 提出Med-OoD框架，将OoD数据监督引入全监督医学图像分割，无需外部数据、特征正则化或额外标注，且无需修改网络架构。

Result: 在Lizard数据集上显著减少误分类，性能显著提升；仅使用OoD数据训练的网络达到76.1% mIoU。

Conclusion: Med-OoD展示了OoD数据在医学图像分割中的潜力，提出了一种新的学习范式，鼓励重新思考OoD数据的作用。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间结构的新型对抗人脸生成方法，无需迭代优化，仅需少量查询即可高效攻击人脸识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统（FRSs）的安全性和隐私性受到对抗攻击的严重威胁，尤其是在身份验证场景中。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间的结构特性，通过属性子球体生成对抗人脸，实现非自适应性和低查询量。

Result: 仅需100张人脸图像的单次非自适应查询，对AWS CompareFaces API的成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效，还能生成具有特定属性的对抗人脸，为FRSs的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态驾驶场景重建在数字孪生系统和自动驾驶模拟中至关重要，但现有方法在偏离输入轨迹时会出现背景和车辆模型损坏的问题，且存在不一致性、变形和耗时等限制。

Method: 提出LidarPainter，一种一步扩散模型，通过稀疏LiDAR条件和损坏的渲染实时恢复一致的驾驶视图，支持高保真车道变换。

Result: 实验表明，LidarPainter在速度、质量和资源效率上优于现有方法，比StreetCrafter快7倍，仅需五分之一的GPU内存，并支持通过文本提示（如“雾天”和“夜晚”）进行风格化生成。

Conclusion: LidarPainter在驾驶场景重建中表现出色，为现有资产库的多样化扩展提供了可能。

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

Abstract: We propose OVIGo-3DHSG method - Open-Vocabulary Indoor Grounding of objects
using 3D Hierarchical Scene Graph. OVIGo-3DHSG represents an extensive indoor
environment over a Hierarchical Scene Graph derived from sequences of RGB-D
frames utilizing a set of open-vocabulary foundation models and sensor data
processing. The hierarchical representation explicitly models spatial relations
across floors, rooms, locations, and objects. To effectively address complex
queries involving spatial reference to other objects, we integrate the
hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor
scenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust
object grounding compared to existing methods. Overall OVIGo-3DHSG demonstrates
strong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning and understanding
of indoor environments. Related materials can be found at

TL;DR: BSPF-ViT通过联合优化Q/K令牌的剪枝和融合，显著降低ViT的计算成本，同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT的高计算成本限制了实际应用，现有方法独立剪枝Q/K令牌导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion (BSPF-ViT)，联合评估令牌及其邻居，保留关键令牌并通过相似性融合压缩。

Result: 在DeiT-T和DeiT-S上分别提高ImageNet分类准确率1.3%和2.0%，计算开销减少50%，速度提升40%。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在降低计算成本的同时提升了性能，适用于各种ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架有效结合了双边网格的空间建模和MLP的非线性能力，提升了图像增强效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

Conclusion: AD-GS提供了一种高效且高质量的自监督解决方案，适用于驾驶场景渲染。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily

Conclusion: TGDA为细粒度视觉系统提供了一种高效且适应性强的替代方案，减少了对预训练的依赖。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小波变换的低光立体图像增强方法，通过特征空间解耦解决现有方法中特征高度纠缠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像存在复杂的退化问题，现有方法通常将所有退化因素编码在单一潜在空间中，导致特征高度纠缠和黑盒特性，容易引发捷径学习。

Method: 利用小波变换将特征空间分解为低频分支（用于光照调整）和多个高频分支（用于纹理增强），并提出高频引导的跨视角交互模块（HF-CIM）和基于交叉注意力的细节纹理增强模块（DTEM）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在光照调整和高频信息恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，该方法有效提升了低光立体图像的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

Result: 在多个数据集上，RODS显著提高了采样保真度和鲁棒性，检测并纠正了大量幻觉样本。

Conclusion: RODS是一种高效且低成本的改进方法，能够显著减少扩散模型中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用人脸质量相关属性，且缺乏有效的伪造感知训练策略。

Method: 扩展VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，引入属性驱动的混合LoRA策略、多粒度提示学习和伪造感知训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析上优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架通过多策略集成，显著提升了伪造检测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: 生成式模型在医学影像短语定位中具有显著优势，为临床实践提供了更鲁棒和可解释的工具。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Method: 构建了一个标注视频数据集，并提出了一种基线方法用于技能的时间分割。

Result: 结果显示该方法可行，但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为体操技能自动化评估提供了初步基础，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结局，结果显示域特异性预训练显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种常见的慢性肺病，预防干预措施可能带来严重风险，因此早期预测BPD结局至关重要，以避免对低风险婴儿的不必要毒性。

Method: 研究使用163名极低出生体重婴儿的胸部X光片，微调了ResNet-50模型，采用渐进层冻结和CutMix增强技术，并评估了线性探测方法。

Result: 最佳模型在预测中重度BPD时AUROC为0.78，平衡准确率为0.69，F1分数为0.67，域特异性预训练显著优于ImageNet初始化。

Conclusion: 研究表明，域特异性预训练结合渐进冻结和线性探测，能够从常规X光片中准确预测BPD结局，且计算可行，适合未来分布式学习部署。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现优异，但存在隐私泄露和偏见传播的风险，需要一种方法可靠地删除敏感概念。

Result: FADE在概念删除和图像质量上优于现有方法，性能提升5-10%。

Conclusion: FADE为安全公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可删除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Conclusion: 模块化设计支持灵活组件替换，为未来优化和实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Conclusion: DLC为扩散模型提供高效、组合性的输入表示，推动无条件图像生成和跨模态生成任务的发展。

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Conclusion: KeyDiff3D提供了一种高效、无需标注的3D关键点估计方法，并扩展了3D对象的操作能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features

*Kaiwen Huang,Yi Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yizhe Zhang,Chen Gong,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本驱动的半监督医学图像分割框架Text-SemiSeg，通过文本增强视觉语义嵌入，提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像标注成本高的问题，利用文本信息增强视觉语义理解。

Method: 包含三个模块：文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA）。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg有效利用文本信息增强视觉特征，提升半监督医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法可显著提升自动驾驶大规模数据集的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为QuRe的方法，通过硬负采样减少假阴性，提升组合图像检索（CIR）的准确性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽略其他图像的相关性，导致假阴性问题，影响用户满意度。

Method: 提出QuRe方法，结合奖励模型目标和硬负采样策略，选择相关图像以减少假阴性。

Result: QuRe在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最先进性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上表现出与人类偏好最强的对齐。

Conclusion: QuRe通过优化假阴性问题，显著提升了CIR的性能和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU损失函数，通过插值框解决现有IoU损失在非重叠情况下的梯度问题，提升小物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失在非重叠情况下不可导，且手工几何惩罚对框形状、大小和分布敏感，导致小物体检测效果不佳。

Method: 使用插值框与目标框的IoU作为损失项，避免手工惩罚；动态调整插值系数以适应不同物体分布。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC上优于现有IoU损失，小物体检测提升显著。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了现有IoU损失的问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

TL;DR: DVFL-Net是一种轻量级视频识别网络，通过知识蒸馏和时空特征调制，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在视频识别中计算成本高的问题，提出轻量级解决方案以适应实时应用。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制技术，从预训练的大模型中提取知识到小型学生模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低且内存占用少。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net在性能和效率之间取得平衡，适用于实时视频识别。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

Motivation: 针对文本密集图像的VQA任务，需要细粒度提取文本信息，DAM的区域级描述能力可能对此有益。

Method: 提出DAM-QA框架，整合DAM的区域感知能力，通过多区域视图聚合答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中，DAM-QA显著优于基线DAM，DocVQA上提升7+分，且参数更少。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本密集VQA任务中的潜力，结合高效使用策略可缩小与通用VLMs的差距。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Conclusion: SENTINEL在减少幻觉和保持模型通用能力方面表现出色，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像解读提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded

present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Conclusion: AI为可持续技术生态系统提供了研究方向，结合科学、艺术和环保实践，推动未来生态设计的发展。

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on
sustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems.

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of
perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM
backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为验证器的潜力及其局限性，并提出了一种名为自我基础验证（SGV）的方法来提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）中，如何利用MLLMs作为验证器以扩展AI的进展是一个挑战。

Method: 提出自我基础验证（SGV）方法，通过无条件生成和条件生成两步来利用MLLMs的知识和推理能力。

Result: SGV方法显著提升了MLLMs的验证性能，在准确性和失败检测率上提高了20个百分点，并在多个任务中实现了新的最佳表现。

Conclusion: SGV方法有效解决了MLLMs作为验证器时的偏见问题，显著提升了其性能，为AI在复杂领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了DP-Bench基准和DPLM模型，用于自动化动态规划问题的建模，通过DualReflect数据生成方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态规划建模传统上依赖专家知识，LLMs有潜力自动化这一过程，但现有方法难以直接应用。

Method: 提出DP-Bench基准和DPLM模型，采用DualReflect合成数据生成方法，结合前向和后向生成。

Result: DPLM性能媲美顶尖LLMs，在难题上表现更优；DualReflect在低数据和高数据场景下各有优势。

Conclusion: 结合前向和后向生成的数据方法在动态规划问题中具有互补性，DPLM为自动化建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更强大、灵活的基础框架。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生物系统（如蜜蜂）利用有限感官和计算能力实现飞行和避障，启发无人机导航研究。

Method: 训练强化学习代理仅使用光流作为感官输入，在障碍隧道中导航，并分析其注意力模式。

Result: 代理主要关注光流不连续区域和大光流区域，导航行为类似于昆虫飞行。

Conclusion: 这种策略可能适用于开发无人机简单显式控制法则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑增强的多智能体强化学习方法（TPE-MARL），用于优化混合交通中联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的协作决策，通过压缩高维状态信息和减少搜索空间，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）在混合交通中面临状态-动作空间指数增长的挑战，探索-利用权衡问题尤为突出。

Method: 构建动态交通流的游戏拓扑张量压缩高维信息，以QMIX为基础，结合访问计数和智能体互信息，建立拓扑增强的MARL框架。

Result: 在不同交通密度和CAV渗透率下，TPE-MARL在交通效率、安全性、决策平滑性和任务完成度上表现优异，决策合理性接近或超过人类驾驶员。

Conclusion: TPE-MARL有效平衡了探索与利用，为混合交通中的协作决策提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Result: 在大规模动态环境问题（如直升机紧急场景）中显著优于现有在线基准。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于复杂动态环境的在线规划。

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance

Motivation: 评估LLMs在复杂棋盘游戏中的空间战略推理能力，填补现有研究的不足。

Method: 采用多阶段训练：合法移动预测、战略注释整合、强化学习（GRPO）。

Result: Xiangqi-R1模型在移动合法性和分析准确性上分别提升18%和22%。

Conclusion: 该框架为空间复杂领域的通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

TL;DR: 研究将大语言模型（LLMs）作为“主观文学评论家”，探讨其在文学评估中的审美偏好和评价模式。通过分析十篇日本科幻短篇小说的翻译文本，发现LLMs在评价一致性和模式上存在显著差异，并揭示了其独特的评价词汇和潜在价值体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在文学评估中的表现，揭示其是否具有类似人类批评流派的个体化评价特征，而非中立基准工具。

Method: 将十篇日本科幻小说翻译成英文，由六种先进LLMs进行七次独立评估，采用主成分分析和聚类技术分析数据。

Result: 发现LLMs评价一致性差异显著（α值1.00至0.35），识别出五种评价模式，且不同模型的评价词汇具有独特性。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备类似人类批评流派的个体化评价特征，而非单纯的中立评估工具。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准以英语为主，限制了其全球适用性，因此需要开发多语言基准以促进全球包容性视觉语言模型的发展。

Method: 采用解耦管道，分离图表数据和渲染代码，通过翻译数据和重用代码生成多语言图表，并利用先进的LLM翻译和严格质量控制确保一致性。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

Method: 引入MapIQ数据集，包含14,706个问题-答案对，覆盖三种地图类型和六个主题，评估MLLMs在六种视觉分析任务中的表现。

Result: 通过实验比较MLLMs的性能与人类基线，并分析地图设计变化对模型鲁棒性和敏感性的影响。

Conclusion: MapIQ为Map-VQA研究提供了更全面的基准，揭示了MLLMs的局限性及改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在波斯语中使用少样本学习和增量学习方法进行跨语言情感分析，目标是利用高资源语言的知识开发适用于有限数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在数据有限的波斯语中执行情感分析的模型，同时利用高资源语言的知识。

Method: 使用三种预训练多语言模型（XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT），通过少样本和增量学习方法在波斯语数据上进行微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa表现最佳，达到96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型的方法在波斯语情感分析中非常有效。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

TL;DR: PgM框架通过模态分割器和学习组件，分别学习单模态和配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的效果和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，单模态和配对模态特征的分离学习可以提升任务适应性和学习效率。

Method: 提出PgM框架，包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和解码器，分别处理不同特征。

Result: 实验证明PgM在四项多模态任务中有效，且能迁移至现有模型。特征分布可视化提供了深入见解。

Conclusion: PgM通过分离学习单模态和配对模态特征，显著提升了多模态学习的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Result: 在TableVQA-Bench基准测试中表现优于现有基线，提高了可解释性和透明度。

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA为敏感领域的表格问答系统提供了可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合有限语法分析和LLM的笔记本理解方法CRABS，用于生成信息流图和执行依赖图，解决了LLM在笔记本理解中的幻觉和长上下文问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于重新执行笔记本以理解其信息流和操作不切实际，且LLM在理解复杂笔记本时存在幻觉和长上下文问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用CRABS策略，结合浅层语法分析和AST解析，辅以LLM的零样本学习，准确识别笔记本中单元格的输入输出。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上测试，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法有效解决了笔记本理解中的挑战，为笔记本的评估和重用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解LLMs如何管理相互矛盾的信息，特别是注意力头在其中的作用，以澄清现有研究中的不一致发现。

Method: 研究方法包括复现和整合多项近期研究的发现，使用机制解释工具分析注意力头的行为，并评估其与事实输出比例的关系。

Result: 研究发现，促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用的复制抑制机制而非选择性反事实抑制实现其功能，且其行为具有领域依赖性，更大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 结论表明，注意力头的行为机制是通用的而非选择性的，且其效果受模型规模和领域特异性的影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Motivation: 自回归语言模型的顺序生成特性限制了推理速度和并行性，尤其是在文本方向和语义相对确定的后期阶段。

Method: 结合掩码输入、门控LoRA、轻量采样器、辅助训练损失和推测生成策略，实现多令牌预测。

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升近2.5倍，且质量无损失。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了自回归模型的生成效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient

biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Conclusion: DualReward提供了一种灵活框架，平衡从可靠人类示例中学习和探索高质量干扰项的能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部对有害性的理解与拒绝行为是分离的，提出了一种新的安全机制（Latent Guard），用于检测不安全输入并减少过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正理解有害性，而不仅仅是机械拒绝，并分析其内部安全机制。

Method: 通过识别有害性方向与拒绝方向的分离，验证其因果效应，并开发Latent Guard作为安全应用。

Result: 发现有害性概念在LLMs内部独立存在，某些越狱方法仅减少拒绝信号而不改变有害性判断。Latent Guard性能优于专用安全模型。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更稳健，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF揭示了多语言指令跟随的挑战，包括关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循问题。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合信息熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，显著提升了压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵压缩词汇单元，忽略了注意力关键令牌和压缩过程中熵的变化，导致效果受限。

Method: 提出DAC方法，动态整合熵和注意力信息，实现细粒度提示压缩。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K、BBH）的实验表明，DAC在各种任务和LLM中均表现优异。

Conclusion: DAC方法通过动态感知熵变化和注意力信息，显著提升了任务无关提示压缩的效果。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLMs间注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化注意力计算和KV缓存使用，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有优化方法未充分利用外部信息。

Method: 分析注意力矩阵相似性，提出IAM框架，通过小规模与大规模LLMs间的注意力映射实现优化。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: IAM具有通用性，且与现有KV缓存优化方法正交，是提升LLM效率的有效工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下超越现有整数量化，反量化速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架在低精度和推理速度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Motivation: 在线交流中，低资源语言和方言的翻译系统常无法保留本地俚语、混合语和文化嵌入的有害言论标记，且缺乏平行数据和安全性过滤器。

Method: 1. 人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选和排序标注者选定的Singlish目标示例；2. 通过直接和回译的语义相似性优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了框架的有效性和效率，提升了翻译质量并支持多文化低资源环境下的安全内容审核。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了翻译质量，还通过保留社会语言细微差别，支持了多文化低资源环境下的安全内容审核和基准测试。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Conclusion: 研究结果支持人类与AI协同学习的有效策略，并扩展了先前的研究发现。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Motivation: 探索价值相似性在人工社会中是否与人类社会中一样重要，验证LLM模拟社会现象的有效性。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值控制的有效性；主实验生成具有特定价值的智能体对，分析对话后的互评结果。

Result: 价值相似性高的智能体对表现出更强的互信和亲密关系，且结果在英语和日语中一致。

Conclusion: LLM模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，揭示了价值影响关系建立的机制，并为新理论提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了简化对多义词定义完整性的影响，发现简化会显著降低定义质量，而通过微调模型可以改善这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）提供准确的多义词定义时，简化可能导致关键信息丢失，误导用户。

Method: 使用LLM-as-Judge和人工标注评估简化对多义词定义的影响，测试了多个模型，并通过微调Llama 3.1 8B改进结果。

Result: 简化显著降低了定义的完整性，而微调模型显著提升了多义词定义的质量。

Conclusion: 在自然语言处理教育应用中，需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在语言创造力任务中表现优异，但人类和LLMs在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF填补了书籍规模共指消解评估的空白，为未来研究提供了新资源和新挑战。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale

Method: 采用MEGA方法（结合多种教学策略）与传统逐步法对比，通过随机分组设计评估两种方法的效果。

Result: MEGA方法在GSM8K和MATH数据集上表现更优，尤其在难度较高的MATH数据集中显著优于逐步法（47.5% vs 26.67%）。

Conclusion: MEGA方法在解释复杂数学问题时更有效，适合提升学生的数学学习体验。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保真度和稳定性方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析（衡量语义一致性）和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR，评估语义漂移）。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率上表现最佳；在BERTopic任务中，主题粒度提升400%且完全消除重叠。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为LLM增强在NLP流水线中的结构化评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为生成语言模型建立可测试的高标准评估方法，通过类似课堂考试的步骤评估模型的文本理解能力。

Method: 采用三步评估法（问题生成、回答、评分），使用多语言和多来源测试材料，并对比自动与人工评估。

Result: 发现LLMs在问题生成和答案限制上表现不佳，自动评估方法存在误判问题。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成和答案限制的评估策略，自动评估方法需进一步优化。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

### [134] [Toward a Behavioural Translation Style Space: Simulating the Temporal Dynamics of Affect, Behaviour, and Cognition in Human Translation Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12208)
*Michael Carl,Takanori Mizowaki,Aishvarya Ray,Masaru Yamada,Devi Sri Bandaru,Xinyue Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述可能的翻译行为模式，并通过分层结构分析眼动和手指运动等行为数据，揭示背后的认知和情感过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过行为数据（如眼动和手指运动）揭示翻译过程中的隐藏认知和情感状态，从而更好地理解翻译行为。

Method: 通过分析击键和注视数据，构建多层嵌套的BTSS，并将其作为计算翻译代理的基础。

Result: BTSS能够模拟翻译过程中情感、自动行为和认知的时间动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为理解翻译行为提供了新视角，并为计算翻译代理的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索了一种在低资源环境下无需自动语音识别（ASR）的孤立词阅读评估方法，通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，使用自监督学习（SSL）模型编码，发现SSL表示在处理儿童语音时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境下，传统的自动语音识别（ASR）方法难以适用，因此需要探索无需ASR的评估方法，尤其是针对儿童语音的评估。

Method: 采用少量样本（few-shot）方法，将儿童语音输入与成人提供的参考模板进行比较，使用SSL模型的中间层进行编码，并研究了离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验显示，成人语音输入表现良好，但儿童语音输入性能显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表示在低资源语音任务中表现良好，但在少量样本分类系统中处理儿童语音时存在明显局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

### [136] [Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252)
*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，通过LLM提升ASR对上下文相关关键词的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳，而现有方法在词级和短语级融合中各有局限性。

Method: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级的优势，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最优性能，同时保持了非关键词文本的高准确率。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中词级和短语级组件相互补充，显著提升了性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

*Yikang Liu,Wanyang Zhang,Yiming Wang,Jialong Tang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Fei Huang,Rui Wang,Hai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译质量量化指标T-index，通过对比微调的语言模型计算，能够有效测量翻译文本的翻译特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU、COMET）未能充分捕捉翻译特性（translationese），需要一种新的量化方法。

Method: 使用两个对比微调的语言模型（0.5B参数）计算T-index，并在合成数据和真实翻译数据上验证其泛化性和有效性。

Result: T-index在少量数据（1-5k对）下表现稳健，能有效预测人工标注的翻译特性差异，并与人工评分显著相关（Pearson's r=0.568）。

Conclusion: T-index是一种独立于现有MT质量评估指标的补充工具，能够有效量化翻译特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infherno是一个基于LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库的端到端框架，旨在将自由格式的临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源，解决现有方法的泛化性和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HL7 FHIR标准在临床数据集成中具有重要性，但现有方法（如模块化规则系统或LLM）在泛化性和结构一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出Infherno框架，结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，实现端到端的FHIR资源转换。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现优异，接近人类基准，并支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性。

Conclusion: Infherno为临床数据集成提供了一种高效、结构化的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化的文本异常检测评估基准，限制了方法的比较和创新。

Method: 利用多种预训练语言模型（如GloVe、BERT、LLaMa等）的嵌入，结合多领域数据集和评估指标（AUROC、AUPRC）进行系统评估。

Result: 嵌入质量显著影响异常检测效果，深度学习模型在LLM嵌入下未优于传统方法；跨模型性能矩阵呈现低秩特性。

Conclusion: 开源基准工具包为未来研究提供了基础，支持高效模型评估和选择。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

TL;DR: 研究评估了现有代码LLMs在VHDL代码生成和摘要任务中的表现，发现其性能不足，并提出了一种名为Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes)的新方法，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现优异，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）领域的评估和改进研究较少。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或代码）来增强LLMs的输入提示。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在多个指标上显著优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅提升了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量，还为未来改进代码LLMs提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现性别偏见显著影响阿尔茨海默病（AD）语音感知，男性语音更易被识别为AD，尤其在中文语音中。声学分析显示男性语音的shimmer值与AD感知显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的影响，揭示其对AD检测模型开发的潜在影响。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值和语音部分）。

Result: 男性语音更频繁被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语音部分与AD识别呈负相关。语言对AD感知无显著影响。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在AD检测模型中解决此问题，并进一步验证跨语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，用于提升大语言模型（LLMs）在检测和解决用户请求模糊性方面的能力，实验证明该框架显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在处理用户请求时的模糊性问题，提升其检测和解决能力。

Method: 引入并评估了一个多智能体辩论框架，包含三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B和Mistral-7B变体）和一个多样化模糊性数据集。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升了Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B变体的性能，其中Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率达到76.7%，尤其在复杂模糊性和高效共识方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 辩论框架是一种有效的方法，可以增强LLMs的能力，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖静态数据，而具备网页浏览能力的LLMs可以实时获取信息，但其在社交媒体数据上的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个X/Twitter账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs访问社交媒体内容并预测用户属性的能力。

Result: LLMs能够访问社交媒体内容并预测用户属性，但分析显示其对低活跃度账户存在性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 该能力对计算社会科学有潜力，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公开应用中的功能，保留研究用途的受控访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否可用于检测算术错误，以提升模型的自我纠正能力。

Method: 从3位数加法开始，训练探针解码隐藏状态；扩展到结构化思维链任务，验证泛化能力；通过选择性重提示改进任务准确性。

Result: 探针能准确解码模型预测和正确答案；错误检测器准确率超90%；探针在复杂任务中表现一致；选择性重提示提升任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为轻量级模型自我纠正提供可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据进行决策，但现有LLMs和传统RAG在处理异构数据时存在局限性。

Method: 采用混合检索策略（密集嵌入和BM25）、元数据过滤、语义分块和量化索引，结合人工反馈和对话记忆。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，Mean Reciprocal Rank提升16%，定性评估得分更高。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了企业任务的响应质量，未来将扩展至多模态数据和基于代理的检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

Motivation: 开放权重的推理语言模型生成的思维链可能包含有害内容，研究旨在探索能否通过CoT预测最终输出的对齐问题。

Method: 评估了多种监控方法（人类、大语言模型、文本分类器），比较了基于CoT文本和激活的预测效果。

Result: 基于CoT激活的线性探针显著优于文本方法，能提前准确预测最终输出的安全性。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可实现实时安全监控和早期干预，适用于不同规模和类型的模型。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Motivation: 传统VAE-NTMs在建模高维文本数据的超球面潜在表示时容易发生后验崩溃，导致潜在表示无效。

Result: 实验表明，S2WTM在生成主题的一致性和多样性上优于现有方法，并提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: S2WTM通过改进潜在空间建模，有效解决了后验崩溃问题，提升了主题建模的效果。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BETR的数据选择方法，通过显式优化将预训练数据与评估基准对齐，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索显式优化数据选择目标对模型性能的影响，而非依赖隐式的基准驱动迭代。

Method: BETR方法通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全库分数。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在10个任务中的9个上优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍，且适用于不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: 结论指出，直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需适应模型规模。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在教育中的潜力及其带来的问题，如AI幻觉、错误传播和偏见，以推动更有效的AI整合。

Method: 通过文献综述分析生成式AI在教育中的应用及其影响。

Result: 生成式AI提高效率并支持创意，但需人类监督以解决其问题。建议混合评估模型、偏见检测框架和AI素养教育。

Conclusion: 成功整合AI需平衡伦理、教学和技术因素。未来研究可关注AI准确性提升、学术诚信保护及创意与精度的平衡。

Abstract: This paper surveys the use of Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and
Claude, in computer science education, focusing on key aspects of accuracy,
authenticity, and assessment. Through a literature review, we highlight both
the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI
improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such
as AI hallucinations, error propagation, bias, and blurred lines between
AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for
addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid
assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias
detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and
educators. Our findings suggest that the successful integration of AI requires
a balanced approach, considering ethical, pedagogical, and technical factors.
Future research may explore enhancing AI accuracy, preserving academic
integrity, and developing adaptive models that balance creativity with
precision.

TL;DR: 研究发现生成式AI在简历筛选中存在种族和性别偏见，且部分模型仅依赖关键词匹配而非实质性评估，提出了‘中立假象’概念，建议双重验证框架以确保公平有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在简历筛选中是否真正具备评估能力，而非仅因表面无偏见而被误认为中立。

Method: 通过两部分实验审计八种主要AI平台：实验1检测种族和性别偏见，实验2评估核心能力。

Result: 实验1发现复杂的情境偏见，实验2揭示部分模型仅依赖关键词匹配，无法实质性评估。

Conclusion: 提出‘中立假象’概念，建议双重验证框架（偏见和能力）以确保AI工具的公平性和有效性。

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a
two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex,
contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates
merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated
core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared
unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation,
relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the
"Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of
bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.
This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation
framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable
competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Result: AI可辅助研究，但需警惕自动化陷阱，数据科学家在VUCA环境中至关重要。

Conclusion: 推动AI工具发展，同时加强方法培训，确保研究的实质价值与伦理应用。

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys,
synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While
the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not
always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice
(TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models
for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024),
we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic
AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human
analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their
tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier
eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using
statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully
understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize
a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018)
throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role
that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging
the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for
continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value
of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon
results most effectively and ethically.

Method: 通过系统综述10种早期EEG-FMs，分析其基于序列建模（如Transformer）和掩码序列重建的自监督方法。

Result: 发现当前EEG-FMs评估方法不统一且有限，难以评估其实用性。

Conclusion: 未来需标准化评估、扩大规模效应，并与领域专家合作开发工具和方法，以提升EEG-FMs的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography
(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The
inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their
over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards
general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models
(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the
real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research
progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of
first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current
state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,
this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their
methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that
most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on
transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for
self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely
limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.
In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work
should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and
trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We
believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,
and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the
translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Motivation: 尽管Wi-Fi CSI在远程感知应用中表现出潜力，但其泛化能力仍不足以实际部署。本文受NeRF启发，旨在通过3D潜在运动表示提升HAR的鲁棒性。

Method: 从Wi-Fi CSI提取的一维Doppler速度投影中重建3D潜在运动表示，并构建统一的Doppler辐射场（DoRF）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了Wi-Fi HAR的泛化准确性。

Conclusion: DoRF在实用感知应用中具有强大潜力，为Wi-Fi HAR提供了更全面的运动视图。

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for
remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity
projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that
is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However,
despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for
practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a
volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a
novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation
from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The
resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler
radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the
performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability.
The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the
generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential
of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

Conclusion: 相空间方法为量子机器学习提供了一种新的可行路径，解决了传统方法的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit
synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking
effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made

<details>

Motivation: 现有极化解码器在删除信道中计算复杂度高（O(N^4)），限制了其应用。

Method: 扩展NPD架构以支持删除信道，仅修改其中一个神经网络，复杂度降至O(AN log N)。

Result: 在删除率δ∈{0.01, 0.1}的信道中验证了NPD性能，并展示了列表解码的改进。

Conclusion: 扩展的NPD有望应用于未来技术（如DNA存储）。

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with
a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit
high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This
limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to
short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing
NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we
extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,
the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating
fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support
deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational
complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a
computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.
We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates
$\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by
the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced
complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further
improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have
applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

Conclusion: 结合枚举技术和SharpASP-SR的混合方法，实现了在析取程序上的最先进性能。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for
knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has
emerged as an important computational problem with applications in
probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This
has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While
substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development
of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of
disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected
propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative
characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring
that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows
SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.
Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate
that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with
large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid
counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to
achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive
programs.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich
insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells.
Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of
vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of
biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to
the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast
numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue
morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene
expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale
Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale
information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices
that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2)
Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the
sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest
high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves
outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region
semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive
understanding of ST data

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm
robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning
presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies
on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for
learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of
attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,
thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules
across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the
curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian
learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive
prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This
work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,
resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved
swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning
rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in
standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling
narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain
results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We
introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted
principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses,
Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),
and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel
sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the
same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this
result.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟人类如何动态且真实地对多样化的听觉刺激做出反应是角色动画中的关键挑战，但现有研究多忽略空间音频信号对运动的影响。

Method: 开发了一个简单但有效的基于扩散的生成框架（MOSPA），通过融合机制捕捉身体运动与空间音频的关系。

Result: MOSPA能够根据不同的空间音频输入生成多样且逼真的人体运动，实验表明其在该任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法为空间音频驱动的人体运动生成提供了高质量基准，未来将开源模型和数据集。

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary
video for more details.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的3D层次代理节点表示方法，解决了现有3D表示方法的局限性，如任务特定性、编辑复杂性和保真度与复杂性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D表示方法（如网格、体素、点云和NeRF）在通用性、编辑性和保真度方面存在显著不足，限制了其在重建、生成、编辑和驱动等任务中的应用。

Method: 通过稀疏的层次化代理节点（树状结构）表示物体的形状和纹理，每个节点存储局部信息（由小型MLP隐式编码），并通过神经插值和轻量解码查询3D坐标属性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3D重建和编辑中表现出高效的表达能力、高保真渲染质量和卓越的可编辑性。

Conclusion: 提出的3D层次代理节点表示方法在通用性、保真度和编辑性方面优于现有方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

TL;DR: DCASE2025挑战赛任务3聚焦于立体声音频数据的声音事件定位与检测（SELD），引入新的数据集和基线系统，并修改评估指标以适应有限视场（FOV）场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从传统的四声道音频转向立体声音频，以研究更常见的有限视场场景中的SELD问题，并解决立体声音频固有的角度模糊性。

Method: 使用立体声音频和视频帧作为输入，基线系统整合了事件分类、定位以及新的屏幕内外分类子任务。

Result: 基线系统在立体声音频数据上表现良好。

Conclusion: DCASE2025任务3为有限视场场景的SELD研究提供了新的数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3
of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In
previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order
Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge
investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change
shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene
analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited
field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,
the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane
(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided
into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track
introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification
necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3
Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled
and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to
process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to
the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates
onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation
metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,
which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are
onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs
reasonably well with the stereo audio data.

Motivation: 传统方法将这些任务分开处理，而RUMAA通过统一框架解决这些问题，尤其是处理带有重复符号的乐谱时表现更优。

Method: 使用预训练的乐谱和音频编码器，结合三流解码器，通过代理任务捕捉任务间的依赖关系，实现乐谱与表演音频的对齐。

Result: 在公开钢琴音乐数据集中，RUMAA在非重复乐谱上达到最先进水平，在重复乐谱上表现更优，同时在转录和错误检测任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: RUMAA提供了一个高效的端到端解决方案，显著提升了音乐表演分析的性能。

Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music
performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment,
score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end
manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA
integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel
tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It
aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length
performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on
manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA
matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and
outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while
also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.

TL;DR: QTTS是一种基于QDAC音频编解码器的新型TTS框架，通过多码本建模和并行预测提升合成质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归TTS方法因单码本表示导致信息丢失，难以恢复细节（如韵律、音色），尤其在复杂场景（如歌声合成）中表现不佳。

Method: QTTS采用QDAC编解码器，结合分层并行架构和延迟多头方法，实现高质量和快速合成。

Result: 实验表明QTTS在合成质量和表达内容保留上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多码本建模是实现高保真、通用语音和音频生成的有前景方向。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete
modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on
single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information
loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these
methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,
speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing
voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our
new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end
training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves
superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless
compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies:
the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model
inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay
Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to
accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive
content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via
multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity,
general-purpose speech and audio generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级运行时监控框架，用于实时验证神经证书的安全性，无需访问底层控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的形式验证方法因状态空间探索的复杂性而难以扩展，因此需要一种更高效的验证方法。

Method: 通过运行时监控系统行为，实时验证证书在有限预测范围内的安全性，特别针对ReLU控制屏障函数。

Result: 在案例研究中展示了该框架的实用性，能够及时检测安全违规和错误证书。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经证书的静态验证提供了一种轻量级且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems
control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as
barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,
serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal
verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability
challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this
challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that
integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying
control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs
on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure
safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for
ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical
effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety
violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an
effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the
certificates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高维计算模型在表示复杂的类-子类关系时面临挑战，尤其是在分解任务中。

Method: FactorHD采用符号编码方法嵌入额外记忆子句，并设计高效分解算法选择性消除冗余类。

Result: FactorHD在10^9表示规模下速度提升约5667倍，与ResNet-18结合在Cifar-10数据集上达到92.48%分解准确率。

Conclusion: FactorHD克服了现有模型的局限性，为神经符号AI系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical
analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising
brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various
HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class
relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,
where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,
they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI
systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of
representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.
FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization
clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it
employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates
redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.
Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in
representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,
overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition
catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves
approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to
existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,
FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

TL;DR: 论文比较了Transformer、SSM和混合模型在长上下文推理任务中的性能，发现SSM在长序列处理上优于Transformer，并提出了硬件优化的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在处理长上下文输入时存在二次复杂度和高内存需求的问题，需要探索更高效的架构如SSM和混合模型。

Method: 通过系统性的性能对比测试，评估Transformer、SSM和混合模型在消费级和嵌入式GPU上的表现。

Result: SSM在长序列处理上表现更优，能处理220K tokens，比Transformer快4倍；Transformer在短序列上快1.8倍。

Conclusion: SSM在长上下文任务中更具优势，硬件优化应聚焦于定制SSM内核，以提升边缘设备的性能。

Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous,
long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic
complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures
make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a
paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and
hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses
on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic
performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically
needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of
carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for
long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that
SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing
sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than
comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short
sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x
faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals
that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime,
accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a
primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed,
device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the
edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization
framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间物理信息模型（SPIM），用于改进高级封装中的非破坏性测试（NDT），通过磁图像增强、对齐和反演方法，提高了测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高级封装的非破坏性测试因层深和复杂性而变得困难，现有方法未考虑涡流效应和图像对齐问题。

Method: SPIM包含磁图像增强、对齐和基于毕奥-萨伐尔定律与FFT的反演方法。

Result: SPIM提高了I通道清晰度0.3%，减少Q通道清晰度25%，并消除了0.30的旋转和倾斜偏差。

Conclusion: SPIM展示了空间分析与物理驱动模型结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

Motivation: 研究AI模型防护机制的漏洞，揭示通过微调（fine-tuning）可以完全绕过现有防护，生成有害内容，强调需要更强大的防护措施。

Method: 采用jailbreak-tuning方法，通过微调模型（包括开放权重和封闭API），使其能够生成详细且高质量的有害响应。

Result: 实验证明，OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的模型会完全响应有害请求（如CBRN协助、网络攻击等），且新模型对此类攻击更脆弱。

Conclusion: 当前模型对恶意微调攻击缺乏抵抗力，亟需开发防篡改的防护机制，同时建议谨慎发布可微调模型。

Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers
broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However,
this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed
fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work
which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal
of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches
models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful
requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply
with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal
activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but
also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more
effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in
the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent
ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,
underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such
safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release
of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally
capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its
capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人脸识别系统的广泛应用，用户隐私保护变得尤为重要。传统同态加密方法在保护人脸模板时效率低下，亟需一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Method: 提出了IDFace方法，结合模板表示变换和空间高效编码技术，优化了加密模板的匹配效率和存储空间。

Result: 实验表明，IDFace能在126毫秒内从100万个加密模板中识别出人脸模板，仅比明文识别慢2倍。

Conclusion: IDFace在保护隐私的同时显著提升了效率，为人脸识别系统的安全性和实用性提供了新思路。

Abstract: As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy
becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's
face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered
from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as
homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,
HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In
particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is
basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined
shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and
the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based
face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain
systems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based
secure and efficient face identification method with template protection.
IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching
on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The
first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply
reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient
encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving
the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show
that IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted
templates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification
over plaintexts.

advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting
challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing
returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents
capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in
and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus
on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and
discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative
potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive
framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation
across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We
distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research
processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified
taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and
human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of
current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey
delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific
innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing
processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological
foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical
guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also
highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of
increasingly autonomous AI-driven science. Resources related to this survey can

### [178] [Galaxy image simplification using Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11692)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Lior Shamir*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成式AI的新方法，用于简化星系图像并自动将其转换为“骨架化”形式，从而实现对星系形状的准确测量和分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数字巡天项目拍摄了数十亿个星系的图像，但高精度分析这些海量图像需要有效的自动化方法。现有方法通常依赖于基于预定义类别的机器学习标注，限制了分析的灵活性。

Method: 采用生成式AI技术，将星系图像简化为“骨架化”形式，避免了预定义类别的限制。

Result: 该方法成功应用于12.5万张DESI Legacy Survey图像，生成的简化图像目录已公开。

Conclusion: 新方法提供了一种更灵活且准确的星系图像分析途径，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of
galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the
shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images
requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning
annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we
introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative
AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them
into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements
of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined
set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images
acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available.
The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of
the simplified images is publicly available.

Motivation: 填补当前可视化研究中修辞构造视角的不足，揭示数据可视化作为说服工具的根本机制。

Method: 采用修辞图式理论，收集并分析了90幅19世纪至今的章鱼地图，研究其视觉隐喻和修辞策略。

Result: 发现章鱼地图在现代仍活跃，且修辞策略因文化背景不同而动态变化。

Conclusion: 通过章鱼地图的案例，讨论了说服性可视化的伦理问题。

Abstract: When designed deliberately, data visualizations can become powerful
persuasive tools, influencing viewers' opinions, values, and actions. While
researchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of
persuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion
resides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in
current visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis
of octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across
centuries and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema
theory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th
century to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement
their persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual
metaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies
are applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the
above analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings. For instance,
contrary to the common perception that octopus maps are primarily a historical
phenomenon, our research shows that they remain a lively design convention in
today's digital age. Additionally, while most octopus maps stem from Western
discourse that views the octopus as an evil symbol, some designs offer
alternative interpretations, highlighting the dynamic nature of rhetoric across
different sociocultural settings. Lastly, drawing from the lessons provided by
octopus maps, we discuss the associated ethical concerns of persuasive
visualization.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the
resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits,
such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient
way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their
genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the
workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic
prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the
models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,
which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we
proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice
breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally
ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual
projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual
analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene
visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory
genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the
quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified
regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback
from breeders.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 生成式AI不仅复制人类创造力，还再现了根深蒂固的文化偏见。本研究探讨了四种AI模型如何理解和表达“丑陋”，揭示了其中嵌入的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批判性分析生成式AI对“丑陋”的理解和表达，揭示其背后的文化和社会偏见。

Method: 通过迭代提示提取13个与“丑陋”相关的形容词，生成624张图像，并进行人口统计和社会经济属性的编码与主题分析。

Result: AI模型倾向于将“丑陋”与老年白人男性形象关联，反映了社会偏见和矛盾性偏见。传统物理标记（如不对称和衰老）仍是核心视觉主题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI仍延续固有和矛盾性偏见，需推动伦理AI训练和包容性开发方法。

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces
deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how
concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study
investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express
ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these
representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through
iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across
four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes
within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our
findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old
white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical
biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups
inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes
onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite
supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional
physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.
These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal
representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and
paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical
AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法计算成本高，需要一种更高效且准确的方法来模拟碎裂过程。

Method: 使用神经网络直接映射输入参数到概率密度函数，避免数值求解控制方程。

Result: 在合成数据上验证了方法的计算效率和预测可靠性，精度优于传统有限差分法。

Conclusion: 为碎裂的数据驱动逆向分析奠定了基础，并展示了框架在超出预设模型结构外的扩展潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an
integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The
proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability
density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby
significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient
evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining
accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference
schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's
computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a
foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests
the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model
structures.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效、可扩展的多模态检索方法，结合混合搜索和重排序技术，解决了传统信息提取和MLLM的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息提取系统忽视视觉元素，而MLLM面临检索效率低的问题，需要一种高效的多模态检索方案。

Method: 采用混合搜索（元数据与嵌入）和先进的交互重排序技术，结合MLLM生成答案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在速度和稳定性上表现优异，适合企业生产系统。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态问答任务中高效且可扩展，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only
language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of
information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex
information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle
in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial
number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual
language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based
vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based
multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do
not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires
computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.
Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the
approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval
process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval
process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We
propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search
(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to
retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate
answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we
observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable
(without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production
systems at enterprises.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将稀疏自编码器（SAE）应用于序列推荐任务中的Transformer模型，以提高模型的可解释性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的序列推荐模型是黑盒模型，难以解释其内部行为。稀疏自编码器（SAE）在语言模型中已证明能提取可解释特征，因此研究其在序列推荐领域的应用具有重要意义。

Method: 将稀疏自编码器（SAE）应用于序列推荐任务中的Transformer模型，通过稀疏线性组合重构隐藏状态，提取可解释的特征方向。

Result: SAE提取的特征方向比原始隐藏状态维度更具可解释性和单义性，并能灵活控制模型行为，适应不同推荐场景。

Conclusion: SAE在序列推荐任务中表现出色，为模型的可解释性和可控性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based
on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box
models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their
internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is
very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse
autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for
extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders
learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from
sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential
recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied
to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned
directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original
hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by
SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior,
providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their
recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在个性化推荐中可能引发过滤气泡，限制用户视野、阻碍内容创作者发展并影响社会多样性。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过定义多样性性能指标，并将其纳入推荐系统的评估框架，调整系统以实现公平性。

Result: 优化后的推荐系统能在个性化推荐与促进社会多样性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 通过引入多样性指标，推荐系统可以避免过滤气泡，实现更公平和多样化的内容推荐。

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday
experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries
online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of
building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social
media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several
perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the
content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating
the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern
across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes
place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so
tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of
opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's
perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's
perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of
potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are
far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political
decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation
of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?
Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to
represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through
the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation
framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and
the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of
view.

Motivation: 探索自然被动体验下大脑如何支持空间表征，填补对大规模神经动力学理解的空白。

Method: 使用EEG-BCI解码被试在观看视频时的6D姿态（位置和方向），分析视觉输入对解码性能的影响。

Result: 视觉输入的结构化运动能可靠解码空间表征，100ms帧率下解码性能最佳，揭示分布式神经编码机制。

Conclusion: 大脑空间系统在被动条件下仍自发运作，挑战了主动与被动空间认知的传统区分，为非侵入式研究提供新途径。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for
self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal
neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale
neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during
naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,
fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and
orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited
spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent
visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable
spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of
spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is
presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with
intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation
through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing
to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed
yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the
brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under
passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and
passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the
automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding
of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured
internal representations.

TL;DR: JSQA框架通过感知引导的对比预训练和微调，显著提升了语音质量评估的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOS标签的高方差性导致传统方法难以准确评估语音质量，需要引入感知因素改进。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于JND对的感知对比预训练音频编码器；2）微调用于MOS预测。

Result: 实验表明，感知对比预训练显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 将感知因素融入预训练对语音质量评估的性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a
high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score
(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging
for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent
variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions
have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual
factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead
to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework
that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning
on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS
prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are
then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity
information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean
LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at
different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with
audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results
suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly
improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared
against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These
findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly
contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Conclusion: 论文强调了ORAN与NTN结合的未来研究方向，包括与其他技术的融合及潜在用例，为6G网络的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications
have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient,
reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures,
the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have
received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the
deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves
the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN
present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,
hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native
artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in
disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works
propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN
deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a
holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps
lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses
the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first
provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the
state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges
that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based
NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These
include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent
controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment
architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research
directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other
enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are
highlighted.

Result: 在小型合成工作负载中，Clarify成功消除模糊性并合成路由策略。

Conclusion: Clarify的方法适用于LLM能正确合成意图但集成模糊的场景，具有普适性。

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is
ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking
context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and
ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative
priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.
Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,
showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,
which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps
elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally
synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our
treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates
can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and
can lead to different global behaviors.

TL;DR: CompressedVQA-HDR是一个针对HDR视频质量评估的VQA框架，采用Swin Transformer和SigLip 2作为骨干网络，分别用于全参考和无参考模型，通过预训练和微调策略在多个数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法对HDR视频的泛化能力不足，需要一种更通用的评估方法。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer和SigLip 2分别构建FR和NR模型，通过预训练和微调策略优化性能。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现最优，CompressedVQA-HDR-FR在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中获胜。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR为HDR视频质量评估提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Result: 生成的CT图像在空间对齐和图像质量上显著提升，尤其是骨结构和软组织对比度的表现。

Conclusion: 3D-WLDM为MR-to-CT合成提供了一种高效解决方案，有望推动临床应用的进一步发展。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新生儿肺动脉高压（PH）的诊断依赖于超声心动图，但其准确性受操作者主观性影响。现有自动化方法多针对成人且依赖单视角图像，限制了在新生儿中的应用。

Method: 采用多视角变分自编码器（VAE）框架，从超声心动图视频中提取复杂潜在特征，并与单视角和监督学习方法进行比较。

Result: 结果显示，多视角学习方法在泛化能力和分类准确性上优于单视角和监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习为新生儿PH的稳健评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

Motivation: 探索基础模型在复杂、可变形解剖结构（如乳腺MRI）中的配准能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估了五种预训练编码器（DINO-v2、SAM、MedSAM、SSLSAM、MedCLIP）在四种乳腺配准任务中的表现。

Result: SAM等基础模型在整体配准上表现优异，但对纤维腺体组织的细节捕捉不足；医学特定预训练未提升性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究领域特定训练对配准的影响，并开发提升全局对齐与细节准确性的策略。

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration
performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to
understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore
targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure
accuracy. We also publicly release our code at
\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and

Result: 在乳腺组织分割任务中，UTS优于U-Net变体和基于变换器的基线方法。

Conclusion: UTS为临床相关任务（如肿瘤-间质定量和手术边缘评估）提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology
that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the
segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this
approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits
the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology
and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three
categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports
clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical
margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it
outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset

Method: 比较传统ML模型（如线性回归、随机森林等）与SurgeryLSTM（带注意力机制的BiLSTM），使用电子健康记录数据评估性能。

Result: SurgeryLSTM预测准确率最高（R2=0.86），注意力机制动态识别关键时间片段，提升解释性。关键预测因素包括骨病、慢性肾病等。

Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM为脊柱手术LOS预测提供了高准确性和可解释性，支持将其整合到临床决策系统中。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for
predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the
benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and
Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random
forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,
SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an
attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.
Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key
predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved
the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)
and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by
dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative
clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most
contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone
disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most
impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention
mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential
nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher
accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical
adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based
temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM
presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in
elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,
explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance
discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe
deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in
high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the
norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework
that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,
distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with
split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves
spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or
custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow
operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.
Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,
elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO
consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with
strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a
general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking
real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and
safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal
computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,
generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular
time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.
They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational
social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and
seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant
challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena
using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional
tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders
that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings
support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,
similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised
classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray
astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and
spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our
framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing
complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test
accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in
training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including
variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity
measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of
neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout
Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the
dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The
variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training
checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally,
the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the
embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that
correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries.
These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and
behaviour of grokking.

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail
industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions
are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being
treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the
timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network
operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures.
However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable
limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to
devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and
the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable
insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth
leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data
demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of
leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which
improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for
the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the
improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link
prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples
being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models
(GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this,
GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge
this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1)
structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training
between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment
between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert
knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are
conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's
performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the
effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is

Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various
hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of
delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local
forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in
handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.
These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally
expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In
contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance
prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through
globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load
forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of
different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore
feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how
globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In
addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its
potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the
balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series
clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming
models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.
Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity
load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently
outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global
features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming
models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring
TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中广泛应用，但仍面临初始化策略优化和过参数化问题。

Method: 将固定秩的LoRA矩阵视为光滑流形上的元素，利用流形上的最快损失下降方向进行初始化，并结合数值线性代数和黎曼优化实现稳定高效的计算。

Result: 实验表明，RiemannLoRA在收敛速度和最终性能上优于标准LoRA及其先进改进版本。

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA为LoRA的优化提供了统一框架，显著提升了效率与性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

TL;DR: 该研究使用XGBoost分类器结合拓扑特征预测荷兰铁路网络延误，填补了现有研究的空白，但结果表现有限，需进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰铁路网络是全球最繁忙的之一，延误问题严重。现有研究多关注短期预测，忽视了网络范围的模式，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用XGBoost分类器，结合节点中心性度量，并与多种分类器（如随机森林、决策树等）进行比较，预测延误轨迹。

Result: 结果显示性能有限，尤其在非同步测试场景中，表明需要更多针对具体情境的优化。

Conclusion: 研究为交通网络评估提供了新视角，并提出了未来开发更鲁棒预测模型的方向。

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays
being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This
research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway
network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological
features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and
neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple
effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,
originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air
network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node
Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,
DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is
to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited
performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the
necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research
contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and
proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for
delays.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Motivation: 现有元学习方法依赖干净标签数据集，但实践中难以获取，因此需要一种不依赖干净标签的噪声标签学习方法。

Method: 提出CLID-MU策略，利用干净样本在隐藏层和输出层间数据结构的连续性，通过跨层信息差异评估模型性能并指导训练。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签的基准数据集上，CLID-MU优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLID-MU为噪声标签学习提供了一种有效且无需干净标签的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural
networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by
using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this
approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,
which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the
challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean
labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the
need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively
preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and
the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the
Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).
CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature
spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.
Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both
synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准数据集（如MNIST）对特定领域任务不适用，而创建自定义数据集又耗时且复杂。

Method: 结合CLIP语义理解、强化学习和人类反馈，采用分层语义分类和模块化设计。

Result: 生成的两个新数据集（Tree-MNIST和Food-MNIST）实现了85%的自动分类准确率和80%的时间节省。

Conclusion: MNIST-Gen为特定任务提供了高效、灵活的数据集生成方案。

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited
to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on
domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other
real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant.
Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming,
legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present
MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating
MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using
hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic
understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve
intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical
approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics,
enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes:
individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large
datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category
theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable
morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and
\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing
task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization
accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Motivation: GPU内核编写对AI系统效率至关重要，但具有挑战性且需要迭代优化。强化学习因其可验证的奖励（如正确性和加速）成为自然选择。

Method: 开发了一种灵活的多轮RL方法，解决了长轨迹学习和跨轮奖励分配等现实挑战。

Result: Kevin在生成内核的正确性（从56%提升至82%）和平均加速（从0.53x提升至1.10x）上显著优于基础模型和前沿模型。

Conclusion: 多轮RL在CUDA内核优化中表现出色，串行细化比并行采样更有效，更多细化轮次带来更高改进率。

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems'
efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve
performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable
rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of
this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that
addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as
learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns.
We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL
for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin
shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of
generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to
1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini
(0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found
scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In
particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of
improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将剪枝技术应用于RL，显著提升了网络效率，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used
but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased
computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have
successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Motivation: 现有图欺诈检测方法忽略原始文本信息，且难以融合LLM处理的文本嵌入与图结构。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，MLED表现最优，可作为通用框架应用于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLED通过多级LLM增强，显著提升图欺诈检测能力。

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within
multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use
preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal
fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual
information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful
capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant
challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with
graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM
\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In
MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to
enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure
information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a
multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and
relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the
fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of
the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world
datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud
detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在自动调制识别中表现优异，但需要大量标注数据，而实际场景中目标域数据稀缺且标注成本高。数据增强方法无法从根本上解决问题。

Method: DUSE框架利用不确定性评分函数从相关数据集中筛选有用样本，并通过主动学习策略不断优化评分器。

Result: 实验表明，DUSE在类别平衡和不平衡设置下均优于8种核心集选择基线方法，并展现出对未见模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUSE为数据稀缺问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field
of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large
amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the
available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model
training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert
annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common
method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a
certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot
fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges,
we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven
Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring
function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an
active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection
baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE
exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Conclusion: PRISM为资源受限环境提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range
of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but
pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing
interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing
foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a
communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer
inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation
to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究核心集选择方法在减少训练数据量的同时，是否会影响模型对因果特征的学习，以及如何影响数据中的偏见。

Method: 通过十个不同的虚假相关性基准、五种样本重要性/难度评分指标和五种数据选择策略，全面分析核心集选择对偏见和模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 发现基于嵌入的样本评分方法比基于学习动态的方法更不易加剧偏见，且高难度样本优先选择未必能提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 核心集选择方法需谨慎设计，以避免无意中加剧偏见，且高难度样本优先策略不能可靠保证模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Result: 实验显示，TuneQn能减少高达54.14%的精度损失和72.9%的模型大小。

Conclusion: TuneQn有效解决了选择性量化问题，为模型优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network
models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of
accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance
below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware
accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,
quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but
selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose
TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of
ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and
multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX
models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics
like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best
model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings
across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility
effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model
candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the
fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the
original model.

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression
because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they
often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and
may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses
nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling
these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as
input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the
chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior
of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods
for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different
nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure.
Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily
modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on
several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and
log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated
with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only
nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover
the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

Result: 实验证明RegCL在多领域数据集上表现优异，验证了其动态场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: RegCL通过非重放持续学习框架，成功整合多领域知识，保持高效参数利用。

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（如Deepseek-R1）在Chain-of-Thought生成过程中易受安全威胁（如后门提示攻击），导致推理机制被破坏，亟需一种既能抵御攻击又能保持性能的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,
Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large
Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains
a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like
backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning
mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this
vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously
degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To
address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought
Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to
malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves
this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data
processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)
adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive
defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement
learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the
security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

### [221] [NOCTA: Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition for Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12412)
*Dzung Dinh,Boqi Chen,Marc Niethammer,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOCTA是一种非贪婪目标成本权衡获取方法，用于在资源受限的预测任务中动态选择最具信息量的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等关键应用中，资源限制使得获取信息的成本（时间、金钱、风险）成为重要考量，同时时序预测任务增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出NOCTA方法，包括非参数（NOCTA-NP）和参数（NOCTA-P）两种互补的估计器，动态选择特征。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上，NOCTA优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NOCTA能有效平衡信息获取成本和预测性能，适用于资源受限的时序预测任务。

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of
information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in
healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to
imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be
acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover,
temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over
time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is
important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff
Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at
inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition
cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,
and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based
on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric
method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).
Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both
NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态选择专家序列的混合专家架构（MoE），通过可变计算图提高预测精度，无需负载平衡机制，训练效率提升10%-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构通常需要固定计算量，限制了灵活性和效率。本文旨在设计一种动态选择专家序列的方法，以逐步提高预测精度。

Method: 采用类似RNN的训练方式，迭代采样候选专家序列，构建可变宽度和深度的计算图。

Result: 实验显示训练周期减少10%-40%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为MoE领域提供了新的研究方向，可能设计出更快、表达能力更强的模型。

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts
(MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing
computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures
generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our
approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the
computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by
iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence
akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require
load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in
training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These
results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the
design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available

TL;DR: 比较单模态与多模态方法在检测在线协同行为中的效果，发现多模态方法能更全面地理解协同动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态方法可能忽略多模态协同的复杂性，需探索多模态方法的优势。

Method: 比较弱整合与强整合多模态模型，评估不同数据模态的贡献。

Result: 多模态方法能更全面地捕捉协同行为，但并非所有模态都提供独特见解。

Conclusion: 多模态方法提升了在线协同行为的检测能力，为数字平台完整性提供新视角。

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions
to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key
focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on
monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets
or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other.
However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in
multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing
the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off
between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the
balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly
coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we
assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how
varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our
findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that
with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of
coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze
coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the
integrity of digital platforms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层协作的匝道合并控制框架（HCOMC），用于解决混合交通流中的匝道合并问题，结合了纵向跟车和横向换道模型，并通过仿真验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路匝道合并区域是交通拥堵和事故的高发区，目前基于联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的协作控制策略是根本解决方案，但CAVs尚未普及，因此需要针对混合交通流提出解决方案。

Method: 扩展了基于智能驾驶员模型的纵向跟车模型和基于五次多项式曲线的横向换道模型，提出了HCOMC框架，包括分层协作规划模型、基于博弈论的可选换道模型和多目标优化模型。

Result: 仿真结果表明，HCOMC在提升车辆群安全性、稳定和加速合并过程、优化交通效率和节省燃油消耗方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: HCOMC框架为混合交通流中的匝道合并问题提供了有效的解决方案，尤其在CAVs普及率较低的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险交通区域（如交叉路口）是碰撞的主要原因，需提升自动驾驶车辆的安全性。

Method: 训练1000步去噪扩散概率模型生成碰撞传感器噪声序列，并通过生成对抗架构将其蒸馏为单步模型，用于快速推理。

Result: 单步模型在仿真实验中显著降低了失败率和延迟率，优于基线智能驾驶员模型控制器。

Conclusion: 单步去噪扩散模型能高效生成潜在碰撞场景，为自动驾驶车辆提供更鲁棒的规划决策。

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.

Conclusion: 新方法通过相似性匹配和局部优化，显著提升了单视角下未知物体抓取的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

Conclusion: 利用人类视频训练机器人策略是可行的，且能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对IIoT边缘计算环境的AIGC任务卸载框架，通过多智能体协作和MADDPG-MATO算法，显著降低了延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IIoT与AIGC结合为智能制造带来新机遇，但传统云计算方法难以满足实时需求，边缘计算虽能降低延迟，但动态任务和资源限制带来挑战。

Method: 提出AIGC任务卸载框架，首次考虑模型切换的延迟和能耗，采用多智能体协作和MADDPG-MATO算法优化任务卸载。

Result: 实验表明，MADDPG-MATO在延迟、能耗和任务完成率上均优于基线算法，平均降低延迟6.98%、能耗7.12%，任务完成率提高3.72%。

Conclusion: MADDPG-MATO算法在动态高负载的IIoT环境中表现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial
Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart
manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to
computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative
models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time
requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can
effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature
of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher
demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing
environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC
model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent
collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge
servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task
offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental
results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an
average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%
increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model
numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is
robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

TL;DR: PGT-I扩展了PyTorch Geometric Temporal，通过分布式数据并行训练和两种新策略（index-batching和distributed-index-batching），显著降低了内存开销，实现了大规模ST-GNN训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式训练框架对时空模型支持不足，且未充分利用时空数据特性，限制了ST-GNN在大规模数据集上的应用。

Method: 提出PGT-I，结合分布式数据并行训练和动态构建快照的索引技术（index-batching和distributed-index-batching）。

Result: 在PeMS数据集上首次实现无需图分区的ST-GNN训练，内存使用减少89%，速度提升13.1倍（128 GPU）。

Conclusion: PGT-I为大规模时空图神经网络训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for
modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications
have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory
constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks
lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of
spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we
present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch
Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two
novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index
techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically
at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while
distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable
processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training
of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing
peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over
standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

TL;DR: MetaLint是一个基于指令调优的框架，用于动态分析代码质量，解决了大型语言模型在代码质量分析中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成中表现优异，但在代码质量分析上受限于静态训练数据，难以适应不断变化的最佳实践。

Method: MetaLint通过指令调优合成数据，支持从易到难的泛化，无需重新训练即可适应新的代码模式。

Result: MetaLint在检测未见的PEP习语上表现优异，F-score达70.37%，召回率70.43%，定位准确率26.73%。

Conclusion: MetaLint展示了在代码质量分析中的潜力，尤其适用于动态适应新代码模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with
code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and
can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new
instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the
task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms
based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train
models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on
synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization,
enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining.
To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by
real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and
assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize.
Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms,
achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%)
among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization,
competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art
models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality
analysis.

Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering;
however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks,
overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over
executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true
capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address
this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,
specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in
Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming
languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that
outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these
tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct
MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming
environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We
evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in
terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly
releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in
model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动化方法，将静态HTML定价转换为智能定价（iPricing），以提高SaaS定价管理的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SaaS市场的快速扩张导致定价结构复杂化，DevOps团队手动管理效率低下且易出错，缺乏自动化工具限制了定价模型的优化和扩展。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的AI4Pricing2Yaml系统，结合网页抓取和LLM技术，从SaaS网站提取定价组件、计划、功能等关键信息。

Result: 在30个商业SaaS数据集上验证，系统能有效提取所需元素，但仍面临幻觉、复杂结构和动态内容的挑战。

Conclusion: 智能定价自动化有望提升SaaS定价管理的一致性和可扩展性，未来研究将优化提取能力和系统适应性。

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering
flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid
expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps
teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that
is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for
pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and
scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing
(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these
challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines
operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in
response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We
present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML
pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while
minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic
Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract
essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from
SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,
encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's
effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for
code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version
updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution
benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based
evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To
address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset
comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific
library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon
rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),
LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform
version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy
through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art
systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models
achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the
intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing
the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer
understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more
adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and
evaluation code publicly available at
https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.
