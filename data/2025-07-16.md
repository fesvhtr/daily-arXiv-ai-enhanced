### [1] [CWNet: Causal Wavelet Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10689)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Yubing Lu,Mengen Cai,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet提出了一种基于小波变换和因果推理的低光图像增强方法，通过全局和局部因果分析优化图像恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光图像增强方法忽视实例级语义信息和特征特性，CWNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合因果推理和小波变换，采用全局度量学习和局部CLIP语义损失，设计小波变换骨干网络。

Result: CWNet在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换实现了更精确的低光图像增强。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

### [2] [Integrating Biological Knowledge for Robust Microscopy Image Profiling on De Novo Cell Lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10737)
*Jiayuan Chen,Thai-Hoang Pham,Yuanlong Wang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合外部生物知识的新框架，用于增强显微镜图像分析模型，以解决细胞系异质性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量筛选技术在药物发现中至关重要，但由于细胞系的形态和生物学异质性，对新细胞系的稳健筛选仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过整合蛋白质相互作用数据和转录组特征，解耦扰动特异性和细胞系特异性表示。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了对新细胞系的显微镜图像分析能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于表型的药物发现提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

### [3] [Auditing Facial Emotion Recognition Datasets for Posed Expressions and Racial Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10755)
*Rina Khan,Catherine Stinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究审计了两个先进的FER数据集，发现其中许多图像是摆拍而非真实表情，且模型对非白人或深色皮肤人群存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FER算法在检测自发表情和不同种族肤色人群时的性能下降和伦理问题。

Method: 从数据集中随机抽样，区分自发与摆拍图像，并测试模型对不同肤色人群的预测表现。

Result: 发现数据集存在摆拍图像，且模型对非白人或深色皮肤人群有负面情绪预测偏见。

Conclusion: 数据集和模型的偏差可能导致实际应用中的危害，需改进数据收集和模型训练方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

### [4] [FPC-Net: Revisiting SuperPoint with Descriptor-Free Keypoint Detection via Feature Pyramids and Consistency-Based Implicit Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10770)
*Ionuţ Grigore,Călin-Adrian Popa,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需描述符的兴趣点匹配方法，显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖描述符匹配，计算和存储开销大。

Method: 在检测过程中直接关联兴趣点，避免描述符的使用。

Result: 匹配精度略低于传统方法，但内存占用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何计算机视觉任务提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的航天器图像分割数据集，用于训练和评估实时自主检测系统，解决了公开标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航天器在太空环境中易受损，人工或机器人维修成本高，需要可靠且经济的自主检测系统。

Method: 创建了包含64k标注图像的航天器数据集，结合真实和合成背景，并添加噪声和失真；微调YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型进行性能评估。

Result: 模型在实时约束下达到Dice分数0.92、Hausdorff距离0.69，推理时间约0.5秒。

Conclusion: 数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了可靠基准，支持太空自主检测系统的开发。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal
Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM
finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we
present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong
and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the
challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse
scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to
conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given
complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset demonstrate that
our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object
retrieval, counting, and distance estimation. The code is available at:

### [7] [ThinkingViT: Matryoshka Thinking Vision Transformer for Elastic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10800)
*Ali Hojjat,Janek Haberer,Soren Pirk,Olaf Landsiedel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkingViT是一种动态调整计算资源的嵌套ViT架构，通过渐进式推理阶段和Token Recycling机制提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有嵌套Transformer模型对所有输入分配相同计算资源导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 采用渐进式推理阶段和Token Recycling机制，动态调整注意力头的激活数量。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，ThinkingViT在相同吞吐量下准确率提升2.0 p.p.，相同计算量下提升2.9 p.p.。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT通过动态计算分配显著提升了效率和性能，可作为插件升级现有ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

### [8] [LLM-Guided Agentic Object Detection for Open-World Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10844)
*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），实现无需标签的零样本检测，通过动态生成场景特定对象名称并评估其定位和命名性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，扩展性差；现有开放世界和开放词汇检测方法（OWOD和OVOD）存在语义标签缺失或依赖用户提示的问题，缺乏自主性。

Method: 利用LLM生成场景特定对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器进行定位，提出CAAP和SNAP两个新指标分别评估定位和命名性能。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了检测和命名新对象的强大性能。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提升了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

### [9] [Winsor-CAM: Human-Tunable Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Layer-Wise Winsorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10846)
*Casey Wall,Longwei Wang,Rodrigue Rizk,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winsor-CAM是Grad-CAM的扩展，通过跨层聚合信息和Winsorization技术生成更鲁棒和连贯的显著性图，提升了模型解释性和定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域部署CNN时，理解其决策过程至关重要。Grad-CAM等方法可能掩盖语义线索或放大噪声，需要更鲁棒的解释方法。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，结合Winsorization技术衰减异常值，并通过用户可调阈值实现语义级控制，跨层聚合信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM生成的显著性图更易解释，定位性能优于Grad-CAM和均匀层平均基线。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过多层分析和人机交互控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

### [10] [Sparse Fine-Tuning of Transformers for Generative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10855)
*Wei Chen,Jingxi Yu,Zichen Miao,Qiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏编码的微调框架，通过稀疏组合特征字典原子来改进模型对下游任务的适应性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法难以解释参数更新的贡献和模型如何适应新任务，因此需要一种更透明的方法。

Method: 提出稀疏编码启发的微调框架，将微调特征表示为特征字典原子的稀疏组合，稀疏系数指示原子重要性。

Result: 方法在图像编辑和文本到图像概念定制任务中表现优异，优于基线微调方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏编码框架提升了模型的可解释性和任务适应能力，为微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Lennart Svensson,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trexplorer Super是一种改进的3D医学图像中心线追踪模型，解决了重复分支和提前终止问题，并在新开发的数据集上表现优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确追踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）对医学任务至关重要，但现有模型存在重复分支和提前终止问题，且缺乏公开数据集进行评估。

Method: 提出Trexplorer Super模型，通过新方法改进性能，并开发了三个难度递增的中心线数据集（一个合成，两个真实）用于评估。

Result: Trexplorer Super在所有数据集上优于现有技术，但合成数据上的强表现不一定适用于真实数据。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super显著提升了中心线追踪性能，同时强调了真实数据评估的重要性。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/RomStriker/Trexplorer-Super.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CNN的轻量级全球天气预报模型KAI-a，其性能与现有Transformer模型相当，但计算需求显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI天气预报模型依赖Transformer架构，计算复杂度高，资源需求大。本研究旨在开发一种更高效的CNN模型。

Method: 采用尺度不变架构和InceptionNeXt模块，结合地球系统数据特点设计模型，训练于ERA5数据集。

Result: KAI-a在中等范围天气预报中表现优异，参数仅700万，训练时间12小时，且能捕捉极端天气事件。

Conclusion: KAI-a证明了CNN模型在天气预报中的高效性和实用性，为轻量级AI天气预报提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

### [14] [Commuting Distance Regularization for Timescale-Dependent Label Inconsistency in EEG Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10895)
*Xiaocong Zeng,Craig Michoski,Yan Pang,Dongyang Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的正则化策略（LVL和LGCL）解决EEG情感识别中的时间尺度标签不一致问题，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度标签不一致（TsDLI）问题，提升模型泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 提出局部变化损失（LVL）和局部-全局一致性损失（LGCL），结合数学原理和图论框架，并引入新评估指标。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上，LVL和LGCL优于现有方法，LVL表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在标签不一致情况下平衡了可解释性和预测能力，效果显著。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled

TL;DR: GeoDistill提出了一种几何引导的弱监督自蒸馏框架，通过教师-学生学习和基于视场的掩码增强局部特征学习，用于鲁棒的跨视图定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完全监督学习，需要昂贵的真实姿态标注，GeoDistill旨在通过弱监督减少标注成本。

Method: 使用教师模型定位全景图像，学生模型从有限视场图像预测位置，通过对齐预测结果增强特征学习。

Result: 实验表明GeoDistill显著提升了定位性能，并减少了不确定性。

Conclusion: GeoDistill为跨视图定位提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAPL-SCD的图聚合原型学习方法，用于解决语义变化检测中的多任务优化问题，通过自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易因任务间冲突导致负迁移，影响性能。

Method: 设计了多任务联合优化框架，结合语义分割、变化检测和图聚合原型学习，采用自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法。

Result: 在SECOND和Landsat-SCD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD通过多任务优化和特征交互模块，有效解决了SCD中的任务冲突问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

Motivation: 当前人脸修复技术虽在视觉质量上有显著提升，但身份模糊问题仍未解决，RIDFR旨在通过特定身份修复框架解决这一问题。

Method: RIDFR结合预训练扩散模型与两个并行条件模块（内容注入和身份注入），并引入对齐学习以抑制与身份无关的语义干扰。

Result: 实验表明，RIDFR在身份保真度和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，能重建高质量的身份特定结果。

Conclusion: RIDFR通过创新的框架设计有效解决了身份模糊问题，为人脸修复领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保持完整步态性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

TL;DR: SpaRTAN是一种轻量级架构设计，通过多尺度空间特征和通道聚合模块提升性能，显著减少参数冗余，在ImageNet和COCO上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代CNN和Transformer存在简单性偏好和通道冗余问题，限制了复杂特征的表达能力。

Method: 提出SpaRTAN，结合多尺度空间核和波式通道聚合模块，动态整合特征。

Result: ImageNet-1k上77.7%准确率（3.8M参数），COCO上50.0% AP（21.5M参数），性能领先。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计解决了冗余问题，实现了高性能与低参数的平衡。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 零样本异常检测在应用中需求广泛，但现有方法存在噪声和模糊性问题，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批次内图像作为参考，通过文本信息过滤噪声，并恢复CLIP的局部语义相关性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等基准测试中，FiSeCLIP在异常分类和分割任务上表现优于现有方法，如AU-ROC和F1-max分别提升4.6%和5.7%。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为零样本异常检测提供了更强基线，展示了CLIP在细粒度任务中的潜力。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

Conclusion: SISRNet有效缓解数据偏差，生成更准确的临床报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Result: 在临床数据集上，方法在RMSE、SSIM、LPIPS和Dice指标上表现优异，仅需10步采样。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且有效，适用于实时、偏好对齐的医学图像转换。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

Method: 采用文本提示调优插件方法，结合负掩码提案和视觉嵌入注入，减少错误预测并丰富文本提示表示。

Result: 在新建立的基准测试（FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$、ADE$^\text{per}$）上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在个性化OVSS任务中表现优异，且不影响原始OVSS性能。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域协同和物理引导，显著提升了去雾效果和效率，适用于复杂户外场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

Conclusion: ProLearn有效减少文本依赖，扩展了语言引导分割的适用性。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

TL;DR: RoMaP是一种新的局部3D高斯编辑框架，通过3D-GALP和正则化SDS损失实现精确的局部编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D神经表示和实例级编辑模型在实现精确局部3D编辑时面临挑战，尤其是高斯泼溅技术因多视角2D分割不一致和SDS损失的模糊性而受限。

Method: 提出3D-GALP模块生成鲁棒的3D掩码，并结合正则化SDS损失（包括L1锚定损失和高斯先验去除等）实现局部编辑。

Result: 实验表明，RoMaP在重建和生成的高斯场景中实现了最先进的局部3D编辑效果。

Conclusion: RoMaP为3D高斯编辑提供了更鲁棒和灵活的局部编辑能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关节角度建模的新方法，用于改进无标记人体姿态估计（HPE），解决了关键点识别错误和轨迹波动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HPE方法在关键点识别和轨迹分析中存在误差，且训练数据集标注不准确限制了深度学习模型的性能。

Method: 1. 基于关节角度的人体姿态建模；2. 通过高阶傅里叶级数近似关节角度变化；3. 设计双向循环网络作为后处理模块。

Result: JAR方法在花样滑冰和霹雳舞等挑战性场景中表现优于现有HPE细化网络。

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的细化方法显著提升了HPE的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Result: 实验表明GKNet在精度和有效性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GKNet和SKD数据集为非合作航天器的姿态估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at

Method: 构建了高质量的3D GPR数据集，并提出基于YOLO模型的交叉验证策略。

Result: 在实地测试中，召回率超过98.6%，检测系统可减少约90%的人工工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为RSD自动识别提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助输入和简化物理近似，缺乏标准化3D基准，可能引入不确定性且未能充分捕捉真实大气效应。

Method: 结合WRF和增强的COSP模拟器生成3D散射数据，构建Atmos-Bench数据集；提出FourCastX模型，嵌入物理约束以提升恢复质量。

Result: 在355 nm和532 nm波段上均优于现有基线模型，且无需辅助输入。

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于更深入的气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves
the way for deeper climate insight.

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the
interpretability of visual recognition models.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Jellyfish, a diverse group of gelatinous marine organisms, play a crucial
role in maintaining marine ecosystems but pose significant challenges for
biodiversity and conservation due to their rapid proliferation and ecological
impact. Accurate identification of jellyfish species is essential for
ecological monitoring and management. In this study, we proposed a deep

combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three

Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish
species using the convolutional neural network models. The combination of the
Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model,
achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other
feature extractor-classifier combinations. This study demonstrates the efficacy
of deep learning and hybrid frameworks in addressing biodiversity challenges
and advancing species detection in marine environments.

Motivation: 硬样本在CC-ReID任务中具有挑战性，其模糊性和缺乏明确定义限制了学习策略的设计和模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HSGL展示了多模态引导的硬样本生成与学习在CC-ReID中的潜力，有效提升了模型的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决了多模态场景表示中的模态冲突问题，实现了更高效和紧凑的多模态表示。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,
Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our
proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural
image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their
competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation
protocols.

limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

Motivation: 当前长视频生成模型缺乏专门的评估基准，现有基准仅支持简单叙事提示，无法准确评估叙事丰富性。

Method: 1. 引入TNA作为基本叙事单元；2. 设计自动提示生成管道；3. 基于MLLM框架设计评估指标。

Conclusion: NarrLV为长视频生成模型的叙事能力评估提供了有效工具，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Conclusion: 该方法能更细致地揭示歧视模式，适用于工业部署，为连续敏感属性的公平性评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Conclusion: ViewSRD通过结构化多视角分解有效解决了3D视觉定位中的关键挑战。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Conclusion: YOLOatr在复杂环境下表现出色，为热红外目标识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616

annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a
cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for
classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation.
Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial

estimation of their area. The state-of-the-art computer vision model YOLOv11,
adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk

Motivation: 现有GS方法仅使用单一类型的基元（高斯椭圆或椭球）表示复杂多样的物体表面，不足以实现高质量重建。

Result: 实验证明该框架在表面重建中表现优异。

Conclusion: 多基元GS框架显著提升了表面重建的准确性和质量。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Motivation: 现有MVS方法在纹理缺失和反射区域表现不佳，而单目深度估计在这些区域更鲁棒，因此提出结合两者的方法。

Method: 通过注意力机制整合单目特征，动态更新深度候选，并设计相对一致性损失监督深度预测。

Result: 在DTU和Tanks-and-Temples数据集上达到最优性能，排名第一。

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet成功结合单目与多视角信息，显著提升了深度预测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Motivation: 高分辨率大视场图像的压缩需求增加，传统方法难以保留细节，数据驱动方法泛化性差，INRs虽具潜力但压缩速度慢且压缩比不足。

Method: 提出COLI框架，结合NeRV技术，采用预训练-微调、混合精度训练和并行化目标加速压缩，并引入超压缩技术提升压缩比。

Result: 在两个医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，显著降低比特率，同时将NeRV训练速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: COLI框架有效解决了大图像压缩问题，在压缩速度和压缩比上取得显著改进。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Method: 结合NURBS参数化和分层扩散模型，生成中心线和径向轮廓，实现血管几何的合成。

Result: 生成的主动脉几何与原始数据集高度一致，支持零样本条件生成，适用于多种实际应用。

Conclusion: HUG-VAS首次将图像先验与生成形状建模统一结合，为心血管诊断和治疗提供了新工具。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在退化成像条件下鲁棒圆检测和拟合的基本计算机视觉挑战。

Method: 结合高效的组合边缘像素采样和卷积参数空间密度估计。

Result: 在真实医学数据和合成数据中表现优异，Jaccard指数达0.896，实时性能40.3 fps，优于RCD等方法。

Conclusion: 3C-FBI在准确性、速度和鲁棒性方面表现出色，适用于医疗影像、机器人和工业检测。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人类感知的模糊颜色模型COLIBRI，通过模糊集合和逻辑构建颜色分类框架，实验验证其与传统颜色模型相比更符合人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机难以模仿人类颜色感知，需要一种更贴近人类视觉感知的计算颜色表示方法。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：初步实验确定可区分颜色刺激，大规模人类分类调查提取模糊分区，生成反映感知不确定性的隶属函数。

Result: 模型在人类感知对齐上优于传统颜色模型（如RGB、HSV、LAB），并支持基于反馈的适应性调整。

Conclusion: COLIBRI模型在设计和人机交互等领域具有重要应用价值，填补了大规模人类感知数据建模的空白。

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号解码视觉表示具有挑战性，因其复杂且噪声多，需要一种新方法来提高解码质量和图像生成效果。

Method: 5阶段框架：EEG编码器分类概念、跨模态对齐EEG和文本嵌入、重新排序优化标题、加权插值嵌入、预训练Stable Diffusion模型生成图像。

Result: 生成高质量图像，分类准确率提升13.43%，生成准确率提升15.21%，Fr\'echet Inception Distance降低36.61%。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义对齐和图像质量上优于现有技术，为EEG信号解码视觉表示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic
alignment and image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成一致内容时，无法保持背景细节一致性，且在大运动变化时身份和服装细节不一致。

Method: 采用点跟踪注意力和自适应令牌合并技术，结合前景与背景解耦控制。

Result: CharaConsist能实现细粒度一致性，支持固定场景或不同场景中的连续或离散镜头生成。

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的文本到图像一致性生成方法，扩展了实际应用范围。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Result: 在多个4D几何感知基准测试中表现出色，推理速度快且性能竞争性强。

Conclusion: 为可扩展和交互式4D视觉系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Result: 提出了深度基础模型的概念，总结了关键架构和训练策略，并提供了大规模数据集的概述。

Conclusion: 深度基础模型有望解决现有挑战，未来研究应关注其鲁棒性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

TL;DR: SAMEP是一种新型框架，支持AI代理之间持久、安全且可语义搜索的记忆共享，解决了记忆短暂性、安全协作和语义发现等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理架构存在记忆短暂性问题，限制了跨会话和代理边界的协作与知识共享。

Method: SAMEP采用分布式记忆存储库，结合向量语义搜索、加密访问控制和标准化API，支持持久上下文保存、安全协作和语义发现。

Result: 实验显示，SAMEP减少了73%的冗余计算，提升了89%的上下文相关性，并完全符合法规要求。

Conclusion: SAMEP为持久协作的AI代理生态系统提供了新范式，同时保障安全与隐私。

Abstract: Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations,
preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and
agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a
novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable
memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical
challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2)
secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3)
efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a
distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic
access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing
agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness
across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare
AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental
results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in
context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements
including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent,
collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy
guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过引入归纳偏置促进多智能体强化学习中的通信，但研究质疑这是否过度工程化，探索内生符号系统的自然通信能力。

Method: 采用VQ-VAE构建"AI Mother Tongue"框架，研究代理在拥有内生符号系统时的语义压缩与收敛行为。

Result: 实验表明内生符号系统能自发实现语义压缩与纳什均衡驱动的语义收敛，且通信效率优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究为连接主义与符号主义提供了新思路，未来将探索HQ-VAE增强表达能力和RL低层预训练的潜力。

Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development
of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration
Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' .
Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate
communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such
artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments
with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized
Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an
endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit
spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic
convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external
inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that
the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and
resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM
demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis
toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a
significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical
insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First
Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research
will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders
(HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the
potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This
discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

Conclusion: 该框架将感知与元推理分离，具有可扩展性和可解释性，适用于诊断、生物学等信任关键领域，代码已开源。

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent
architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing
challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot
settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual
classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a
non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three
configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)
fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated
orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.
Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator
modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy
improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,
achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL
displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with
visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via
iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision
agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable
multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other
trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components
including the complete software source code are openly released to support
reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github:

Motivation: 揭示LLMs在任务失败中的结构性原因，探讨其能力边界。

Method: 通过控制实验和架构分析，研究LLMs在原则表达与应用之间的差距。

Result: 发现LLMs缺乏组合推理的架构支持，行为脆弱且受限于模式完成。

Conclusion: 未来模型需引入元认知控制和结构化执行，当前LLMs能力有限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet
systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy,
and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such
failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and
\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,
we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably
applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational
execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain
syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and
functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from
mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model
behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs
function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural
scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the
boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with
metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.
This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may
reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal
computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction
and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and
mechanistic analysis.

Motivation: 探索LLM通过API调用在知识密集型领域（如气象学）中有效利用工具的潜力，解决现有系统在领域知识访问和复杂查询处理上的不足。

Method: 集成知识图谱、LLM、ReAct代理和工具使用技术，通过虚拟API评估API调用准确性（名称识别失败、幻觉失败、调用正确性）。

Result: KG2data在名称识别失败（1.43%）、幻觉失败（0%）、调用正确性（88.57%）上表现优于RAG2data和chat2data。

Conclusion: KG2data通过知识图谱增强内容检索和复杂查询处理，为高知识需求领域提供智能问答和数据分析的新方案。

Abstract: API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for
data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API
calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology.
This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs,
ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition
and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we
evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure,
hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior
performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and
chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based
systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which
hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a
knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval,
complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship
resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost
of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain
knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for
intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains
with high knowledge demands.

Conclusion: 新协议虽重要，但不足以构建一个稳健、开放、可信的生态系统。未来研究应聚焦于解决去中心化身份、经济模型、安全和治理等社会技术挑战。

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,
document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'
behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become
more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across
different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered
frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation
obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic
understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive
evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and
the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations
of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To
systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic
foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery
mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing
agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent
where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift
in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic
Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model
(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable
and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new
protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,
trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies
in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda
focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance
for the emerging WoA.

Motivation: 探索如何通过变异语法结构而非直接修改曲调来生成新音乐，并研究多次变异对曲调的影响。

Method: 使用Sequitur算法解析曲调生成语法结构（Pathway Assembly），随机应用19种变异类型（如添加、删除、交换等），再扩展语法生成新曲调。

Result: 通过编辑距离、结构复杂度和曲调长度等指标分析变异效果，并评估每种变异类型的影响大小。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成与原曲调相关的新曲调，但仅关注音高序列生成，未涉及其他音乐元素。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by
varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [
1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur
algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out
mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially
19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of
the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the
mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar.
Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune.
The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original
tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple
mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are
used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the
size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review
the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI对数据中心能源消耗和温室气体排放的影响，分析了短期（2030年前）和长期（2035年后）的情景，并讨论了AI在减排方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的广泛应用，数据中心的能源消耗和碳排放问题日益突出。本文旨在评估AI对环境的净影响，并探讨其在优化能源使用和减排方面的潜力。

Method: 通过分析数据中心的能源消耗情景和AI技术的应用趋势，结合短期和长期的预测，评估AI对碳排放的影响。

Result: 短期内，AI的普及可能导致能源消耗和碳排放增加；但长期来看，AI通过优化能源生产和供应链，有望显著减少碳排放。

Conclusion: 尽管AI在短期内可能增加碳排放，但其长期潜力在于支持气候缓解，最终可能实现净减排。

Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources,
and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked
significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with
the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and
AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy
consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering
both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and
beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net
positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,
we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive
workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and
consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely
strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and
therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of
big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and
complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and
applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more
promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its
ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from
energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon
footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial
emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where
traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some
initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support
climate mitigation efforts.

Motivation: IoT系统流量模式具有时序性和多样性，为模型学习提供了丰富的数据，需高效检测恶意攻击。

Method: 采用GraphSAGE、BERT、TCN、Multi-Head Attention、BI-LSTM等模型，分析其性能。

Result: BERT表现最优，准确率99.94%；Multi-Head Attention检测能力强但耗时；GraphSAGE训练最快但性能较低。

Conclusion: BERT在捕获时序依赖上表现最佳，适合IoT恶意攻击检测；其他模型各有优劣，可根据需求选择。

Abstract: This paper intends to detect IoT malicious attacks through deep learning
models and demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning and
graph-based models regarding malicious network traffic detection. The models
particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head
Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM)
Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models
demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature
significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT
system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of
temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that
BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate
alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which
demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The
Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection
capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head
Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The
GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training
time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the
other models

Result: 实验表明，适当预处理后，常见模型能有效分类抽象数据，时空编码显著提升检测性能。

Conclusion: 预处理和时空编码是检测AI辅助的关键，为其他抽象任务的通用性提供了思路。

Abstract: Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important
as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical
diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans,
especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel
at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process
large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting
help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in
this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes,
such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data
that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can
effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so,
we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along
with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the
exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other
abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three
classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN
architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing
performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial
quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.

TL;DR: SigmaScheduling动态调整决策点，提高移动健康干预的及时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定间隔的决策点调度方法对习惯性行为干预效果不佳，尤其是对作息不规律的用户。

Method: 提出SigmaScheduling方法，根据行为时间预测的不确定性动态调整决策点。

Result: 在68名参与者的试验中，SigmaScheduling在70%以上的情况下确保决策点发生在刷牙行为之前。

Conclusion: SigmaScheduling能提升精准移动健康干预的效果，适用于时间敏感的习惯性行为。

Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health
(mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points,"
intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions
(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey
data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting
habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on
delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.
Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)
before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same
for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly
for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after
the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.
In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule
decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior
timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to
the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling
schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely
intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68
participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily
toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points
preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to
intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can
advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive,
habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic
analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We
evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic
analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting
Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and
validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five
LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary
classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing
zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,
GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:
0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely
mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:
16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based
approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for

Conclusion: AF-XRAY支持目的论法律推理，帮助用户识别模糊性原因并探索替代解决方案。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning,
but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains
challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for
exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY
introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length
revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack
edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay
visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded
semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension
resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack
sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling
users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative
resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by
Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by
revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

TL;DR: NavComposer是一个自动生成高质量导航指令的框架，通过分解和重组语义实体来提升指令的丰富性和准确性。NavInstrCritic则是一个无需标注的评估系统，从三个维度评估指令质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专家提供的导航指令数量有限，而合成的指令质量不足，限制了大规模研究。

Method: NavComposer分解语义实体（动作、场景、物体）并重组为自然语言指令；NavInstrCritic通过对比匹配、语义一致性和语言多样性评估指令。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，支持大规模和通用化研究。

Conclusion: NavComposer和NavInstrCritic解决了指令生成和评估的瓶颈，推动了导航研究的可扩展性。

Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents
to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However,
expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决多病共存患者治疗推荐中的治疗冲突问题，并克服现有决策支持系统的可扩展性限制。

Method: 设计单代理和多代理框架，模拟MDT决策过程，通过LLM代理间的讨论解决医疗冲突，并在基准案例上评估系统性能。

Result: 当前LLM下，单代理GP表现与MDT相当，最佳模型能提供满足临床目标的正确建议，但存在建议不完整和药物冲突问题。

Conclusion: LLM-based MAS在多病共存患者治疗推荐中具有潜力，但仍需改进建议完整性和减少药物冲突。

Abstract: Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is
challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support
systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general
practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening
multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the
feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent
system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and
a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM
agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy
planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared
MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An
important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics
that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of
clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold
standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP
performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct
recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are
incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in
unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug
interactions.

Result: KPO有效降低有害序列生成概率，同时保持高功能性。

Conclusion: KPO为生物技术中的生成模型提供了安全保证框架。

Abstract: Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence
generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and
denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of
generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral
transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical
biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior
knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an
efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs
reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins.
Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of
producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a
robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in
biotechnology.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且可靠，有助于理解鸟类迁徙。

Abstract: Due to climate-induced changes, many habitats are experiencing range shifts
away from their traditional geographic locations (Piguet, 2011). We propose a
solution to accurately model whether bird species are present in a specific
habitat through the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
(O'Shea, 2015) and tabular data. Our approach makes use of satellite imagery
and environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, elevation) to
predict bird presence across various climates. The CNN model captures spatial
characteristics of landscapes such as forestation, water bodies, and
urbanization, whereas the tabular method uses ecological and geographic data.
Both systems predict the distribution of birds with an average accuracy of 85%,
offering a scalable but reliable method to understand bird migration.

Result: 在多个实际数学学习任务中验证了ExRec的有效性，并能推广到新问题，生成可解释的学习轨迹。

Conclusion: ExRec展示了知识追踪引导的强化学习在教育个性化中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise
recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds
on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate
student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key
aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential,
structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents
an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their
semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard
Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value
estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in
estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of
our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different
educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec
generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces
interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight
the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了感知与决策的统一，模拟了人类指挥官的认知过程，具有强适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: In multiple unmanned ground vehicle confrontations, autonomously evolving
multi-agent tactical decisions from situational awareness remain a significant
challenge. Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the
complicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement
learning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic
decisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language
model-based commander to address the issue of intelligent
perception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method
integrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight
large language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and
decision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and
interpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods,
the combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting
the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation and ablation experiments
validate that the proposed approach achieves a win rate of over 80% compared
with baseline models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code

translated code remains a challenge, limiting their effective adoption in
real-world software development. In this work, we propose F2STrans, a
function-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the
performance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages:
(1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using
high-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms,
and (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating
both positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel
code translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test
cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive
functional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and
existing datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code
translation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform
prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code
translation scenarios.

Conclusion: AI 代理驱动的去中心化交易所能够满足高性能和安全需求，并为传统非流动性资产提供民主化访问。

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires
bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict
requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present
GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized
AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold
into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart
contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision
making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the
flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents
(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a
coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled
pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token
issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The
Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5
percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:
an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a
simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user
impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000
concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based
decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance
and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing
access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model --
multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters
-- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system
integrity.

neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a
logical and a belief function. We show that our neurosymbolic AI definition
makes abstraction of key representative neurosymbolic AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous systems are becoming an integral part of many application domains,
like in the mobility sector. However, ensuring their safe and correct behaviour
in dynamic and complex environments remains a significant challenge, where
systems should autonomously make decisions e.g., about manoeuvring. We propose
in this paper a general collaborative approach for increasing the level of
trustworthiness in the environment of operation and improve reliability and
good decision making in autonomous system. In the presence of conflicting
information, aggregation becomes a major issue for trustworthy decision making
based on collaborative data sharing. Unlike classical approaches in the
literature that rely on consensus or majority as aggregation rule, we exploit
the fact that autonomous systems have different quality attributes like
perception quality. We use this criteria to determine which autonomous systems
are trustworthy and borrow concepts from social epistemology to define
aggregation and propagation rules, used for automated decision making. We use
Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as formal models for beliefs aggregation and
propagation, and formulate reduction rules to reduce the size of the BDDs and
allow efficient computation structures for collaborative automated reasoning.

*Alessandro Bertagnon,Marcello Dalpasso,Michele Favalli,Marco Gavanelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用答案集编程（ASP）精确计算组合电路最大延迟的方法，以替代传统的静态时序分析，从而提高处理器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态时序分析只能提供最大延迟的上界，可能导致处理器性能未被充分利用。

Method: 将问题建模为答案集编程（ASP），并提出非平凡的编码方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，ASP能够有效解决硬件设计中的复杂问题。

Conclusion: ASP是一种可行的解决方案，可用于精确计算组合电路的最大延迟。

Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum
delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is
crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an
Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to
perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,
synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum
clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static
Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can
be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead
to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In
this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum
delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally
hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring
extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem
into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address
complex problems in hardware design.

*Jin Li,Zezhong Ding,Xike Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DuetGraph提出了一种双路径全局-局部融合的粗到细知识图谱推理机制，解决了现有方法中分数过度平滑的问题，显著提升了推理质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱推理方法在处理全局和局部信息时容易导致分数过度平滑，模糊了正确与错误答案的区分，影响推理效果。

Method: DuetGraph通过分离全局（注意力机制）和局部（消息传递）信息的处理路径，避免相互干扰，并采用粗到细优化策略，将实体分为高低分集以缩小候选空间。

Result: 实验表明，DuetGraph在推理质量上提升了8.7%，训练效率提高了1.8倍，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DuetGraph通过双路径融合和粗到细优化，有效解决了分数过度平滑问题，显著提升了知识图谱推理的效果和效率。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across
various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and
local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods
often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between
correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address
this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with
dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by
segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message
passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,
preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.
In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which
partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the
candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which
alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a
1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

TL;DR: AgentOps框架为基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能代理系统提供了一套全面的观察、分析、优化和自动化操作方案，以应对其独特的不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在智能代理系统中的广泛应用，其不确定性（如概率推理、动态记忆状态和灵活执行路径）对传统软件运维方法提出了新挑战。

Method: 提出了AgentOps框架，包括行为观察、指标收集、问题检测、根因分析、优化建议和运行时自动化六个阶段的自动化流程。

Result: 该框架通过自动化管理不确定性，支持开发者、测试者、SRE和业务用户在不同生命周期阶段的需求，实现安全、自适应和高效的智能代理系统运行。

Conclusion: AgentOps通过自动化驯服不确定性，为智能代理系统的运维提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic
systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex,
adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling
powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of
uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and
fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations
practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing,
analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We
identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site
reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the
system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation
Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric
collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations,
and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of
automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not
by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and
effective operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决直接根据用户查询生成工作流时，LLM在复杂查询下输出逻辑性和可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 提出Opus工作流意图框架，包括从用户查询中提取工作流信号、解析为结构化意图对象，并基于意图生成工作流。

Result: 在1000个多意图查询-工作流对上的实验表明，该方法在语义相似性指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: Opus框架能有效提升LLM生成工作流的逻辑性和可靠性，尤其在混合意图场景下。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Prompt Intention Framework, designed to
improve complex Workflow Generation with instruction-tuned Large Language
Models (LLMs). We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user
queries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention
Framework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,
interpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating
Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables
LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query
complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent
query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to
Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow
similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention
Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to
LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable
LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow
Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the
proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to
direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention
Elicitation.

Motivation: 研究如何使AI驱动的决策与人类偏好一致，尤其是通过EW-QBAFs实现可争议性。

Method: 引入可争议性问题，提出G-RAEs量化边权重对目标论证强度的影响，并开发迭代算法调整权重。

Result: 在模拟个性化推荐系统和多层感知器的合成EW-QBAFs上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: G-RAEs和迭代算法能有效解决EW-QBAFs的可争议性问题，为AI决策的可争议性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human
preferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support
contestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks
(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs
can be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability
problem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)
to achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a
topic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation
attribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic
argument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing
interpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building
on G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the
edge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach
experimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural
characteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer
perceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动的需求导航（DDN）方法依赖预收集数据，泛化能力有限，无法适应未知场景。CogDDN旨在通过模拟人类认知机制解决这一问题。

Method: CogDDN通过语义对齐检测对象与指令，结合启发式和分析式决策模块，并利用思维链（CoT）推理优化决策过程。

Result: 在AI2Thor模拟器和ProcThor数据集上的评估显示，CogDDN比单视角相机方法性能提升15%，导航准确性和适应性显著提高。

Conclusion: CogDDN通过模拟人类认知机制，显著提升了机器人在未知环境中的导航能力，展示了其在需求导航任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within
unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven
navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on
implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,
traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model
training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in
unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that
emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and
slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to
fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by
semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.
Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising
a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that
analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously
improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the
decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor
simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view
camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in
navigation accuracy and adaptability. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流决策需要快速、连续的重规划，传统方法速度慢且无法处理不确定性，而大语言模型虽快但存在误解和幻觉风险。

Method: 引入神经符号框架，将用户请求转换为结构化规划规范，量化不确定性，并在置信度低时触发交互式澄清循环。

Result: 轻量级模型在100个不确定性过滤示例上微调后，性能超越GPT-4.1，推理延迟降低近50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂物流提供了可验证、实时且用户对齐的决策路径。

Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead
of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical
decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous
replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics
plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume
an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for
uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle
uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to
entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they
remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety
and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility
of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.
It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies
its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive
clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A
lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,
surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency
by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward
certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，结合代码文本建模和结构化建模的优势。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但暗示新方法有望提升代码分析和生成能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合代码文本和结构化建模，新方法有望弥补现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Code LLMs have become extremely popular recently for modeling source code
across a variety of tasks, such as generation, translation, and summarization.
However, transformer-based models are limited in their capabilities to reason
through structured, analytical properties of code, such as control and data
flow. Previous work has explored the modeling of these properties with
structured data and graph neural networks. However, these approaches lack the
generative capabilities and scale of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach to combine the strengths of modeling both code as text and more
structured forms.

Result: 进化动力学可以在个体生命周期内运作，丰富了学习视角，并探讨了奖励假设和代理问题的解决方向。

Conclusion: 进化理论为强化学习提供了新的视角，但代理问题需要结合生命起源理论进一步研究。

Abstract: Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition
of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward
hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with
major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired
by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three "dogmas." We
revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To
make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first
establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains
over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational
processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary
insights to enrich the "adaptation-rather-than-search" view of learning. We
then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,
using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.
multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration
in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence
of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the
evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it
gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from
origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication
offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained
reinforcement learning in biological systems.

Abstract: Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even
hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following
capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been
characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a
single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500
keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure
how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density
increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers
and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the
max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning
capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias
towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following
errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in
real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs.
We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at

Method: 提出了MultiVox基准测试，包含1000个人工标注和录制的语音对话，涵盖多种副语言特征和视觉线索（如图像和视频）。

Conclusion: MultiVox填补了现有基准测试的不足，为评估多模态语音助手的综合能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered omni models
to act as voice assistants capable of understanding spoken dialogues. These
models can process multimodal inputs beyond text, such as speech and visual
data, enabling more context-aware interactions. However, current benchmarks
fall short in comprehensively evaluating how well these models generate
context-aware responses, particularly when it comes to implicitly understanding
fine-grained speech characteristics, such as pitch, emotion, timbre, and volume
or the environmental acoustic context such as background sounds. Additionally,
they inadequately assess the ability of models to align paralinguistic cues
with complementary visual signals to inform their responses. To address these
gaps, we introduce MultiVox, the first omni voice assistant benchmark designed
to evaluate the ability of voice assistants to integrate spoken and visual cues
including paralinguistic speech features for truly multimodal understanding.
Specifically, MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated and recorded speech
dialogues that encompass diverse paralinguistic features and a range of visual
cues such as images and videos. Our evaluation on 9 state-of-the-art models
reveals that, although humans excel at these tasks, current models consistently
struggle to produce contextually grounded responses.

TL;DR: EmoSApp是一款基于智能手机的离线对话应用，利用优化的大型语言模型（LLMs）为心理健康提供支持，解决了用户可访问性、网络连接和数据隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字心理健康平台面临用户可访问性、网络连接和数据隐私的挑战，需要一种离线的智能手机解决方案。

Method: 通过优化和量化LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct模型，并结合自定义的心理健康知识数据集，开发了EmoSApp。

Result: 定性评估显示EmoSApp能提供连贯、共情的对话和建议；定量评估证明其在低资源环境下的有效性。

Conclusion: EmoSApp为便携、安全且高度定制化的AI心理健康解决方案提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an
individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to
expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent
challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and
data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based
solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support
App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化工具链，用于处理法律、医疗和行政文本数据，支持隐私敏感的大规模分析，通过LLM实现标准化、总结和匿名化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化文本（如法律、医疗和行政文件）是公共健康和社会科学研究的重要资源，但敏感信息和数据异质性限制了其大规模分析。

Method: 工具链利用开源模型在本地硬件上运行，通过LLM提示标准化、总结和翻译文本，并结合命名实体识别和规则方法实现匿名化。

Result: 在瑞典法院判决数据集上验证，工具链能有效移除敏感信息并保留语义内容，支持半自动化内容分析。

Conclusion: 该工具链为隐私敏感领域的大规模文本分析提供了新可能，解决了数据隐私和异质性带来的限制。

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，自然语言解释（NLEs）成为理解模型行为的关键，需要对其特性和治理影响进行系统研究。

Method: 基于可解释AI（XAI）文献，构建了一个针对NLEs的更新分类法，涵盖三个维度：上下文、生成与呈现、评估。

Result: 该分类法为研究人员、审计者和政策制定者提供了一个框架，用于描述、设计和改进NLEs。

Conclusion: 该分类法有助于提升AI系统的透明度，支持有效的AI治理。

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（事实性错误），影响实际部署的可信度。

Method: 结合自动提示重写、混合检索和低秩适配器调优，通过幻觉检测模块和反馈校正循环提升事实一致性。

Result: AutoRAG-LoRA显著减少了事实漂移，同时保持了模型的效率和模块化。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在AI任务中表现出色，但其在手语生成中的应用有限，主要由于手语的复杂性和独特规则。

Method: 通过微调LLM，将其视为另一种自然语言，并采用逐步提示策略提取LLM中的手语知识。

Result: 在How2Sign和Phoenix14T数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效利用LLM的手语知识和推理能力。

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign成功地将LLM应用于手语生成，解决了手语与口语之间的分布和语法差异。

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过语言表达（verbalized uncertainty）来增强用户对大型语言模型（LLM）输出的信任，提出模仿人类沟通的“拟人化不确定性”概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM输出常以过度自信的语言呈现，即使准确性存疑，这削弱了用户对其的信任。需要一种方法通过语言信号传达模型的置信度。

Method: 综述人类不确定性沟通研究，分析现有数据偏差，提出拟人化不确定性概念，并分解为未来研究方向。

Result: 揭示了现有研究中被忽视的语言偏差，强调了拟人化不确定性在提升沟通信任中的重要性。

Conclusion: 拟人化不确定性是提升LLM与用户沟通信任的关键，未来研究应关注其语言真实性和个性化实现。

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

TL;DR: PLEX是一种无需扰动的局部解释方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，显著提高了解释效率，与LIME和SHAP效果相当但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在文本分类中表现优异，但其复杂性导致解释性差，而现有XAI方法（如LIME和SHAP）计算成本高。

Method: 提出PLEX方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，无需扰动即可生成高效解释。

Result: 在四个分类任务中，PLEX与LIME和SHAP的一致性超过92%，且计算效率提升显著。

Conclusion: PLEX为LLM的文本分类提供了一种高效且可靠的解释方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何建模用户情感状态，以确保其伦理部署。

Method: 基于情感轮（心理学框架）分析模型输出中情感状态的概率依赖关系。

Result: LLMs形成分层情感树，与人类心理模型一致，但存在情感识别的系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的情感推理能力，并建议用认知理论改进模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人服务网站（ASW）广告文本常被用于识别性交易受害者，但其文本分析面临语法混乱、表情符号滥用和故意模糊等问题，亟需高效的语言建模方法。

Method: 研究比较了多种语言建模方法，包括信息检索、预训练Transformer和定制化Transformer模型，并在小规模GPU资源下训练高效模型。

Result: 定制化Transformer模型在准确性、召回率、F1分数和ROC AUC上优于BERT-base、RoBERTa和ModernBERT等模型，并在ASW数据分析任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 定制化Transformer模型为ASW文本分析提供了显著进步，可支持多种下游应用和研究。

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交平台上的仇恨言论并不总是因社会认可（如点赞）而增加，甚至在某些情况下呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社会认可（如点赞）如何影响仇恨言论的产生，验证Walther的社会认可理论。

Method: 分析Parler平台上2018-2021年的1.1亿条帖子，研究点赞与后续仇恨言论的关系。

Result: 点赞数量与后续仇恨言论无显著关联，甚至在某些时间区间呈负相关。

Conclusion: 社会认可对仇恨言论的强化机制在特定平台上可能不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

Motivation: LLMs在高风险领域（如司法）的应用日益增多，但其公平性及其对社会正义的影响尚未充分研究。确保LLMs作为法官时的公平性是建立其可信度的前提。

Method: 基于司法公平理论，构建了一个包含65个标签和161个值的评估框架，并开发了三个评估指标（不一致性、偏见和不平衡准确性）。通过实验评估了16个LLMs。

Result: 实验发现LLMs普遍存在不一致性、偏见和不平衡准确性，尤其在人口统计标签上偏见更明显。调整温度参数可影响公平性，但模型大小、发布日期和来源国无显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在司法系统中的公平性存在严重问题，需进一步研究和改进。论文提供了一个公开工具包以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户与系统风格相似性对用户印象的影响，区分主观与客观相似性。

Result: 发现主观风格相似性与用户偏好呈强正相关，且主观与客观相似性存在差异。

Conclusion: 强调区分主观与客观评价的重要性，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

TL;DR: HanjaBridge通过注入多义汉字候选和持续预训练，显著提升了韩语低资源语言模型的性能，并在跨语言迁移中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决韩语中同音异义汉字词在韩文脚本中的语义模糊问题，提升低资源语言模型的性能。

Method: 提出HanjaBridge技术，在持续预训练框架中注入多义汉字候选，结合知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在KoBALT基准上相对提升21%，并观察到积极的跨语言迁移效果。

Conclusion: HanjaBridge有效解决了语义模糊问题，且无需推理时额外成本，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分层低秩适应（LoRA）的方法，用于检测英语和西班牙语推文中的性别歧视，通过条件适配器路由建模标签依赖关系，并在多语言训练中实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本性别歧视检测任务，特别是在多语言环境下，需要高效且参数节约的方法。

Method: 采用分层LoRA适配器，对所有线性变换进行适应，并通过多语言训练实现跨语言迁移。

Result: 方法在多任务中表现优异（如二元分类F1为0.6774），同时显著减少训练时间和存储需求。

Conclusion: 分层LoRA在多语言性别歧视检测中高效且性能优越，适合实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

Motivation: 解决现有立场检测研究在长文本和低资源语言上的局限性，以促进新闻推荐中的观点多样性和媒体偏见分析。

Method: 提出JoA-ICL框架，利用语言模型代理预测关键结构段落的立场，并聚合为整体文章立场。

Conclusion: 研究为长文本立场检测提供了新方法和数据集，有助于改善新闻推荐系统的多样性和媒体偏见研究。

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

Conclusion: LLM在临床决策支持系统（CDSS）中潜力巨大，可推动早期预警系统发展，并将患者叙述转化为可操作的风险评估。

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨境金融活动的增加使得准确识别和分类外国实体变得至关重要，尤其是在西班牙金融系统中，这对风险管理、合规和防止金融不当行为至关重要。

Method: 研究比较了传统匹配算法（如Jaccard、余弦和Levenshtein距离）、基于Hugging Face的LLMs和接口型LLMs（如Microsoft Copilot、阿里巴巴的Qwen 2.5）在65个葡萄牙公司案例上的表现。

Result: 传统方法准确率超过92%，但假阳性率较高（20-40%）；接口型LLMs表现更优，准确率超过93%，F1分数超过96%，假阳性率更低（40-80%）。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在实体匹配任务中优于传统方法，尤其在处理语境、缩写和法律变更方面表现突出。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

TL;DR: 论文提出了DIJA，一种针对扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）的越狱攻击框架，揭示了其独特的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐机制无法保护dLLMs免受上下文感知的掩码输入对抗性提示的攻击，暴露了新的安全威胁。

Method: DIJA通过构造对抗性交错掩码-文本提示，利用dLLMs的双向建模和平行解码机制，绕过标准对齐机制。

Result: DIJA显著优于现有越狱方法，在多个指标上表现突出，如100%关键词ASR和更高的StrongREJECT分数。

Conclusion: 研究强调了重新思考dLLMs安全对齐的紧迫性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

Method: 提出一个框架研究LLMs中的毒化问题，展示多触发器可共存且互不干扰，并通过高嵌入相似性的触发器实现鲁棒激活。

Result: 发现LLMs存在更广泛且持久的漏洞，提出一种选择性重训练方法，能高效移除触发器行为。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了多触发器毒化的威胁，并提出了一种实用的防御方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which

few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%

Motivation: 研究旨在解决LLMs中个人数据记忆的问题，特别是如何识别和量化这些数据，以支持“被遗忘权”（RTBF）的实现。

Method: 引入WikiMem数据集和模型无关的度量方法，通过校准负对数似然对真实值和反事实进行排序。

Result: 研究发现记忆化与主题的网络存在和模型规模相关，并提供了识别个人数据记忆的基础。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态构建遗忘集提供了支持，有助于实现机器遗忘和RTBF请求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

Motivation: 探索多智能体系统（MAS）在定性研究中的潜力，特别是其在编码和数据标注任务中的表现，以及与单智能体系统的对比。

Method: 通过实验研究，使用六种开源LLM和18种配置，分析了77,000多个编码决策，对比人类标注的黄金标准数据集。

Result: 温度和智能体角色显著影响共识构建，但多智能体系统在编码准确性上未普遍优于单智能体。仅特定模型和配置下，MAS表现出优势。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在定性研究中的局限性，挑战了多智能体角色多样性必然带来更好结果的假设，并开源了实验代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

Motivation: 现有资源主要针对英语和美国社会背景，缺乏对其他语言和社会环境的偏见评估工具。

Method: 基于BBQ数据集，设计了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的平行数据集，采用多选题形式评估10类社会偏见。

Result: LLMs在模糊场景中易出错，高准确率往往与依赖社会偏见相关。

Conclusion: 需进一步改进LLMs以减少偏见，尤其是在非英语和非美国社会背景下的表现。

Abstract: Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)
perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable
lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English,
and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the
Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and
CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to
assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

Result: 在FTP和RTSP协议上的实验表明，FlowFSM提取精度高，且减少了虚假转换。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理系统在协议分析和FSM推断中具有潜力，适用于网络安全和逆向工程。

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的方法SAE-LAPE，用于识别大型语言模型（LLMs）中的语言特定特征，发现这些特征主要出现在模型的中间到最终层，并影响多语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs的多语言机制仍具挑战性，现有研究多关注单个神经元，但难以分离语言特定特征。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）学习跨语言的单义特征，并提出SAE-LAPE方法基于特征激活概率识别语言特定特征。

Result: 发现语言特定特征主要位于模型的中间到最终层，可解释性强，且能用于语言识别，性能与fastText相当。

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE方法有效识别语言特定特征，为理解LLMs的多语言机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KV-Latent通过降采样Key-Value向量维度到潜在空间，显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，仅需少量额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder架构的KV Cache在推理过程中逐渐增加，成为内存消耗和数据传输带宽的主要效率瓶颈。

Method: 提出KV-Latent范式，降采样Key-Value向量维度到潜在空间，并改进Rotary Positional Embedding的频率采样机制以增强稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，KV-Latent在减少KV Cache占用和提升推理速度方面表现优异，且对模型性能影响小。

Conclusion: KV-Latent为构建高效语言模型系统提供了新思路，并展示了KV Cache节省和高效LLMs的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale
datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct
formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$

making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it
delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类专家知识和大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，用于评估学术论文的方法新颖性，解决了传统评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新颖性评估方法（专家判断或引用组合）存在知识有限和效果不确定的问题，LLM和人类专家各有优势，结合两者可以弥补不足。

Method: 从同行评审报告中提取新颖性相关句子，利用LLM总结论文方法部分，用于微调预训练语言模型（PLM），并设计了基于稀疏注意力的文本引导融合模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在评估方法新颖性方面优于大量基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合人类知识和LLM的方法能有效提升学术论文新颖性评估的准确性。

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 现有PMRs在结构、复杂性和可用性上差异显著，且缺乏系统比较，导致PMG任务难以评估。

Method: 研究引入了一个包含55个流程描述和九种PMRs的新数据集（PMo Dataset），并从LLM适用性和PMG性能两个维度评估PMRs。

Result: Mermaid在六项PMo标准中得分最高，而BPMN text在流程元素相似性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为PMRs的选择提供了实证依据，Mermaid和BPMN text分别在不同场景下表现最优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Result: 加权损失函数提高了高频情感类的性能，但对少数类影响有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签情感检测中有效，但仍面临对少数类效果不足的挑战。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a simple weighted loss function to
Transformer-based models for multi-label emotion detection in SemEval-2025
Shared Task 11. Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting
class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes
without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate
BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such
as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients.
The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on
high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes.
These findings underscore both the effectiveness and the challenges of applying
this approach to imbalanced multi-label emotion detection.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了评估数据污染的担忧，污染可能导致性能指标虚高，影响模型真实泛化能力的评估。

Method: DCR框架通过轻量级、可解释的流程检测和量化四种污染级别（语义、信息、数据和标签），并使用模糊推理系统合成污染分数，生成统一的DCR因子来调整原始准确性。

Result: 在9个LLMs（0.5B-72B）和三个任务（情感分析、假新闻检测和算术推理）上验证，DCR框架能可靠诊断污染严重程度，调整后的准确性误差平均在4%以内。

Conclusion: DCR框架计算高效且透明，为常规评估提供了实用的污染检测工具，有助于更公平的比较和提升LLM基准测试的可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large
language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on
the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more
light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed
acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model
fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of
$1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their
associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed
empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in
the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Result: 编码器在分类和检索任务中表现更好，解码器在生成任务中更优，转换训练目标效果不佳。

Conclusion: 编码器和解码器架构各有优势，直接转换训练目标不如专注于各自擅长任务。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific

single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical

consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 香港的多语言环境、独特的法律框架和文化需求促使开发一个专门的大语言模型，以支持本地化的AI应用。

Method: 基于DeepSeek架构，通过全参数微调和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，开发了HKGAI-V1，并设计了对抗性香港价值基准以评估模型对齐。

Result: HKGAI-V1在文化敏感查询上优于通用模型，并提供了可复制的区域AI系统开发蓝图。

Conclusion: HKGAI-V1不仅是一个技术成果，还为其他地区开发本地化AI系统提供了参考。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems"
framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful

TL;DR: 研究发现，在酒店亮点总结中，简单的词重叠指标与人类判断相关性高（Spearman 0.63），而复杂方法在跨域数据中表现不佳。LLM生成高质量总结但评估不可靠，且众包评估存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的酒店亮点总结的忠实性评估方法，以解决实际业务中错误信息带来的风险。

Method: 通过人类评估活动（分类错误评估和细粒度标注），比较传统指标、可训练方法和LLM作为评估者的表现。

Result: 简单指标（如词重叠）与人类判断相关性高，LLM评估不可靠，错误信息风险最大。

Conclusion: 建议使用简单指标评估忠实性，并注意LLM评估的局限性及众包评估的挑战。

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

TL;DR: TREC Deep Learning track第四年，利用MS MARCO数据集和更新的集合，专注于构建更完整的测试集，深度神经排序模型表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建更完整的测试集以提升查询和判断质量，并验证深度神经排序模型的性能。

Method: 利用MS MARCO数据集和更新的集合，专注于通道检索任务，文档排序任务通过通道级标签推断。

Result: 深度神经排序模型表现优于传统方法，但今年密集检索的顶级表现不如去年。

Conclusion: 测试集质量提升，深度神经排序模型持续领先，但密集检索表现有所变化。

Abstract: This is the fourth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous
years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of
human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and
document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$
times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times
increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we
mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage
retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document
ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were
inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to
previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our
judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of
this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish
between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in
overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs
that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they
were last year.

TL;DR: Elevate3D是一个新框架，将低质量3D资产提升为高质量，通过HFS-SDEdit方法增强纹理，并结合几何优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量3D资产稀缺且获取成本高，Elevate3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用HFS-SDEdit增强纹理，结合单目几何预测器优化几何，逐视图交替优化。

Result: Elevate3D在3D模型细化中达到最先进质量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Elevate3D有效缓解了高质量开源3D资产的短缺问题。

Abstract: High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer
graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs.
To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that
transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the
core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that
significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and
geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a
view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement.
Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our
framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by
employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures
detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced
texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art
quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of
high-quality open-source 3D assets.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了DroidCollection，一个包含百万代码样本、七种编程语言和43种编码模型输出的数据集，以及基于此训练的DroidDetect检测器。实验表明现有检测器泛化能力不足，但通过对抗训练可以改进。


<details>

Motivation: 构建一个全面的数据集（DroidCollection）以训练和评估机器生成代码检测器，解决现有检测器泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 开发DroidCollection数据集，包含多样化的代码样本和对抗样本；基于此训练多任务目标检测器DroidDetect。

Result: 现有检测器在多样编程语言和领域泛化能力差，但对抗训练可提升性能；使用度量学习和不确定性重采样可优化训练。

Conclusion: DroidCollection和DroidDetect为机器生成代码检测提供了更全面的解决方案，对抗训练和优化方法显著提升检测效果。

Abstract: In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most
extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code
detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages,
outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains.
Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI
co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade
detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite
of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over
$\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors'
performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming
languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate
that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output
distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this
problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial
data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and
uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly
noisy distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy as Code（PaC）的复杂性阻碍了其采用，ARPaCCino旨在通过自动化生成和验证规则来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合LLM、RAG和工具验证，从自然语言描述生成Rego规则，并验证IaC合规性。

Result: 实验证明ARPaCCino能生成正确规则，识别不合规基础设施，并进行修正，即使使用小型LLM。

Conclusion: ARPaCCino展示了基于RAG的架构在提升PaC工作流自动化、可靠性和可访问性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Policy as Code (PaC) is a paradigm that encodes security and compliance
policies into machine-readable formats, enabling automated enforcement in
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments. However, its adoption is hindered by
the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this
work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation
to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural
language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego
rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations
to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and
integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy
validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC
frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study
demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and
semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and
applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs.
Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the
automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型管道在动态优化输出时，面对竞争软约束会导致低效回溯循环。

Method: 引入Meta Self-Refining框架，利用元修正层监控执行历史，检测振荡失败，并通过元修复器LM合成策略指令平衡需求。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能成功修复回溯循环，提升语言模型程序的效率。

Conclusion: Meta Self-Refining有效解决了竞争约束问题，优化了语言模型管道的性能。

Abstract: Language Model (LM) pipelines can dynamically refine their outputs against
programmatic constraints. However, their effectiveness collapses when faced
with competing soft constraints, leading to inefficient backtracking loops
where satisfying one constraint violates another. We introduce Meta
Self-Refining, a framework that equips LM pipelines with a meta-corrective
layer to repair these competitions at runtime/inference-time. Our approach
monitors the pipeline's execution history to detect oscillatory failures. Upon
detection, it invokes a meta-repairer LM that analyzes the holistic state of
the backtracking attempts and synthesizes a strategic instruction to balance
the competing requirements. This self-repair instruction guides the original LM
out of a failing refining loop towards a successful output. Our results show
Meta Self-Refining can successfully repair these loops, leading to more
efficient LM programs.

Motivation: 现有SWE-bench数据集存在严重的数据污染问题（如解决方案泄漏和测试用例不足），限制了大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中的应用。

Method: 采用自动化管道从GitHub收集真实问题，并进行严格质量验证，生成约10,000个潜在任务（目前300个样本可用）。

Result: 使用Aider编码代理评估，SWE-MERA在最新LLMs中表现出强大的区分能力，报告了2024年9月至2025年6月收集的任务性能。

Conclusion: SWE-MERA通过动态更新和严格验证，有效解决了数据污染问题，为LLMs在软件工程中的评估提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering
has revealed critical limitations in existing benchmarks, particularly the
widely used SWE-bench dataset. Recent studies have uncovered severe data
contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches
involve direct solution leakage and 31.08\% pass due to inadequate test cases.
We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to
address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of
real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach
implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing
contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300
samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding agent
demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We report

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在代码任务中主要学习表面语法模式，缺乏语义理解能力，导致在调试和优化等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出使用大规模数据集对模型进行微调，专门针对代码理解任务，以增强其语义理解能力。

Result: 微调后模型性能显著提升，特别是QWQ-32B模型在主观评分任务中准确率从70%提高到83.47%。

Conclusion: 微调能有效提升大语言模型的代码理解能力，DPO微调的Codestral-22B在主观评分任务中达到最高准确率87.66%。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like
code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large
amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next
Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns
in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the
ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the
reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To
address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code
comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more
robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of
varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess
semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In
particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe
that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks.
The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy
increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across
other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability.
Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest
micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeAssistBench (CAB) 是一个新的基准框架，用于评估多轮编程辅助在真实环境中的表现，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注代码生成任务，且多为单轮交互，无法反映真实项目环境中的复杂需求。

Method: CAB 通过自动从 GitHub 问题生成数据集，并容器化代码库进行多轮交互评估。

Result: 测试显示，主流 LLMs 在 Stack Overflow 问题上表现良好（70-83%），但在 CAB 的复杂问题上成功率仅 16.49%。

Conclusion: CAB 揭示了在项目特定环境中提供编程辅助的挑战，强调了真实场景评估的重要性。

Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models have transformed
software development, yet most benchmarks focus narrowly on code generation
tasks. Recent efforts like InfiBench and StackEval attempt to address this gap
using Stack Overflow data but remain limited to single-turn interactions in
isolated contexts, require significant manual curation, and fail to represent
complete project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first
benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in
realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases.
Unlike existing programming Q&A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates
scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable
parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages),
and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then
evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments
with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of
3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven
programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading
LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack
Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49%
of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing
assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone
questions.

Abstract: Conversational agents, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, have become
essential in software development, boosting productivity, collaboration, and
automating various tasks. This paper examines the role of adaptive AI-powered
conversational agents in software development, highlighting their ability to
offer dynamic, context-aware assistance to developers. Unlike traditional
rule-based systems, adaptive AI agents use machine learning and natural
language processing to learn from interactions and improve over time, providing
more personalized and responsive help. We look at how these tools have evolved
from simple query-based systems to advanced AI-driven solutions like GitHub
Copilot and Microsoft Teams bots. We also explore the challenges of integrating
adaptive AI into software development processes. The study aims to assess the
benefits and limitations of these systems, address concerns like data privacy
and ethical issues, and offer insights into their future use in the field.
Ultimately, adaptive AI chatbots have great potential to revolutionize software
development by delivering real-time, customized support and enhancing the
efficiency of development cycles.

Result: LLMs表现出风险中性决策模式，偶尔与规范性推理不一致，且其回答与坦桑尼亚参与者最相似。

Conclusion: LLMs的决策行为受文化和训练数据影响，研究为理解其模拟人类行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) approach financial
decision-making by systematically comparing their responses to those of human
participants across the globe. We posed a set of commonly used financial
decision-making questions to seven leading LLMs, including five models from the
GPT series(GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o1, o3-mini), Gemini 2.0 Flash, and DeepSeek R1. We
then compared their outputs to human responses drawn from a dataset covering 53
nations. Our analysis reveals three main results. First, LLMs generally exhibit
a risk-neutral decision-making pattern, favoring choices aligned with expected
value calculations when faced with lottery-type questions. Second, when
evaluating trade-offs between present and future, LLMs occasionally produce
responses that appear inconsistent with normative reasoning. Third, when we
examine cross-national similarities, we find that the LLMs' aggregate responses
most closely resemble those of participants from Tanzania. These findings
contribute to the understanding of how LLMs emulate human-like decision
behaviors and highlight potential cultural and training influences embedded
within their outputs.

Conclusion: AGFS-Tractometry能够检测到细微或空间局部的白质差异，相关模板和代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo
mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an
advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to
investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber
tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract
differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this
study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely
AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation
testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.
There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel
atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,
along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a
novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable
simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for
multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets
with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry
with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract
Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the
proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in
detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,
AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which
are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these
demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially
localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and
related code are available at:

Motivation: 解决泊松逆问题中数据保真度项的建模问题，传统方法在收敛性和参数调优上存在不足。

Method: 提出基于镜像下降的DEQ框架，利用非欧几何适应数据项结构，确保收敛性并提供高效训练和推理策略。

Conclusion: 新方法在泊松逆问题中表现出色，兼具高效性和鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed
points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization
functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where
assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard
(proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application
of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more
appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we
introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a
tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the
data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled
training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the
convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational
strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free
inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional
model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman
Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,
sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/christiandaniele/DEQ-MD.

information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a
hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a
domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz
decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm
for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common
theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which
covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods
need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to
compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the
bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on
applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training,
illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出多智能体韧性（group resilience）概念，强调协作对提升韧性的重要性，并通过实验验证协作协议的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体强化学习（MARL）中智能体如何通过协作应对环境动态变化，填补单智能体韧性研究的空白。

Method: 提出并形式化多智能体韧性概念，设计不同协作协议，并在实验中对比协作与非协作方法的韧性表现。

Result: 实验表明，所有协作方法均比非协作方法表现出更高的群体韧性。

Conclusion: 协作是提升多智能体韧性的关键因素，为MARL中的韧性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: To effectively operate in various dynamic scenarios, RL agents must be
resilient to unexpected changes in their environment. Previous work on this
form of resilience has focused on single-agent settings. In this work, we
introduce and formalize a multi-agent variant of resilience, which we term
group resilience. We further hypothesize that collaboration with other agents
is key to achieving group resilience; collaborating agents adapt better to
environmental perturbations in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
settings. We test our hypothesis empirically by evaluating different
collaboration protocols and examining their effect on group resilience. Our
experiments show that all the examined collaborative approaches achieve higher
group resilience than their non-collaborative counterparts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的工具间匹配（TTTM）方法，解决了传统方法在异构设备环境中的局限性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTTM方法依赖静态配置数据或黄金参考，难以在商业生产线中应用，且不适用于异构设备环境。

Method: 提出基于数据方差和模式数量的新型TTTM分析流程，包括单变量和多变量方法。

Result: 最佳单变量方法与方差和模式数量的相关系数分别超过0.95和0.5；多变量方法与单变量方法的相关系数超过0.75。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在TTTM问题中表现有效，并对算法超参数进行了敏感性分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber
matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional
TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden
reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line.
Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting,
where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different
equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these
issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance
and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves
a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes,
respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best
multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the
top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we
analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm
hyper-parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进标准交叉熵损失函数，以提升分类任务的优化效果。

Method: 在标准交叉熵损失函数中引入一个依赖于真实类预测概率的附加项。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet模型验证，分类准确率优于标准交叉熵损失函数，且效率相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为损失函数设计提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel
measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard
cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that
depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to
enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot
encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based
model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed
one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms
of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity,
achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy
loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for
future research into loss function design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习和Transformer在许多领域取得了成功，但其理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过回顾线性代数、概率和优化等关键概念，详细分析了多头自注意力机制和反向传播算法，并提出了一个通用的Transformer近似定理。

Result: 证明了单层Transformer可以任意精度近似任何连续序列到序列的映射。

Conclusion: 研究结果推动了Transformer模型的理论理解，并缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the
backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many
domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer.
Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based
models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT
and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology.
However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this
paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and
Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts
from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning,
and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation
algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem
for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one
self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU
activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a
compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a
complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical
implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding
of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Result: RL在数学领域有轻微提升，SFT在知识密集型任务上表现更差；SFT对模型参数的影响更大。

Conclusion: RL可能增强现有能力，而SFT可能替换旧技能；冻结部分模型参数的效果不明确。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code
datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly
popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a
comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same
model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains
on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU,
while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters
across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights
the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer
MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the
out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of
the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with
benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together,
our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing
capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于编码器-解码器架构的小型语言模型（SLM），用于预测产品和服务的税务代码，解决了多层级税务代码序列预测的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨国企业每天处理大量交易，需遵守不同司法管辖区的税务规定，准确预测税务代码（如HSN或SAC）对避免税务处罚至关重要。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构的SLM，利用非结构化数据生成层级税务代码序列，捕捉代码间的依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在层级税务代码预测任务中优于扁平分类器，且性能优于仅编码器或仅解码器架构。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他政府规定的税务代码（如UNSPSC或NCM），为税务合规领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特征选择研究存在基准测试不足和依赖专有数据集的问题，影响了可复现性和性能。

Method: 开发了MH-FSF框架，包含17种特征选择方法（11种经典，6种领域特定），并在10个公开的Android恶意软件数据集上进行了系统评估。

Result: 结果显示性能在不同平衡和不平衡数据集上有差异，强调了数据预处理和选择标准的重要性。

Conclusion: MH-FSF框架为特征选择方法提供了统一的比较平台，促进了方法的一致性和严谨性，为Android恶意软件检测等新研究方向铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feature selection is vital for building effective predictive models, as it
reduces dimensionality and emphasizes key features. However, current research
often suffers from limited benchmarking and reliance on proprietary datasets.
This severely hinders reproducibility and can negatively impact overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce the MH-FSF framework, a
comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform designed to facilitate the
reproduction and implementation of feature selection methods. Developed through
collaborative research, MH-FSF provides implementations of 17 methods (11
classical, 6 domain-specific) and enables systematic evaluation on 10 publicly
available Android malware datasets. Our results reveal performance variations
across both balanced and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the critical need
for data preprocessing and selection criteria that account for these
asymmetries. We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing
diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and
rigor. By providing this framework, we aim to significantly broaden the
existing literature and pave the way for new research directions in feature
selection, particularly within the context of Android malware detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习中，数据流的异质性、分布漂移和标签缺失是主要挑战，需要一种灵活且高效的方法。

Method: OL-MDISF通过构建潜在copula表示、检测漂移和结构感知伪标记来解决这些问题。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在漂移场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: OL-MDISF为复杂、弱监督的流数据学习提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible
learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still
faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data
streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric
modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an
abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often
infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To
address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed,
Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent
copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via
ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware
pseudo-labeling.
  This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF.
It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling,
drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of
experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios.
These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal
ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for
online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法假设一阶项可忽略，但实际补偿过程中一阶偏差累积导致假设不成立，需改进。

Method: FOEM直接计算潜在权重与全精度权重的差异近似梯度，利用预计算的Cholesky因子高效恢复Hessian子矩阵逆。

Result: FOEM在3位量化下显著降低困惑度（Llama3-8B降低89.6%），提升准确率（Llama3-70B从51.7%到74.9%）。

Conclusion: FOEM优于现有方法，可与其他先进技术结合，进一步缩小与全精度基线的差距。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is
available at https://github.com/Xingyu-Zheng/FOEM.

Motivation: 属性缺失图的深度图聚类在实际应用中至关重要，但现有填补方法未能充分利用节点邻域信息，导致结果不可靠。

Conclusion: DTRGC通过分层填补和聚类信息修正，有效解决了属性缺失图的聚类问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised
task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct
clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical
applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing
imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the
varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to
unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.
To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph
Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known
neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to
iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering
information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware
Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting
propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,
Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing
nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood
attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups
with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster
structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.
Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information
across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node
representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show
that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC
methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Motivation: 边缘设备上运行大型语言模型（LLM）面临通信带宽和计算资源的限制，现有LoRA方法采用固定或启发式秩配置，传输效率低。

Method: AirLLM将秩配置建模为结构化动作向量，结合PPO生成粗粒度决策，并通过DDIM细化生成高分辨率、任务和信道自适应的秩向量。

Result: 实验表明，AirLLM在不同信噪比下均能提升微调性能并显著减少传输成本。

Conclusion: AirLLM通过强化学习和扩散模型优化LoRA秩配置，实现了高效、可扩展的远程微调。

Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly
challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and
memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.
Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ
fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air
transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address
this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework
for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank
configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted
projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential
decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates
coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic
complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The
two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.
Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM
consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing
transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,
diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning
over the air.

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking
services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant
challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement.
Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential
solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only
encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios
but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these
challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the
performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive
foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training
strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and
preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through
extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and
achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56%
in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore,
through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content
detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by
14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results
establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating
excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 生成了包含20,000多种布局配置的数据集，这些热图与真实布局相似，并提高了下游ML任务的准确性。

Conclusion: DALI-PD为物理设计中的机器学习研究提供了高效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various
physical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by
the availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such
datasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very
few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate,
and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD,
a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML
in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout
heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop,
congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a
dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts
and placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML
accuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学联邦学习中的数据隐私保护问题，同时应对标签噪声和类别不平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出全局样本选择器（Global Sample Selector）和客户端自适应调整机制（CAA），结合伪标签生成和鲁棒损失函数。

Result: 在多种噪声条件下（对称、非对称、极端和异构噪声）表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedGSCA显著提升模型稳定性和噪声处理能力，适用于真实医学联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that
increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent
studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where
performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as
sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of
data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive
empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and
non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling.
High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information,
while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance
improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts
performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality
and diversity.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm
design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within
search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms.
However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general
coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored
for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how
well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this
paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring
fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank
based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality,
then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM
outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm
design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform
their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and
match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover,
we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm
design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings.
These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in
algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

Motivation: 探索算法创新对计算资源的需求及其对AI进步的影响。

Method: 分析了36种Llama 3和DeepSeek-V3中的预训练算法创新，估计了开发所需的总FLOP和硬件FLOP/s。

Result: 资源需求每年翻倍，但即使严格的计算限制（如GPT-2的训练计算量或8个H100 GPU）仍允许半数创新。

Conclusion: 计算限制对AI算法进步的阻碍有限。

Abstract: Algorithmic innovation in the pretraining of large language models has driven
a massive reduction in the total compute required to reach a given level of
capability. In this paper we empirically investigate the compute requirements
for developing algorithmic innovations. We catalog 36 pre-training algorithmic
innovations used in Llama 3 and DeepSeek-V3. For each innovation we estimate
both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware
utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements
each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps
on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to
dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress. Even stringent compute caps -- such
as capping total operations to the compute used to train GPT-2 or capping
hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs -- could still have allowed for half of the
cataloged innovations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于元学习的框架，用于5G/6G网络中的动态频谱分配，解决了传统深度强化学习样本复杂度高和安全风险的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习在频谱分配中样本复杂度高且存在安全风险，需要一种更高效、更安全的方法。

Method: 提出了三种元学习架构（MAML、RNN和注意力增强RNN），并在动态IAB环境中与非元学习DRL算法PPO进行对比。

Result: 注意力元学习代理峰值吞吐量达48 Mbps，优于PPO的10 Mbps；SINR和延迟违规减少50%以上，公平指数为0.7。

Conclusion: 元学习是复杂无线系统中智能控制的高效且安全的选择。

Abstract: The dynamic allocation of spectrum in 5G / 6G networks is critical to
efficient resource utilization. However, applying traditional deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is often infeasible due to its immense sample
complexity and the safety risks associated with unguided exploration, which can
cause severe network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a
meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy
and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement
three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML),
recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate
them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization
(PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB)
environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based
meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while
the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method
reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also
shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource
allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer
option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for time
series analytics, leveraging their massive parameters and the shared sequential
nature of textual and time series data. However, a cross-modality gap exists
between time series and textual data, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual
corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. In this tutorial, we
provide an up-to-date overview of LLM-based cross-modal time series analytics.
We introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into three groups
based on cross-modal modeling strategies, e.g., conversion, alignment, and
fusion, and then discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks.
In addition, we summarize several open challenges. This tutorial aims to expand
the practical application of LLMs in solving real-world problems in cross-modal
time series analytics while balancing effectiveness and efficiency.
Participants will gain a thorough understanding of current advancements,

Result: 在Continual ImageNet基准测试中，RDBP在可塑性和稳定性上达到或超过现有方法，同时降低计算成本。

Conclusion: RDBP为实际持续学习提供了实用解决方案，并为未来方法设定了明确基准。

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a
continuous stream of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, yet existing
approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability.
We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two
complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that
preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing
Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and
stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP
thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a
clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be
measured.

Abstract: Predicting soccer match outcomes is a challenging task due to the inherently
unpredictable nature of the game and the numerous dynamic factors influencing
results. While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep
learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective
player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.
However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of
interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling
match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous
Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep
learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a
multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player
dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a
Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through
heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a
global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which
constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model
historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which
jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match
outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a
large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly
outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide
valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation,
offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中平均性能提升约5%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GHPO为开发强大且稳健的推理模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language
models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However,
prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training
instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty
mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's
current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled
learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more
resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning
framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive
prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively
balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's
reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,
effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of
approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning
baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances
both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a
scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning
models.

<details>

Motivation: 高斯过程隐半马尔可夫模型（GP-HSMM）在处理大规模数据时，由于需要计算N×N核矩阵的逆，计算成本高昂。

Result: 在CMU运动捕捉数据集上，新方法的分割性能与传统方法相当，但速度提高了约278倍。

Conclusion: RFF-GP-HSMM是一种高效且性能优越的时间序列分割方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RFF-GP-HSMM, a fast unsupervised time-series
segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features (RFF) to address
the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model
(GP-HSMM). GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring
inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number
of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a
significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method
approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving
expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix.
Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance
comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster
segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points
and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face
computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention
mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper
proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network
specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach
introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention
mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest
neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$
to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory
regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet
extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with
1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3
seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds
high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared
to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method
improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

Abstract: A growing issue within conservation bioacoustics is the task of analysing the
vast amount of data generated from the use of passive acoustic monitoring
devices. In this paper, we present an alternative AI model which has the
potential to help alleviate this problem. Our model formulation addresses the
key issues encountered when using current AI models for bioacoustic analysis,
namely the: limited training data available; environmental impact, particularly
in energy consumption and carbon footprint of training and implementing these
models; and associated hardware requirements. The model developed in this work
uses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network
to store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify
species. Training is rapid ($3$\,ms), as only one representative signal is
required for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only
$5.4$\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat
recordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with
a small memory footprint of $144.09$\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low
computational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard
personal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing
devices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\%$ precision on the
dataset used to evaluate the model. In fact, we could not find a single case of
disagreement between model and manual identification via expert field guides.
Although a dataset of bat echolocation calls was chosen to demo this
first-of-its-kind AI model, trained on only two representative calls, the model
is not species specific. In conclusion, we propose an equitable AI model that
has the potential to be a game changer for fast, lightweight, sustainable,
transparent, explainable and accurate bioacoustic analysis.

Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human
cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems
with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical
generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement
symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of
radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a
group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining
characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder,
when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our
analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and
we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit
differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks
in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition
using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a
function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can
achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function,
and that learning speed is closely correlated with carry function structure. We
then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.

Abstract: Grounding language in complex perception (e.g. pixels) and action is a key
challenge when building situated agents that can interact with humans via
language. In past works, this is often solved via manual design of the language
grounding or by curating massive datasets relating language to elements of the
environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, a neurosymbolic framework for
grounding formal language from data, and eliciting behaviours by directly
tasking RL agents through this language. By virtue of data-driven learning, our
framework avoids the manual design of domain-specific elements like reward
functions or symbol detectors. By virtue of compositional formal language

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that Semantic Context (SC), leveraging descriptive
tool information, is a foundational component for robust tool orchestration.
Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a theoretical foundation
using contextual bandits, introducing SC-LinUCB and proving it achieves lower
regret and adapts favourably in dynamic action spaces. Second, we provide
parallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is
critical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning)
and non-stationary (robust adaptation) settings. Third, we propose the FiReAct
pipeline, and demonstrate on a benchmark with over 10,000 tools that SC-based
retrieval enables an LLM to effectively orchestrate over a large action space.
These findings provide a comprehensive guide to building more sample-efficient,
adaptive, and scalable orchestration agents.

*Motoki Omura,Yusuke Mukuta,Kazuki Ota,Takayuki Osa,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的离线强化学习方法，避免了对抗训练，提高了稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在数据收集成本高的场景（如机器人）中很有价值，但分布偏移问题可能导致不可靠的行为。现有方法多基于密度比，但本文提出使用Wasserstein距离来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用输入凸神经网络（ICNNs）建模最优传输映射，计算Wasserstein距离，无需对抗训练。

Result: 在D4RL基准数据集上表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过Wasserstein距离有效解决了分布偏移问题，且避免了对抗训练的不稳定性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a
static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data
collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is
distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset
distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To
mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many
existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the
$f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the
Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures
the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks
(ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the
Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding
adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates
comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL
benchmark dataset. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了对抗性遗忘问题，提出了一种保护模型性能的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型需要遗忘以满足法律要求或应对数据问题，但遗忘可能导致性能下降。恶意方可能利用遗忘请求破坏模型性能。

Method: 研究了对抗性遗忘现象，分析了影响因素，并提出了一种保护模型性能的方法。

Result: 发现对抗性遗忘的影响因素，并成功提出防护方法。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效保护模型性能，应对自发或恶意的遗忘行为。

Abstract: AI models need to be unlearned to fulfill the requirements of legal acts such
as the AI Act or GDPR, and also because of the need to remove toxic content,
debiasing, the impact of malicious instances, or changes in the data
distribution structure in which a model works. Unfortunately, removing
knowledge may cause undesirable side effects, such as a deterioration in model
performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial
unlearning, where a malicious party intentionally sends unlearn requests to
deteriorate the model's performance maximally. We show that this phenomenon and
the adversary's capabilities depend on many factors, primarily on the backbone
model itself and strategy/limitations in selecting data to be unlearned. The
main result of this work is a new method of protecting model performance from
these side effects, both in the case of unlearned behavior resulting from
spontaneous processes and adversary actions.

*Elisa Tsai,Haizhong Zheng,Atul Prakash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于类难度可分性的数据剪枝方法，通过引入类难度可分性系数（CDSC）和改进的采样策略，显著提升了数据剪枝的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法假设数据难度在类别间均匀分布，忽略了类别间难度差异，导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出类难度可分性系数（CDSC）衡量类别间难度差异，并设计类比例采样策略（如CCS-CP）。

Result: 在多个数据集上，类比例采样策略在极端剪枝率下表现稳定，性能下降显著低于传统方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模类难度可分性可提升数据剪枝的鲁棒性和泛化能力，尤其适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient
machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning
the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often
relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most
existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,
overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such
as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often
clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and
introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a
quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with
performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to
overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.
  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple
sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and
medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data
efficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a
class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows
remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and
recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best
method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and
4.11% in recall.
  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,
imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly
modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and
generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架将模拟、学习逻辑和编排耦合为单一系统，限制了模块化和可重用性。

Method: ClusterEnv采用DETACH模式，将reset()和step()操作卸载到远程工作器，同时保持学习集中化；提出AAPS机制以减少同步开销。

Result: 实验表明，AAPS在离散控制任务中实现了高样本效率，且权重更新次数显著减少。

Conclusion: ClusterEnv无缝集成到现有RL流程中，支持多种策略方法，且代码改动最小。

Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) workloads often requires distributing
environment simulation across compute clusters. Existing frameworks entangle
simulation, learning logic, and orchestration into monolithic systems, limiting
modularity and reusability. We present ClusterEnv, a lightweight,
learner-agnostic interface for distributed environment execution that mirrors
the Gymnasium API. ClusterEnv introduces the DETACH pattern, which decouples
simulation from training by offloading reset() and step() operations to remote
workers while keeping learning centralized. To address policy staleness in
distributed execution, we propose Adaptive Actor Policy Synchronization (AAPS),
a divergence-triggered update mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead
without sacrificing performance. ClusterEnv integrates cleanly into existing RL
pipelines, supports both on-policy and off-policy methods, and requires minimal
code changes. Experiments on discrete control tasks demonstrate that AAPS
achieves high sample efficiency with significantly fewer weight updates. Source

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示奖励函数中终端目标与工具目标的混淆如何导致强化学习性能下降，从而帮助改进奖励设计。

Method: 通过构建一个简单的例子，展示了终端目标与工具目标的混淆如何导致奖励函数的误用，并分析了其影响。

Result: 结果表明，即使是轻微的混淆也会导致优化后的奖励函数表现不佳，与真实目标不符。

Conclusion: 结论指出，奖励函数设计需明确区分终端目标与工具目标，以避免强化学习中的错位问题。

Abstract: Reward functions, learned or manually specified, are rarely perfect. Instead
of accurately expressing human goals, these reward functions are often
distorted by human beliefs about how best to achieve those goals. Specifically,
these reward functions often express a combination of the human's terminal
goals -- those which are ends in themselves -- and the human's instrumental
goals -- those which are means to an end. We formulate a simple example in
which even slight conflation of instrumental and terminal goals results in
severe misalignment: optimizing the misspecified reward function results in
poor performance when measured by the true reward function. This example
distills the essential properties of environments that make reinforcement
learning highly sensitive to conflation of instrumental and terminal goals. We
discuss how this issue can arise with a common approach to reward learning and
how it can manifest in real environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的异质性（混合分类和数值特征）使得对抗攻击难以定义不明显的修改，且传统梯度方法生成的对抗样本易偏离原始数据分布。

Method: 使用混合输入VAE将分类嵌入和数值特征整合到统一的潜在流形中，生成统计一致的对抗样本，并引入In-Distribution Success Rate（IDSR）作为衡量指标。

Result: 在六个公开数据集和三种模型架构上的评估表明，该方法生成的对抗样本具有更低的异常率和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 基于VAE的潜在空间扰动方法在表格数据上实现了更现实的对抗攻击，具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct
from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical
and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual
similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it
difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional
gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing
adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making
them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a
mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial
examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical
features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve
statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to
measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly
available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method
achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance
compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted
from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes
hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative
architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically
on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient
training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold
perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a
robust approach for practical deployment. The source code can be accessed

Result: 在多种室内环境中，GATE的平均定位误差和最大误差显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GATE通过创新的图表示和噪声建模，显著提升了室内定位的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart
environments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)
fingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its
compatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve
accuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but
they assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to
incorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of
real-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous
mobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS
readings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models
by encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal
relationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise
distributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded
accuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these
challenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive
graph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor
state-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to
mitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces
1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a
novel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind
spot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic
graph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor
spaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices
demonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and
1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor
localization frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经格兰杰因果模型需要为每个时间序列构建单独模型，计算成本高，且稀疏性惩罚削弱了捕捉复杂交互的能力。

Method: GRNGC仅需一个时间序列预测模型，通过L1正则化输入与输出之间的梯度来推断因果关系，支持多种架构（如KAN、MLP、LSTM）。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集（如DREAM、Lorenz-96、基因数据）上，GRNGC优于现有基线，显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: GRNGC是一种灵活高效的神经格兰杰因果模型，适用于复杂交互和真实世界应用。

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural
network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these
models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most
existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the
construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in
substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing
penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal
relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural
Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model
and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and
output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific
time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures
such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical
simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC
outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational
overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder
urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in
reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions
with limited access to medical resources and diagnostic facilities. Traditional
diagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease
risks, leading to adverse outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to
significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and speed of heart disease
diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines
classification models for heart disease detection and regression models for
risk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035
cases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an
additional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to
evaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random
Forest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on
real data and 97.6% on synthetic data. For regression tasks, Linear Regression
demonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic
datasets, respectively, with the lowest error metrics. Additionally,
Explainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the
models. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to
revolutionize heart disease diagnosis and risk prediction, thereby facilitating
early intervention and enhancing clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了样本效率，性能提升显著且成本可忽略。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex
decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a
substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer,
leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these
challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that
focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the
factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is
computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer,
effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments
across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and
SAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents
without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up
to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.

Motivation: 解决反向传播需要存储激活值和梯度消失/爆炸问题，提高学习性能和稳定性。

Method: 使用局部层损失和多维尺度配对距离原则，结合奖励驱动指导，在正向传播中训练每一层。

Result: 在常见强化学习基准测试中表现与反向传播方法相当，且更稳定、一致，在复杂环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法无需反向传播，减少了计算和存储需求，同时提升了性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on
backpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward
pass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error
signals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding
gradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a
novel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals
during the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,
layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from
multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This
method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed
during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and
storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy
gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this
backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their
classical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances
stability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance
especially in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fNIRS领域中的非线性、低信噪比和信号变异性对模型准确性提出了挑战，但激活函数对深度学习性能的影响尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 研究使用多种深度学习架构（包括fNIRSNet、AbsoluteNet、MDNN和shallowConvNet）评估传统和领域特定的激活函数，所有网络在相同数据集上训练和测试。

Result: 对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x）在某些架构中表现优于ReLU，且修改后的绝对函数（MAF）进一步验证了对称性的重要性。

Conclusion: 选择与fNIRS数据特性匹配的激活函数对提升模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks,
particularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),
where nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability
poses significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of
activation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain
remains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current
literature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific
activation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep
learning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,
MDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset
recorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks
were trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent
training parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions
such as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly
used functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the
architecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was
conducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further
supporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance
gains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation
functions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信道预测的参考信号分配方法（CPRS），通过联合优化信道预测和DM-RS分配，在不依赖CSI反馈的情况下提升数据吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模MIMO系统中，天线数量增加导致FDD系统的CSI反馈需求急剧上升，而现有研究在参考信号分配方面的优化不足。

Method: 提出CPRS方法，结合ViViT/CNN架构，将CSI矩阵视为序列图像数据，实现动态环境中的高效自适应传输。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在吞吐量上比基准策略提升了36.60%。

Conclusion: CPRS方法为减少反馈开销提供了一种有效解决方案，并验证了其在5G-Advanced标准中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling

using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSMPs的新框架，结合了学习到的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，用于从演示中准确获取周期性运动，并确保轨道稳定性和横向收缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Motion Primitives（DMPs）在捕获复杂周期性行为和任务间插值方面存在局限性，限制了其在实际任务（如运动和节奏工具使用）中的应用。

Method: 通过结合学习到的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，提出OSMPs框架，实现周期性运动的准确获取和稳定性保证。

Result: 实验验证了OSMPs在多种机器人平台上的有效性，优于现有基线方法（如扩散策略）。

Conclusion: OSMPs为周期性运动学习提供了稳定且通用的解决方案，扩展了机器人学习的应用范围。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时交互感知框架rt-RISeg，通过机器人交互和设计的体帧不变特征（BFIF）实现未见物体的分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法依赖大规模数据集训练，易过拟合静态视觉特征，泛化能力差。

Method: 基于交互视觉原理，提出rt-RISeg框架，利用机器人交互和体帧不变特征（BFIF）实时分割物体，无需预训练模型。

Result: 平均分割准确率比现有UOIS方法高27.5%，且分割结果可作为视觉基础模型的提示进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: rt-RISeg通过交互感知显著提升未见物体分割性能，并展示了与视觉基础模型的兼容性。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，优化社交机器人在多用户环境中的决策能力，通过新损失函数和数据集提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户环境中，社交机器人需理解上下文并决定何时及对谁回应，现有研究多关注单用户交互，无法满足需求。

Method: 采用Transformer多任务学习框架，引入两种新损失函数：约束活跃说话者以改进场景建模，引导选择针对机器人的回应。构建多用户HRI数据集。

Result: 模型在回应决策上表现优于现有启发式和单任务方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究推动了社交机器人在自然、上下文感知的多用户交互中的发展。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

Motivation: 传统导航系统在动态和非结构化环境中表现不佳，现有强化学习方法泛化能力差且仿真多样性不足。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型推理和条件变分自编码器，利用单样本示例和思维链提示策略实现场景理解。

Result: LE-Nav在真实导航试验和用户研究中表现优于现有方法，成功率和主观评分更高。

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过自适应超参数调优，显著提升了导航性能和社会接受度。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的3D几何重建因反射和折射等物理特性而具有挑战性，尤其在稀疏视图和动态环境中。

Method: TRAN-D通过分离透明物体与背景，优化对应高斯分布，并使用物体感知损失和物理模拟来减少伪影和提升重建精度。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中，TRAN-D比现有方法平均绝对误差降低39%，单图像更新时精度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体深度重建中表现出显著优势，适用于稀疏视图和动态环境。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Motivation: 许多飞行生物依赖视觉而非惯性传感器进行姿态控制，而飞行机器人通常依赖加速度计和陀螺仪。本文旨在探索仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法。

Method: 使用向下事件相机和循环卷积神经网络，通过监督学习训练网络，从事件流中估计姿态和旋转速率。

Result: 实验证明该方法可替代传统飞行控制中的惯性测量单元，且网络在不同环境中具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉飞行控制是未来微型飞行机器人自主飞行的有潜力方案。

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

Motivation: 探索LLM在电子设计自动化（EDA）领域的应用潜力，特别是在SMPS设计中，解决LLM无法直接理解SPICE仿真结果和多步骤设计过程的挑战。

Method: 提出SPICEAssistant框架，为LLM提供与SPICE模拟器交互的工具，使其能够灵活修改电路并评估影响。通过256个问题的基准测试评估性能。

Result: 仿真反馈有效提升了LLM的SMPS设计能力，仿真迭代次数增加进一步改善性能。SPICEAssistant比GPT-4o性能提升约38%。

Conclusion: SPICEAssistant框架通过工具接口解决了LLM在EDA中的局限性，显著提升了其在SMPS设计中的表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) show high performance across a
wide range of tasks in many domains of science. In the field of electronic
design automation (EDA), it is yet to be determined to what extent they are
capable to understand, adapt, and dimension electronic circuits. This paper
focuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design
on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Particular challenges for LLMs in this
context include their limited ability to interpret results from key simulation
tools like SPICE and the multi-step design process. To address these
challenges, we suggest SPICEAssistant, a framework that provides a broad
selection of tools to an LLM. The tools serve as an interface to SPICE,
allowing the LLM to interact flexibly with the simulator to estimate the impact
of its modifications to the circuit. To evaluate the performance of
SPICEAssistant, we defined a benchmark consisting of 256 questions testing the
ability to adapt circuit netlists to fulfil different SMPS design tasks. The
benchmarking results show that simulation feedback effectively improves SMPS
design capabilities of LLMs. An increasing number of simulation iterations
leads to enhanced performance. The SPICEAssistant framework significantly
outperforms the standalone LLM GPT-4o on the benchmark by approximately 38%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FSA的新型脉动阵列架构，通过SystolicAttention调度算法，将FlashAttention完全运行在单一脉动阵列中，显著提高了利用率，并减少了对外部向量单元的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于脉动阵列的加速器在执行FlashAttention时面临利用率低的问题，主要原因是频繁的数据交换和非矩阵操作的不适应性。

Method: 提出FSA架构和SystolicAttention调度算法，将FlashAttention操作映射到脉动阵列中，实现细粒度的元素级重叠。

Result: FSA在注意力FLOPs/s利用率上比AWS NeuronCore-v2和Google TPUv5e分别提高了1.77倍和4.83倍，且面积开销仅增加约10%。

Conclusion: FSA通过优化脉动阵列架构和调度算法，有效解决了FlashAttention在现有加速器上的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Transformer models rely heavily on scaled dot-product attention (SDPA),
typically implemented using the FlashAttention algorithm. However, current
systolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing
FlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for
consecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention
requires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.
  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units
result in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the
fact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not
well-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix
multiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register
file and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array
architecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely
within a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.
At the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps
FlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise
overlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the
original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.
  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against
state-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves
1.77x and 4.83x higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS
NeuronCore-v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only about 10% area
overhead.

Conclusion: CLS-DM不仅提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果，还可推广至其他跨模态转换任务，如文本到图像合成。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research

Result: 3D MIR方法能够高精度恢复3D信息，为半导体封装中的磁场图像重建设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习和物理驱动优化在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a
critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This
study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and
state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection
using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from
conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning
architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet,
DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT,
Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856
pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the
Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and
99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that
architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size,
with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also
addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training
requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the

that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural
images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the
texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the
strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training
framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM
captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss
helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation
to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We
demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed
GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection
from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by
3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by
0.6%. Source code and pre-trained models are available at:

*Hongbo Ye,Fenghe Tang,Peiang Zhao,Zhen Huang,Dexin Zhao,Minghao Bian,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为U-RWKV的新型框架，用于高效长距离建模的医学图像分割，解决了现有方法全局感受野有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的环境中，实现医疗图像分割的高效解决方案对医疗公平性至关重要。现有方法如U-Net及其变体因全局感受野有限，难以捕捉长距离依赖关系。

Method: U-RWKV结合了Recurrent Weighted Key-Value (RWKV)架构，提出Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module (DARM)和Stage-Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Module (SASE)，分别用于高效长距离建模和动态适应不同特征提取阶段。

Result: 实验表明，U-RWKV在计算效率高的同时实现了最先进的分割性能。

Conclusion: U-RWKV为资源受限环境中的高级医学影像技术提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet
high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in
resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often
suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their
ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,
a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)
architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)
computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the
Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan
mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional
bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational
efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature
extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic
relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,
offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging
technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at

Result: 在七种基线方法中，实现了96.7%的去除效率、0.31 kWh/m³能耗和14.2 g/m³ CO₂排放。

Conclusion: 方法在多种场景下表现稳健，但数据科学人员配备是主要障碍，未来将集成AutoML以解决可解释性问题。

Abstract: With increasing wastewater rates, achieving energy-neutral purification is
challenging. We introduce a coral-reef-inspired Swarm Interaction Network for
carbon-neutral wastewater treatment, combining morphogenetic abstraction with
multi-task carbon awareness. Scalability stems from linear token complexity,
mitigating the energy-removal problem. Compared with seven baselines, our
approach achieves 96.7\% removal efficiency, 0.31~kWh~m$^{-3}$ energy
consumption, and 14.2~g~m$^{-3}$ CO$_2$ emissions. Variance analysis
demonstrates robustness under sensor drift. Field scenarios--insular lagoons,
brewery spikes, and desert greenhouses--show potential diesel savings of up to
22\%. However, data-science staffing remains an impediment. Future work will
integrate AutoML wrappers within the project scope, although governance

Neural Networks (SNNs) are particularly promising due to their event-driven and
temporally sparse nature, making them well-suited for low-power Field

Result: BPU在MNIST和CIFAR-10上表现优异，ChessBench任务中轻量级GNN-BPU模型显著优于Transformer。

Conclusion: 生物启发架构在复杂认知任务中具有潜力，未来可扩展至更大规模的连接组。

Abstract: The complete connectome of the Drosophila larva brain offers a unique
opportunity to investigate whether biologically evolved circuits can support
artificial intelligence. We convert this wiring diagram into a Biological
Processing Unit (BPU), a fixed recurrent network derived directly from synaptic
connectivity. Despite its modest size 3,000 neurons and 65,000 weights between
them), the unmodified BPU achieves 98% accuracy on MNIST and 58% on CIFAR-10,
surpassing size-matched MLPs. Scaling the BPU via structured connectome
expansions further improves CIFAR-10 performance, while modality-specific
ablations reveal the uneven contributions of different sensory subsystems. On
the ChessBench dataset, a lightweight GNN-BPU model trained on only 10,000
games achieves 60% move accuracy, nearly 10x better than any size transformer.
Moreover, CNN-BPU models with ~2M parameters outperform parameter-matched
Transformers, and with a depth-6 minimax search at inference, reach 91.7%
accuracy, exceeding even a 9M-parameter Transformer baseline. These results
demonstrate the potential of biofidelic neural architectures to support complex
cognitive tasks and motivate scaling to larger and more intelligent connectomes
in future work.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate divergence measure is a critical aspect of machine
learning, as it directly impacts model performance. Among the most widely used,
we find the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, originally introduced in kinetic
theory as a measure of relative entropy between probability distributions. Just
as in machine learning, the ability to quantify the proximity of probability
distributions plays a central role in kinetic theory. In this paper, we present
a comparative review of divergence measures rooted in kinetic theory,
highlighting their theoretical foundations and exploring their potential
applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Traditional approaches for molecular imaging of Parkinson's disease (PD) in
vivo require radioactive isotopes, lengthy scan times, or deliver only low
spatial resolution. Recent advances in saturation transfer-based PD magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) have provided biochemical insights, although the image
contrast is semi-quantitative and nonspecific. Here, we combined a rapid
molecular MRI acquisition paradigm with deep learning based reconstruction for
multi-metabolite quantification of glutamate, mobile proteins, semisolid, and
mobile macromolecules in an acute MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. The quantitative
parameter maps are in general agreement with the histology and MR spectroscopy,
and demonstrate that semisolid magnetization transfer (MT), amide, and
aliphatic relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) proton volume fractions may
serve as PD biomarkers.

Conclusion: 随机纠缠配置方法具有鲁棒性和泛化性，能够显著提升量子机器学习模型的性能。

Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational
quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most
current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to
task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce
a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically
generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of
constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies
that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond
classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary
matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable
exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using
entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define
unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per
qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and
evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified
64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently
outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing
configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical
model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,
nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the
classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered
up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and
generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.

Conclusion: 该方法为发音错误检测提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations by
analyzing deviations between a user's original speech and their voice-cloned
counterpart with corrected pronunciation. We hypothesize that regions with
maximal acoustic deviation between the original and cloned utterances indicate
potential mispronunciations. Our method leverages recent advances in voice
cloning to generate a synthetic version of the user's voice with proper
pronunciation, then performs frame-by-frame comparisons to identify problematic
segments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
in pinpointing specific pronunciation errors without requiring predefined
phonetic rules or extensive training data for each target language.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate leveraging cross-attention control for
efficient audio editing within auto-regressive models. Inspired by image
editing methodologies, we develop a Prompt-to-Prompt-like approach that guides
edits through cross and self-attention mechanisms. Integrating a
diffusion-based strategy, influenced by Auffusion, we extend the model's
functionality to support refinement edits, establishing a baseline for
prompt-guided audio editing. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach
by incorporating MUSICGEN, a pre-trained frozen auto-regressive model, and
propose three editing mechanisms, based on Replacement, Reweighting, and
Refinement of the attention scores. We employ commonly-used music-specific
evaluation metrics and a human study, to gauge time-varying controllability,
adherence to global text cues, and overall audio realism. The automatic and
human evaluations indicate that the proposed combination of prompt-to-prompt
guidance with autoregressive generation models significantly outperforms the
diffusion-based baseline in terms of melody, dynamics, and tempo of the
generated audio. Our code is available at https://github.com/billsioros/EditGen

Conclusion: 该框架在支持家庭互动正向转变方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that
conventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental
expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional
expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,
often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is
difficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these
latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support
for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese
parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on
ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a
Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes
dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,
describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual
attributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these
outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert
agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable
feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show
that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate
accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.
Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited
signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the
framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family
interactions.

Motivation: 现代SDN和NFV环境中，SFC管理和VNF放置是关键挑战，传统DRL方法因依赖结构化数据和固定规则而受限。

Method: 结合LiLM（BART和FLAN-T5）与RDB，通过语言模型解析网络数据并支持多样化查询，指导DRL模型。

Result: FLAN-T5表现优于BART（测试损失更低、准确率更高、处理时间更短），且与SQLCoder相比，准确率相当但处理时间减少96%。

Conclusion: LiLM-RDB-SFC方法显著提升了SFC管理的效率和适应性，FLAN-T5是更优的语言模型选择。

Abstract: Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual
Network Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
environments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for
dynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and
fixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly
under unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a
novel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational
Database (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient
SFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and
Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5
(FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to
SFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate
that FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to
0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time
(2h 2min compared to 2h 38min). Moreover, when compared to the large language
model SQLCoder, FLAN-T5 matches the accuracy of SQLCoder while cutting
processing time by 96% (SQLCoder: 54 h 43 min; FLAN-T5: 2 h 2 min).

Abstract: The increasing need for robustness, reliability, and determinism in wireless
networks for industrial and mission-critical applications is the driver for the
growth of new innovative methods. The study presented in this work makes use of
machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in
terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to
adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for
industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and
long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi
setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction
accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery
ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although
slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU
usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded
and industrial systems.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by
rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This
attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP
researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience.
Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and

recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public
understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth,
and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research
and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples.
The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the

Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual

of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are
regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level
performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3
Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the
textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each
model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the
answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert
judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt
wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future
work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive
prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the
outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might
overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a
virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific
limitations that need solutions.

Abstract: This shared task has aimed to assess pedagogical abilities of AI tutors
powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on evaluating the quality of
tutor responses aimed at student's mistake remediation within educational
dialogues. The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate
the AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification,
precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback
actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and
effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the
tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all
tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human
annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still
significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four
pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34
(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class
problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching
96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the
shared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their
performance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly
available to support future research in this critical domain.

*Jabari Kwesi,Jiaxun Cao,Riya Manchanda,Pardis Emami-Naeini*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户在使用通用LLM聊天机器人进行心理健康支持时的隐私和安全问题，发现用户存在误解和风险意识不足，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地依赖LLM聊天机器人进行情感支持，但缺乏对其隐私和安全问题的实证研究，尤其是通用LLM聊天机器人的使用。

Method: 通过21次半结构化访谈，分析美国用户对LLM聊天机器人的隐私和安全态度。

Result: 用户误将LLM的共情能力等同于人类的责任感，且低估了情感披露的风险。提出了“无形脆弱性”概念。

Conclusion: 建议采取措施更有效地保护用户在使用通用LLM聊天机器人时的心理健康信息披露。

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly relying on large language model (LLM)-enabled
conversational agents for emotional support. While prior research has examined
privacy and security issues in chatbots specifically designed for mental health
purposes, these chatbots are overwhelmingly "rule-based" offerings that do not
leverage generative AI. Little empirical research currently measures users'
privacy and security concerns, attitudes, and expectations when using
general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots to manage and improve mental health.
Through 21 semi-structured interviews with U.S. participants, we identified
critical misconceptions and a general lack of risk awareness. Participants
conflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like
accountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these
chatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures
with a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of "intangible
vulnerability," where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued
compared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or
location-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard
user mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more
effectively.

TL;DR: 社交机器人因其AI和先进传感能力在美国消费者中受欢迎，但也带来更大的安全和隐私风险，需研究用户需求以指导设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交机器人作为智能家居的进化，其数据收集和交互能力增加了安全和隐私威胁，需了解用户需求以指导早期商业化设计。

Method: 通过19次半结构化访谈，识别用户对安全和隐私的主要担忧。

Result: 用户关注透明度、易用性和隐私控制，教育应用担心误导信息，医疗应用担心可靠性，还担忧数据推断问题。

Conclusion: 用户期望明确的隐私控制、数据收集提示和情境适当的功能，这对社交机器人设计至关重要。

Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities,
social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These
robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices.
However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic
features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a
more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data
linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their
homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and
concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in
the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19
semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy
concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy
controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants
worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about
the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the
data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants
expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and
context-appropriate functionality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于泰勒展开的局部特征归因方法TaylorPODA，通过引入精确性、联邦性和零差异三个公理，并结合任务适应性，为不透明模型提供理论支持的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后模型无关解释方法缺乏系统框架量化特征贡献，需要更严谨的理论基础。

Method: 基于泰勒展开框架，提出TaylorPODA方法，结合精确性、联邦性、零差异和适应性公理。

Result: TaylorPODA在实证评估中表现优于基线方法，提供理论支持且可视化友好的解释。

Conclusion: TaylorPODA为不透明模型的可靠部署提供了理论更坚实的解释方法。

Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for
opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input
features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for
quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor
expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local
attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision",
"federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific
attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor
expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an
additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with
task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth
explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves
competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and
visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the
trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger
theoretical grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决传统BSDEs理论中全局Lipschitz条件的限制，将其扩展到适用于常见神经网络架构（如ReLU激活函数）的局部Lipschitz条件，从而为数据驱动的模糊性建模提供数学基础。

Method: 通过定义神经期望算子作为BSDEs的解，并证明其在局部Lipschitz条件和二次增长下的适定性。此外，通过架构设计实现凸性等关键公理性质。

Result: 提出了适用于神经网络的BSDEs理论框架，并扩展至完全耦合的前向-后向SDE系统及大交互粒子系统的渐近分析，证明了LLN和CLT。

Conclusion: 为模糊性下的数据驱动建模提供了数学基础，并展示了神经网络设计如何满足理论条件。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textbf{Measure Learning}, a paradigm for modeling
ambiguity via non-linear expectations. We define Neural Expectation Operators
as solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) whose
drivers are parameterized by neural networks. The main mathematical
contribution is a rigorous well-posedness theorem for BSDEs whose drivers
satisfy a local Lipschitz condition in the state variable $y$ and quadratic
growth in its martingale component $z$. This result circumvents the classical
global Lipschitz assumption, is applicable to common neural network
architectures (e.g., with ReLU activations), and holds for exponentially
integrable terminal data, which is the sharp condition for this setting. Our
primary innovation is to build a constructive bridge between the abstract, and
often restrictive, assumptions of the deep theory of quadratic BSDEs and the
world of machine learning, demonstrating that these conditions can be met by
concrete, verifiable neural network designs. We provide constructive methods
for enforcing key axiomatic properties, such as convexity, by architectural
design. The theory is extended to the analysis of fully coupled
Forward-Backward SDE systems and to the asymptotic analysis of large
interacting particle systems, for which we establish both a Law of Large
Numbers (propagation of chaos) and a Central Limit Theorem. This work provides
the foundational mathematical framework for data-driven modeling under
ambiguity.

TL;DR: SQLord是一个企业级NL2SQL框架，通过数据反向生成和查询分解方法解决现有框架在复杂业务逻辑和领域数据不足的问题，并引入GPT-Judge评估框架，在离线和在线测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL框架在复杂业务逻辑和领域数据不足时表现不佳，且评估方法依赖标注数据和可执行数据库环境，难以适应实际场景。

Method: SQLord采用数据反向生成方法生成标注数据，提出复杂查询的分解方法，并设计GPT-Judge评估框架（EXE、QSE、SSE）。

Result: 离线测试显著优于基线，在线准确率持续超过90%，并在全球最大B2B电商平台成功应用。

Conclusion: SQLord在复杂实际场景中表现出色，解决了现有框架的局限性。

Abstract: Transforming natural language into SQL queries (NL2SQL) is crucial for
data-driven business applications. Existing frameworks, trained on open-source
datasets, struggle with complex business logic and lack domain-specific data
for fine-tuning. Additionally, evaluation methods often require annotated data
and executable database environments, which are scarce in real-world scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose SQLord, an enterprise-level NL2SQL
framework. First, SQLord introduces a data reverse generation approach to
convert raw SQL statements into annotated data for supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). Second, it proposes a decomposition method for complex queries using an
automated workflow generator. Additionally, SQLord features a comprehensive
GPT-Judge evaluation framework, including Execution Evaluation (EXE), Query-SQL
Evaluation (QSE), and SQL-SQL Evaluation (SSE), tailored to diverse scenarios.
Offline tests significantly outperform state of the art baselines, and online
accuracy consistently exceeds 90, highlighting SQLord's advantages and
effectiveness in complex real world scenarios. SQLord has been successfully
applied across multiple scenarios on the world's largest B2B e-commerce
platform.

Motivation: 研究扩散模型中毒攻击对文本反转的影响，揭示攻击的机制并提出防御方法。

Method: 提出Semantic Sensitivity Maps可视化方法，分析DMs的学习行为；设计SZT防御机制，包括JPEG压缩、限制高时间步训练和损失掩码。

Result: 实验表明SZT显著提升了TI对毒攻击的鲁棒性，生成质量优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: SZT是一种有效的防御机制，能显著增强扩散模型对毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion
models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning
attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for
DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for
visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify
and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across
timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias
and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we
observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept
regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these
insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism
comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency
poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid
adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain
learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning
methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all
poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published
defenses. Code: www.github.com/JStyborski/Diff_Lab Data:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理易受弹出式环境注入攻击影响，现有防御方法成本高或效果差，需系统性解决注意力偏差问题。

Method: 研究攻击对注意力行为的影响，发现层间注意力差异模式，提出LaSM机制选择性放大关键层注意力模块。

Result: LaSM在12种弹出扰动和4种模型上均提升防御成功率，结合提示警报后鲁棒性超98%。

Conclusion: 注意力偏差是MLLM代理的核心漏洞，LaSM通过层间选择性调制有效解决。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong decision-making abilities in
screen-based interaction tasks. However, they remain highly vulnerable to
pop-up-based environmental injection attacks, where malicious visual elements
divert model attention and lead to unsafe or incorrect actions. Existing
defense methods either require costly retraining or perform poorly under
inductive interference. In this work, we systematically study how such attacks
alter the attention behavior of GUI agents and uncover a layer-wise attention
divergence pattern between correct and incorrect outputs. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{LaSM}, a \textit{Layer-wise Scaling Mechanism} that
selectively amplifies attention and MLP modules in critical layers. LaSM
improves the alignment between model saliency and task-relevant regions without
additional training. Extensive experiments across 12 types of pop-up
perturbations and 4 different model backbones show that LaSM consistently
enhances the defense success rate. When combined with prompt-level alerts, LaSM
achieves over 98\% robustness even under strong inductive attacks. Our findings
reveal that attention misalignment is a core vulnerability in MLLM agents and
can be effectively addressed through selective layer-wise modulation.

Abstract: Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in
how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity
methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and
intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and
software tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling
adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in
autonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize
attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect
remains between theory and practical implementation.
  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to
bridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into
real-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and
coordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge
classical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static
payoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational
realities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel
solution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now
be modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.
  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and
cybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,
Bayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM
agents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed
reasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and
coordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,
and adaptive cyber systems.

Conclusion: 自适应信号处理与深度学习结合为IoT异常检测提供了强大且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge
in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly
detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model
known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks.
Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the
temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional
fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the
data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling
more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths
of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering
a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on
three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and
IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating
adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to
achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network
landscapes.

Abstract: Phishing remains a pervasive and growing threat, inflicting heavy economic
and reputational damage. While machine learning has been effective in real-time
detection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large,
high-quality datasets and benchmarks. In addition to poor-quality due to
challenges in data collection, existing datasets suffer from leakage and
unrealistic base rates, leading to overly optimistic performance results. In
this paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of
phishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public
datasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher
quality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data
points. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets
specifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage,
increasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base
rates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple
solution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We
believe the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic,
standardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing
detection. The datasets and benchmarks are available on Hugging Face

Conclusion: MalCodeAI为智能、可解释且以开发者为中心的软件安全解决方案提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber threats and the limitations of traditional
vulnerability detection tools necessitate novel approaches for securing
software systems. We introduce MalCodeAI, a language-agnostic, multi-stage AI
pipeline for autonomous code security analysis and remediation. MalCodeAI
combines code decomposition and semantic reasoning using fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct models, optimized through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
within the MLX framework, and delivers scalable, accurate results across 14
programming languages. In Phase 1, the model achieved a validation loss as low
as 0.397 for functional decomposition and summarization of code segments after
200 iterations, 6 trainable layers, and a learning rate of 2 x 10^(-5). In
Phase 2, for vulnerability detection and remediation, it achieved a best
validation loss of 0.199 using the same number of iterations and trainable
layers but with an increased learning rate of 4 x 10^(-5), effectively
identifying security flaws and suggesting actionable fixes. MalCodeAI supports
red-hat-style exploit tracing, CVSS-based risk scoring, and zero-shot
generalization to detect complex, zero-day vulnerabilities. In a qualitative
evaluation involving 15 developers, the system received high scores in
usefulness (mean 8.06/10), interpretability (mean 7.40/10), and readability of
outputs (mean 7.53/10), confirming its practical value in real-world
development workflows. This work marks a significant advancement toward
intelligent, explainable, and developer-centric software security solutions.
