Current approaches typically\nmerge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing\nphenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and\ndegraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new\ntask, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our\ndataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised\nmulti-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9\nsentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in\nexisting datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS\nimproves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,\nhigh inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and\nsmaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose\nDiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a\nsecond PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation\noverhead.

Specifically, we cluster\nneuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form\nrepresentative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify\na new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.\nAdditionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the\nbias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable\nOOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning\narchitectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and\nGastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNERO\u7684\u65b0\u578bOOD\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347OOD\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u68c0\u6d4bOOD\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6f5c\u5728\u8bef\u8bca\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349OOD\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "NERO\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f62\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u7f29\u653e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8303\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNERO\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NERO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model\nreliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.\nTo understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in\nmodel outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis\nrequires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing\noccurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the\nabsence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of\nmetrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of\nmetrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these\nlimitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret\ndataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised\nCompression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret\nrepresentation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to\nidentify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze\nactivation patterns.

To enhance the quality of generated 4D\nHOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to\nextract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention\nto effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.\nExperimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the\npublicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI\ngeneration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenHOI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b34D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HOI\uff09\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a00\u758f3D\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4D\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f464D HOI\u5408\u6210\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) Object-AnchorNet\u91cd\u5efa\u7a00\u758f3D HOI\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2) ContactDM\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u62104D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a5\u89e6\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728OMOMO\u548c3D-FUTURE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4D HOI\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "GenHOI\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a214D HOI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76844D HOI\u5408\u6210\u3002"}}

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods.

Using the benchmarking\ncapabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance\nthat matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than\na dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks.

Quantitative Structural\nModel (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree\nstructural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant\nlimitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on\nhigh-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also\nrequire multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical\ndeployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables\nend-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative\ngraph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree\nsegmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through\ndedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology\nreasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf\nconditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and\ndata sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results\ndemonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in\nleaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with\npartial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the\nproposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,\nnon-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on\nspecialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to\nTLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,\nend-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales.

Existing SD-based\nReal-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,\nresulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to\neffectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the\nlow-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining\nthe extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA\nLearning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion\nmodel, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module\nto aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a\nConsistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from\ndegraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules\nand train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with\nthe temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases\nalternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent\nand detail-rich outputs.

Drawing on international news\narticles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol\ninsurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we\nconstruct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving\ndiscourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram\nvia a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and\npersistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic\ndisruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major\ngeopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected\ncomponents) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative\nstructure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag\npattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order\nmotif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An\nexception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads\nH0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse\nadjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse\nnarrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a\nmathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points\nand directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge\nof specific events.

A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL\nreward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

We introduce \\textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based\nReward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency\nand output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a\nmargin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to\nidentify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second\nstage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or\nexhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded\nevaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence\ncontinuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions\nthat are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and\nexplanatory, while achieving over 4$\\times$ speedup compared to existing\nvalue-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA\nMistral-7B, \\textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger\nunseen model}.

Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal\nembedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\\Theta(\\sqrt{width})$,\nsurprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the\nliterature, and different from the $\\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\\mu$P.\nWe conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model\nfrom scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the\nembedding LR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u4ecb\u4e8e\u03bcP\u548cLV\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u03bcP\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u7684LV\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728LV\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0e\u9690\u85cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5e94\u7ea6\u4e3a\u0398(\u221awidth)\uff0c\u4e0e\u03bcP\u7684\u0398(width)\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u5728LV\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x.

Developed\nin collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative\nstudy with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three\nkey tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and\nsafety.

S3PO adopts recurrent\nmodelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques\nlike alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss\nfunction addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most\nstate-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\\deg}~specific\nsuper-resolution models on 360{\\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study\nis presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen\narchitectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5S3PO\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86360VDS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVSR\u6a21\u578b\u5728360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u5728VR\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f20\u7edfVSR\u6280\u672f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS3PO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7403\u5f62\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "S3PO\u5728360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4f20\u7edfVSR\u6a21\u578b\u548c360\u5ea6\u4e13\u7528\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "S3PO\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety\nconcerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite\nsubstantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models\ncan still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -\neven when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of\nsafety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building\non this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank\nExtrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety\nsubspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks.

We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and\npropose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well\nas the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university\ncampus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three\nscenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a\ncrowded street.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u4eba\u58eb\uff08VIPs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6237\u5916\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u822a\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u4eba\u58eb\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GPS\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591aDNN\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548cVIP\u7684\u907f\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6821\u56ed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff08\u4eba\u884c\u9053\u3001\u505c\u8f66\u533a\u3001\u62e5\u6324\u8857\u9053\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u6237\u5916\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated.

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training\nwith numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets.

We\noptimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image\npairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are\nused for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and\nevaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new\nbenchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark\nconsists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with\ndifferent styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,\nexpressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we\nselect only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used\nfor inference.

Unlike traditional\nAI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the\nchallenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We\nempirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the\nMetropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference\nmechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention\nnaming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,\nalways-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that\nhuman-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization\naccuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared\nsign system.

However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass\nthe retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce\nRetrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects\nsuch behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal\nimpact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,\nrequires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single\nadditional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the\nKL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the\nPrompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result\noutperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping\nlatency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.
