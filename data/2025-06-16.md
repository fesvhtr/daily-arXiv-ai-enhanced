<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLaVA-NeXT-interleave在多模态任务中的性能，并验证DCI连接器对模型性能的影响。

Method: 在22个数据集上测试LLaVA-NeXT-interleave的标准版和DCI增强版，比较它们在多模态任务中的表现。

Result: 标准模型在视觉任务（如VISION、NLVR2）中表现最佳，DCI版本在语义连贯性任务（如MIT-States_PropertyCoherence）中更强。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型与即插即用技术（如DCI）在多模态任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based
Understanding and Interactive Multi-Modal Communication. Secondly, we add the
Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and
compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and
SlideVQA. Our results highlight the potential of combining powerful foundation
models with plug-and-play techniques for Interleave tasks. The code is

TL;DR: EfficientQuant是一种针对混合模型的结构感知后训练量化方法，显著降低延迟且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模型在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但资源消耗大，难以在边缘设备部署。后训练量化（PTQ）在混合模型中的应用有限。

Method: 提出EfficientQuant，对卷积块采用均匀量化，对Transformer块采用对数量化。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上实现2.5倍至8.7倍的延迟降低，精度损失极小，边缘设备上表现高效。

Conclusion: EfficientQuant实用性强，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

### [3] [Adaptive Object Detection with ESRGAN-Enhanced Resolution & Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11122)
*Divya Swetha K,Ziaul Haque Choudhury,Hemanta Kumar Bhuyan,Biswajit Brahma,Nilayam Kumar Kamila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合ESRGAN和Faster R-CNN的方法，用于从低分辨率图像中提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低分辨率图像中的目标检测性能较差，需要一种方法在提升图像质量的同时实现高效检测。

Method: 使用ESRGAN作为预处理步骤增强图像质量，再将增强后的图像输入Faster R-CNN进行目标检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率图像上的检测性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像质量不稳定的场景提供了可靠的解决方案，平衡了图像增强和目标检测的效率。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

### [4] [Technical Report for Argoverse2 Scenario Mining Challenges on Iterative Error Correction and Spatially-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11124)
*Yifei Chen,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefAV框架通过LLM将自然语言查询转换为可执行代码以挖掘自动驾驶场景，但存在代码错误和参数不准确问题。本文提出迭代代码生成和专用提示工程改进方法，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的代码运行时错误和复杂空间关系参数解释不准确的问题，提升自动驾驶场景挖掘的可靠性。

Method: 引入故障容忍的迭代代码生成机制和专用提示工程，优化LLM生成代码的准确性和空间关系函数的应用。

Result: 在Argoverse 2验证集上，使用多种LLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Gemini 2.5 Pro）均取得性能提升，HOTA-Temporal得分达52.37。

Conclusion: 提出的技术显著提高了场景挖掘的可靠性和精度，为自动驾驶系统开发提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

### [5] [Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126)
*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于StarDist算法的铁矿石球团分类方法，用于检测最终产品的质量违规，并改进了物理尺寸测量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统算法在密集和不稳定环境中无法准确识别和分析物体，需要开发一种新方法以提高铁矿石球团的质量分类和尺寸测量精度。

Method: 利用StarDist算法对物体进行分割、轮廓确定、分类和物理尺寸测量，特别针对球团的尺寸分布和质量分类。

Result: 提出了一种能够检测平滑边界物体的新方法，显著提高了物理尺寸测量的准确性，并改进了球团尺寸分布的分析。

Conclusion: 通过StarDist算法，本研究为复杂的球团分类和测量问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

### [6] [Segment This Thing: Foveated Tokenization for Efficient Point-Prompted Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11131)
*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT是一种高效的图像分割模型，通过聚焦输入图像和使用可变分辨率补丁标记化，显著减少计算成本，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高图像分割的效率，避免通过减小模型规模来提升效率的传统方法，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 使用聚焦输入图像和可变分辨率补丁标记化技术，减少图像标记数量，降低计算成本。

Result: STT在保持分割性能的同时显著提高了效率，能够在消费级硬件上以交互帧率运行。

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且性能优越的图像分割工具，适用于增强现实和机器人应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

### [7] [Gender Fairness of Machine Learning Algorithms for Pain Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11132)
*Dylan Green,Yuting Shang,Jiaee Cheong,Yang Liu,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于机器学习和深度学习的疼痛检测模型在性别公平性上的表现，发现尽管ViT模型准确率最高，但所有模型均存在性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动疼痛检测在医疗领域潜力巨大，但算法在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性研究不足。

Method: 使用UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database，比较传统ML算法（L SVM、RBF SVM）和DL方法（CNN、ViT）的性能与公平性。

Result: ViT准确率最高，但所有模型均表现出性别偏见。

Conclusion: 准确性与公平性之间存在权衡，需采用公平性技术减少医疗系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

### [8] [Monocular 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Implicit Camera Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11133)
*Christos Pantazopoulos,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从2D关键点估计3D手部关节的优化流程，无需相机参数，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单色图像中3D手部关节估计的挑战，如深度信息缺失、遮挡和相机参数需求。

Method: 采用关键点对齐步骤和指尖损失函数，避免依赖相机参数。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中表现优异，对野外图像处理鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需相机参数的情况下，实现了与现有技术相媲美的性能。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

### [9] [ContextLoss: Context Information for Topology-Preserving Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11134)
*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数ContextLoss（CLoss），通过考虑拓扑错误的完整上下文来提升图像分割的拓扑正确性，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构的拓扑（如血管、膜或道路）至关重要，因为拓扑错误可能严重影响实际应用（如导航）。现有方法未能充分利用拓扑错误的上下文信息。

Method: 提出CLoss损失函数，利用关键像素掩码中的完整上下文信息来改进拓扑正确性，并设计了两种直观的指标验证连通性改进。

Result: 在多个公开数据集和自建的3D纳米成像数据集上，CLoss显著提升了拓扑感知指标的性能，修复了比现有方法多44%的缺失连接。

Conclusion: CLoss通过引入上下文信息有效提升了拓扑正确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

*Paul Couairon,Loick Chambon,Louis Serrano,Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard,Matthieu Cord,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR是一种轻量级且灵活的特征上采样器，通过注意力模块提升视觉特征的空间分辨率，无需高分辨率监督即可泛化到更高输出尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率空间特征输出需要上采样以满足下游任务的高分辨率需求。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块，利用空间特征变换（SFT）调制，促进高分辨率查询与语义丰富的低分辨率键之间的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能有效恢复细粒度空间细节，并在多种下游任务中优于现有上采样方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR是一种高效的特征上采样解决方案，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文展示了如何利用基于大型语言模型（LLM）的Agentic AI方法，通过自然语言提示自主构建计算机视觉系统，并在医学图像分析中实现高效的任务分解和工具配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉应用的开发和工具配置通常需要数据科学家手动完成，效率较低。本研究旨在探索Agentic AI方法能否通过自然语言提示自主完成这些任务，提高自动化水平。

Method: 研究扩展了开源Cognitive AI环境SimpleMind（SM），结合基于LLM的Agent（使用OpenManus实现），通过自然语言提示自动分解任务并生成工具配置文件（YAML格式），随后自主执行训练和推理脚本。

Result: 在50张胸部X光图像上，系统自动配置、训练和测试，取得了肺部、心脏和肋骨分割的平均Dice分数分别为0.96、0.82和0.83。

Conclusion: 研究表明，Agentic AI能够自主完成传统上由数据科学家执行的计算机视觉任务规划和工具配置，展现了其在自动化应用开发中的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

### [12] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半监督语义分割框架，通过模糊伪标签、不确定性动态加权、自适应类别平衡和轻量对比正则化，解决了现有方法在伪标签利用、类别不平衡和不确定性处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督语义分割在利用未标记数据时面临伪标签利用不足、类别不平衡偏差加剧和预测不确定性忽视等问题。

Method: 提出四个核心组件：模糊伪标签保留软类别分布；不确定性动态加权通过熵调整像素贡献；自适应类别平衡动态调整损失；轻量对比正则化优化特征嵌入。

Result: 在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，尤其在少数类和模糊区域的分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将不确定性转化为学习资源，有效提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing
AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on
teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time
data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights
and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual
dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review
dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National
Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and
its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual
workloads and encourages constructive reflection. Although the current version
does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

*Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Wang Liao,Jiaqi Yang,Zerong zheng,Weihong Zeng,Han Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman框架通过偏好优化和分治训练策略，优化了人类视频生成中运动自然性与视觉保真度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的人类视频生成在运动自然性和视觉保真度之间存在权衡问题，难以同时优化。

Method: 提出AlignHuman框架，结合偏好优化和分治策略，利用时间步分段偏好优化（TPO）和两个专用LoRA模块，分别优化运动动态和视觉保真度。

Result: 实验表明，AlignHuman显著提升了基线性能，减少了推理时的NFEs（从100降至30），速度提升3.3倍，且生成质量几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过分治策略和偏好优化，有效解决了人类视频生成中的运动与保真度权衡问题，同时提升了效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.
Our dataset and code, aiming to catalyze multimodal medical AI research and
establish a robust foundation for 3D medical visual understanding, are publicly

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D在物理AI领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决在无标签数据的情况下，如何从EEG和图像数据中恢复心理目标的问题，此前该问题仅在标签数据下被探索过。

Method: 方法是通过CURSOR算法，利用自校准技术学习恢复未知心理目标，无需标签数据或预训练解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明，CURSOR能够预测与人类感知判断相关的图像相似度分数，并利用这些分数对未知心理目标进行排序，还能生成与目标难以区分的新刺激。

Conclusion: 结论是CURSOR在无标签数据的情况下，成功实现了心理目标的恢复和生成，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Motivation: 现有视频字幕评估基准存在关键问题，如关键点创建不足或同质化、数据创建成本高、评估范围有限。

Method: 提出AutoCaption框架，通过MCTS迭代生成多样化描述句子，全面覆盖视频内容细节。

Result: 构建了MCTS-VCB基准，评估了20多个MLLMs，Gemini-1.5-Pro表现最佳（F1=71.2）。使用AutoCaption数据微调的InternVL2.5-8B在MCTS-VCB和DREAM-1K上分别提升25.0%和16.3%。

Conclusion: AutoCaption能有效全面评估MLLMs的视频字幕能力，并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Abstract: Retrieving accurate details from documents is a crucial task, especially when
handling a combination of scanned images and native digital formats. This
document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files

traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced

Motivation: 理解人类社交行为（如情绪识别和社交动态）是一个重要但具挑战性的问题，现有LLMs局限于文本领域，无法捕捉非语言线索的作用。

Method: 提出新任务“视觉社会-语用推理”，构建高质量数据集，并测试多个VLMs的性能。

Result: 发现VLMs在视觉社会-语用推理任务中存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交推理方面仍有改进空间，需进一步研究以填补这一差距。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning

Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings

Result: 在多种医学影像模态中验证，测试时扩展策略显著提升诊断准确性，且无偏提示提高了LLM生成诊断的可靠性。

Conclusion: 零样本框架有效增强LLMs在医学影像诊断中的推理能力，为临床决策提供可靠支持。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Motivation: 现有图学习方法无法精确定位神经退行性病变的脑区，且多模态脑图模型计算复杂度高，限制了实际应用。

Result: 实验表明，BrainMAP在计算效率上优于现有方法，且预测准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精准识别提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，需要更有效的车辆速度检测方法。

Method: 使用经过微调的YOLOv11模型，训练了近800张鸟瞰图，并评估了无人机高度、ROI距离和车速对检测的影响。

Result: 模型在MAE为0.97 mph和MSE为0.94 mph²时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型在车辆速度检测和分类中表现出高效性。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境动态变化，传统方法难以同时捕捉空间和时间动态，因此需要新的数据集和模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入STRIDE数据集，将360度全景图像转化为观察、状态和动作节点；开发TARDIS模型，通过自回归框架整合时空动态。

Result: TARDIS在可控图像合成、指令跟随、自主控制和地理定位等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRIDE和TARDIS为开发具备时空理解能力的通用智能体提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个全球分布的森林地上生物量（AGB）估计数据集，用于评估地理空间基础模型（Geo-FMs）的性能，并展示了Geo-FMs在像素级回归任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集多局限于分割或分类任务，且地理覆盖范围有限，无法全面评估Geo-FMs。因此，需要一个新的数据集来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过结合EnMAP卫星的高光谱影像（HSI）和GEDI激光雷达的AGB密度估计，创建了一个覆盖七大洲的像素级回归任务数据集。

Result: 实验表明，Geo-FMs在某些情况下可以超越基线U-Net模型，尤其是在微调编码器时。性能差异还取决于区域数据集大小和Vision Transformer的token patch大小。

Conclusion: 该数据集的发布将促进Geo-FMs在高光谱影像应用中的开发和评估，并支持对地理偏见和泛化能力的研究。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有数据集在妇科腹腔镜手术中规模小、任务单一或注释不足，限制了全面工作流分析的实用性。

Method: 引入GynSurg数据集，提供丰富的多任务注释，并基于标准化训练协议对最先进模型进行基准测试。

Result: GynSurg展示了高质量和多功能性，支持动作识别、语义分割、手术文档记录和新颖手术见解的发现。

Conclusion: GynSurg的公开发布将加速妇科腹腔镜手术领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C-reweight的无失真水印方法，用于解决图像生成模型中的重标记不匹配问题，提升图像的真实性和可检测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像生成模型的快速发展带来了滥用风险（如深度伪造、钓鱼攻击等），需要有效的真实性验证机制。传统水印技术因重标记不匹配问题难以直接应用于图像生成模型。

Method: 提出C-reweight方法，通过基于聚类的策略等效处理同一簇内的标记，避免重标记不匹配并保持图像保真度。

Result: 在主流图像生成平台上的评估显示，C-reweight不仅保持了图像质量，还提高了检测能力，优于现有无失真水印技术。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可靠的图像合成设定了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

Result: 模块可应用于多模态模型，在空间关系处理上表现优异；模型July仅用3B参数即达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了模型对图像内容的理解和空间关系推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中常生成输入图像中不存在的对象信息（幻觉），影响模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应和目标信息的数据集，采用偏好学习方法专注于特定目标区域，过滤无关信号以纠正幻觉。

Conclusion: 该方法通过针对性学习显著减少了幻觉问题，为MLLMs的实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在预测骨骼位置或连接性时存在不足，导致拓扑准确性低和皮肤变形问题。Auto-Connect旨在通过直接整合连接性信息和智能骨骼选择解决这些问题。

Result: 模型能生成更解剖合理的骨骼结构，显著减少皮肤变形问题，提升变形质量。

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过综合方法在自动绑定骨骼任务中表现出色，为动画和建模领域提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Conclusion: FSCA展示了在实际应用中的强大审计潜力，特别是在数据隐私和版权合规方面。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Result: 该方法在单源、多源、语义数据集和零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过创新的文本桥接设计，有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，提升了音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNNs在自动驾驶任务中易受攻击，且现有防御机制（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且无法泛化到未见攻击。

Method: 提出V2LMs，并评估两种部署策略：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务）。

Result: 实验显示，DNNs在攻击下性能下降33%-46%，而V2LMs平均仅下降不到8%。Tandem Mode在保持鲁棒性的同时更节省内存。

Conclusion: V2LMs为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更安全、更具韧性的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Conclusion: FAME具有在实际法医和信息安全应用中部署的潜力。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

*Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Hongje Seong,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的环境变化检测（ECD）任务，解决了传统场景变化检测（SCD）中视角对齐不切实际的问题，并通过多参考候选和语义聚合方法提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景变化检测（SCD）假设参考图像与查询图像视角完全对齐，这在实际中不现实。论文旨在解决这一问题，提出更实用的环境变化检测（ECD）任务。

Method: 提出了一种联合理解空间环境和检测变化的框架，利用多参考候选和语义丰富的表示来克服视角偏差和有限视野覆盖的问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上评估，显著优于现有方法的简单组合，性能接近理想设置。

Conclusion: ECD任务更贴近实际需求，提出的方法在性能上表现出色，代码将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用多模态预训练模型（如CLIP）进行无监督域适应（UDA）的新方法，通过几何嵌入关系增强伪标签和目标提示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP零样本预测和自训练机制，但目标域视觉嵌入分布可能与预训练模型偏离，导致误导信号。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和目标提示表示质量的改进。

Conclusion: 通过几何嵌入和最优传输理论，本文方法显著提升了UDA的性能和伪标签质量。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Manager的轻量级插件，用于优化双塔视觉-语言模型（VLM）和多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的性能，通过自适应聚合不同层次单模态专家的知识，显著提升了多种下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BridgeTower模型在利用单模态表示、灵活挖掘不同层次语义知识以及处理高分辨率数据方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的跨模态对齐和融合方法。

Method: 提出ManagerTower，在双塔VLM的每层跨模态层中引入Manager插件，自适应聚合单模态专家的知识；并扩展到MLLM架构（如LLaVA-OV），验证其有效性。

Result: ManagerTower在4种下游VL任务中表现优异；LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升了零样本性能，多网格算法的协同作用进一步提高了性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件通过深度和宽度两个正交视角提升视觉表示，与多网格算法协同作用，有效缓解语义模糊问题，为跨模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的GNSS-惯性初始化策略，通过延迟使用全局GNSS测量数据，利用GNSS相对距离残差和Hessian矩阵奇异值变化来确定切换时机，提高了初始化的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台的初始状态估计常因初始测量信息有限而导致估计不准确，容易陷入局部最小值。

Method: 延迟使用全局GNSS测量，先依赖GNSS相对距离残差，通过Hessian矩阵奇异值变化确定切换时机。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接使用全局GNSS数据的策略更准确和鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的策略能有效改善GNSS-惯性初始化的性能，避免局部最小值问题。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Conclusion: FIMA-Q通过改进量化损失的计算和FIM的近似方法，有效提升了ViTs在低比特量化下的精度，为后训练量化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such

SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to
detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This
approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为旋转估计提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，特别适用于大规模和异常值较多的情况。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）中，时空动态性和模型限制带来了独特挑战，现有方法难以直接集成增强模块。

Method: 提出EyeSimVQA框架，采用双分支结构（美学分支和技术分支），集成自修复模块和生物启发预测头。

Result: 在五个公共VQA基准测试中表现优于或与现有方法相当，同时提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA通过自由能量自修复和生物启发设计，有效解决了VQA中的挑战，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中，DaMO显著优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确时间对齐的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明长链思维（CoT）能提升MLLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，需要量化分析视觉线索提取与推理对性能的贡献。

Method: 提出基于GPT-Image-1的自动编辑管道，精确修改视觉线索；构建VFaith-Bench基准，通过编辑图像生成对比问题对，测试模型视觉推理能力。

Result: VFaith-Bench包含755个条目和五类子集，测试主流模型后发现其视觉推理能力与感知密切相关。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了MLLMs推理能力与视觉感知的关系，为未来模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 未来可通过增加数据集或图像增强方法进一步改进性能。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012上显著优于现有方法，仅用20%预算即超越其他方法，性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A$^2$LC是一种高效且有效的标签校正框架，适用于语义分割任务。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Result: 在两个大型公开数据集上展示了优越性能。

Conclusion: 多模态协作感知方法显著提升了行为识别的准确性。

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语生成需要复杂的姿态、表情和身体动作，现有方法难以实现逼真和自然的生成。

Method: SignAligner方法包括三个阶段：1) 联合生成姿态坐标、手势和身体动作；2) 使用动态损失权重和跨模态注意力校正模态；3) 通过预训练网络合成视频。

Result: 实验表明，SignAligner显著提高了生成手语视频的准确性和表现力。

Conclusion: SignAligner通过多模态协作和校正，实现了更逼真和自然的手语生成。

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肤色在计算机视觉中以张量数据表示，与传统的分类特征（如性别和种族）不同，现有研究未能充分处理其复杂性。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器学习中肤色公平性提供了更灵活和精确的解决方案，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM），通过因果框架分析预测任务中的信息路径，并引入DISCO正则化策略以优化条件独立性，有效减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在预测任务中，模型可能利用无关信号（如光照条件）作为捷径，导致预测结果不理想。本文旨在解决这一问题，确保模型仅关注与标签直接相关的因果路径。

Method: 提出SAM模型，建立反因果设置的因果框架；引入DISCO正则化策略，利用条件距离相关性优化回归任务中的条件独立性。

Result: DISCO在不同偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代方案。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为预测任务提供了一种新的因果分析方法，能够有效避免无关信号的干扰，提升模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线图像中违禁物品的外观与自然物体差异大，且物体间严重重叠，导致实例分割任务困难。

Method: 集成SAM模型以利用其先验知识，设计遮挡感知的双层掩码解码器模块，并标注了两个大规模数据集（PIDray-A和PIXray-A）用于监督。

Result: 在遮挡标注的数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决X射线图像中违禁物品的实例分割问题，尤其是遮挡问题。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态架构演化的方法D-MoLE，用于多模态大语言模型的持续指令调优，解决了任务架构冲突和模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用固定架构，难以适应新任务，需动态调整模型架构以持续适应任务。

Method: 提出D-MoLE方法，包括动态层间专家分配器和梯度驱动的跨模态课程，以优化架构和模态更新。

Result: 实验显示D-MoLE显著优于基线方法，平均提升15%。

Conclusion: 首次从架构角度研究多模态大语言模型的持续学习，D-MoLE有效解决了任务适应问题。

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在医学图像识别中存在负样本选择不当、忽略局部细节和低层次特征的问题，影响了诊断准确性。

Method: 结合跨模态注意力扩展k-means聚类用于负采样，并引入跨模态掩码图像重建模块（CM-MIR）增强局部特征提取。

Result: 在五个下游数据集的分类、检测和分割任务中，CM-CGNS在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS能有效学习医学视觉表征，适用于多种识别任务，性能优越。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Result: Task 1分割得分为0.8601，Task 2分类得分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 该方法在气道影像生物标志物分析中表现出有效性，对预测肺纤维化患者生存具有潜力。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Result: ViT的测试准确率最高（90%），且与其他模型差异显著（ANOVA，p < 0.001）。ViT能定位动作相关区域，而其他模型易受背景干扰。

Conclusion: Transformer在数据效率上表现优异，可解释性技术有助于诊断模型失败原因。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA填补了多表格视觉推理的评估空白，微调方法为提升模型性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上的实验表明，DMAF-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net通过动态融合和蒸馏策略，显著提升了不完全多模态医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative

conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

*Byeongchan Lee,John Won,Seunghyun Lee,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION提出了一种结合判别式和生成式基础模型的方法，用于解决异常检测中的复杂问题，并在基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测因异常定义的模糊性、异常类型的多样性以及训练数据的稀缺性而复杂，需要一种能同时捕捉低层次和高层次特征的综合性模型。

Method: CLIPFUSION结合了基于CLIP的判别式模型（捕捉全局特征）和基于扩散的生成式模型（捕捉局部细节），并利用扩散模型的交叉注意力图和特征图进行异常检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA等基准数据集上，CLIPFUSION在异常分割和分类任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了多模态和多模型融合在解决异常检测多面挑战中的有效性，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgentSense利用大型语言模型生成虚拟数据，通过模拟家庭环境和传感器记录活动，解决了智能家居中人类活动识别（HAR）数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居HAR系统缺乏大规模多样化标注数据，且家庭布局、传感器配置和用户行为的多样性增加了系统开发的复杂性。

Method: 通过AgentSense生成虚拟人物及其日常活动序列，在扩展的VirtualHome模拟环境中记录虚拟传感器数据。

Result: 在五个HAR基准数据集上，虚拟数据显著提升了模型性能，尤其是真实数据有限时。少量真实数据结合虚拟数据即可达到与完整真实数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 虚拟数据为解决HAR领域缺乏大规模标注数据的问题提供了有效途径，无需人工数据收集。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

Conclusion: 实时反馈系统为家庭健身提供了专家级诊断，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在心脏超声领域面临挑战，如样本相似性高、低PSNR输入敏感性及增强失真临床特征。

Method: DISCOVR结合聚类视频编码器和在线图像编码器，通过语义聚类蒸馏损失传递解剖知识。

Result: 在六个超声心动图数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本和线性探测设置中优于现有方法，并实现更好的分割迁移。

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支框架和知识蒸馏，显著提升了心脏超声视频的自监督学习性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ是一种高效且有效的ViT量化框架，通过分阶段量化激活和权重，显著提升了4位量化模型的性能，同时降低了计算成本和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ和QAT方法在ViT量化中存在显著局限性，如精度下降、计算成本高、泛化能力差等。

Method: GPLQ采用两阶段策略：第一阶段量化激活并保持权重为FP32，第二阶段量化权重。

Result: GPLQ比现有QAT方法快100倍，内存占用低于FP32训练，4位量化模型性能接近FP32模型。

Conclusion: GPLQ为ViT量化提供了一种通用、实用且高效的解决方案，并计划开源支持多任务的工具包。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Result: 发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，提出平衡多语言微调策略，有效提升模型适应性。

Conclusion: 通过系统性研究，建立了新的VLT评估基准，并提出了改进模型性能的策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Result: SphereDrag在几何一致性和图像质量上显著优于现有方法，相对提升达10.5%。

Conclusion: SphereDrag通过结合球形几何知识，为全景图像编辑提供了准确可控的解决方案，并在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Conclusion: O2Former通过针对性设计显著提升了SAR图像中船舶实例分割的精度和效率。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，目前机制尚不明确。

Method: 使用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调整。

Result: 实验表明，视觉表征逐渐与语言表征对齐，但早期层存在不匹配，引发对当前适配器架构的质疑。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉与语言表征对齐的层级过程，并指出当前适配器架构可能并非最优。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型多模态推理模型VGR，通过增强细粒度视觉感知能力，解决了传统方法在视觉推理任务中的语言偏差和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖纯语言空间进行推理，存在语言偏差且局限于数学或科学领域，无法处理需要全面理解图像细节的复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并基于这些区域提供精确答案，结合视觉定位和语言推理的大规模SFT数据集VGR-SFT进行训练。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基准上，VGR在多模态任务中表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数量，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升了4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉定位和语言推理，显著提升了多模态任务的性能，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

Result: 模型在2D和3D基准测试中表现优异，尤其在开放词汇跨域泛化中有效。

Conclusion: Affogato数据集和模型为交互区域定位提供了新基准和解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

Result: 系统总结了KGR的研究趋势和未来方向。

Conclusion: 本文为KGR领域的研究提供了全面的综述，并指出了未来发展方向。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

TL;DR: OntoGSN是一个基于GSN标准的本体和中间件，用于管理保证案例（ACs），提供知识表示、可查询图和自动化工具，以解决AC维护的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管理保证案例（ACs）在动态环境中面临挑战，现有工具难以有效维护和更新嵌入的知识，导致开发者难以管理或产生虚假信心。

Method: 提出OntoGSN，包括GSN标准的OWL本体、辅助本体和解析器、设计决策库、SPARQL查询库和原型界面。

Result: OntoGSN严格遵循GSN标准，并通过FAIR原则、OOPS框架、能力问题和社区反馈评估。

Conclusion: OntoGSN为动态AC管理提供了实用工具，并通过大型语言模型的对抗鲁棒性案例展示了其效用。

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合模糊逻辑和大语言模型（LLM）的方法（LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge），用于自动化评估医学生的临床沟通技能，以解决规模化评估与医生主观判断对齐的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床沟通技能在医学教育中至关重要，但规模化练习和评估这些技能具有挑战性。现有LLM驱动的临床模拟虽有效，但自动化评估难以匹配医生的主观判断。

Method: 通过收集LLM驱动的医学教育系统数据，基于多维模糊集（如专业性、医学相关性、伦理行为和上下文干扰）进行标注，结合提示工程和监督微调（SFT）预训练LLM。

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge在评估中达到80%以上的准确率，主要标准项超过90%，实现了可解释且与人类判断对齐的评估。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合模糊逻辑和LLM可以有效地对齐人类偏好，推动医学教育中的自动化评估，并为更稳健的评估实践提供支持。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无监督域适应算法在多标签任务和资源受限设备中的局限性，特别是在城市声音分类场景中。

Method: MUDAS通过选择性重训练分类器、使用高置信度数据、自适应阈值生成伪标签，并应用多样性正则化。

Result: 在SONYC-UST数据集上，MUDAS显著优于现有UDA算法，适用于资源受限的物联网设备。

Conclusion: MUDAS为多标签声音分类提供了一种高效的无监督域适应解决方案，适用于低功耗设备。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

Method: ChemTable从文献实验部分收集真实化学表格，包含专家标注的单元格多边形、逻辑布局和领域特定标签，支持表格识别和理解两大任务。

Result: 模型在基础布局解析上表现尚可，但在描述性和推理性问答任务上显著落后于人类表现，开源与闭源模型间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: ChemTable为化学表格理解提供了严格且现实的基准，凸显了化学领域表格理解的挑战。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: FocalAD是一种新型端到端自动驾驶框架，专注于关键局部邻居并通过增强局部运动表示优化规划，显著提升了规划可靠性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局运动特征，忽视了规划决策主要受少量局部交互代理影响，导致潜在风险被忽视和规划可靠性下降。

Method: FocalAD包含两个核心模块：Ego-Local-Agents Interactor（ELAI）和Focal-Local-Agents Loss（FLA Loss），分别通过基于图的自我中心交互表示和增加关键邻居权重来优化规划。

Result: FocalAD在nuScenes和Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优于现有方法，在Adv-nuScenes数据集上碰撞率分别降低了41.9%和15.6%。

Conclusion: FocalAD通过聚焦局部交互显著提升了自动驾驶规划的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

Result: 在模拟高速公路合并场景中，该方法显著提高了合并效率，尤其是在高密度交通环境下。

Conclusion: 局部状态注意力模块能有效提升多智能体强化学习在复杂交通环境中的性能。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、ImageNet等数据集上，SACP在压缩效率和精度保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SACP通过全局结构建模和自动化剪枝，显著提升了剪枝效果，适用于资源受限设备的高效部署。

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

Motivation: 探索无需大规模强化学习训练的神经符号协调方法，提升自动定理证明的性能和可解释性。

Method: 改进DSP框架，分阶段（草稿、草图、证明）精细整合神经符号方法，包括自然语言子目标生成、自动形式化和符号搜索。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

TL;DR: RAG+通过将应用感知推理显式纳入RAG流程，显著提升了知识密集型任务中LLM的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG范式忽略了知识应用的认知步骤，导致检索到的事实与任务特定推理之间存在鸿沟。

Method: RAG+构建了包含知识和应用示例的双重语料库，并在推理过程中联合检索两者，以支持目标导向的推理。

Result: 在数学、法律和医学领域的实验中，RAG+平均提升3-5%，复杂场景下峰值提升达7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+通过将检索与可操作应用结合，为知识集成提供了更认知基础的框架，推动了LLM的可解释性和能力提升。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

*Byeongchan Lee,Jonghoon Lee,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种测试时协作框架，让小模型和大模型通过多轮协作解决复杂任务，以降低成本并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型性能强但成本高，小模型免费但能力不足，如何结合两者的优势是一个自然的问题。

Method: 通过一个规划器模型生成问题的高层抽象计划，再由推理器模型生成完整解决方案，小模型和大模型轮流担任规划器和推理器。

Result: 该方法在保持高性能的同时显著减少了对付费推理的依赖。

Conclusion: 规划是协调成本感知、跨模型推理的有效先验方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的德语基准数据集，用于评估视觉语言模型在结合视觉推理和学科背景知识任务中的表现，发现现有模型在真实世界多模态理解中存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有英语基准数据集多为脱离上下文或人为设计的难题，缺乏真实性和多学科背景，因此需要一种基于真实中学课程内容的数据集来更全面地评估模型。

Method: 数据集包含2,000多个开放式问题，基于486张图像，覆盖数学、历史、生物等九大学科，评估了13种先进开源视觉语言模型的多维度表现。

Result: 最强模型总体准确率不足45%，在音乐、数学和对抗性问题中表现尤其差，揭示了模型在真实多模态任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 中学水平任务是测试视觉语言模型的有效途径，尤其在非英语语境中，该数据集为未来AI系统的视觉和语言推理能力提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

Motivation: 现有方法在减少多模态大语言模型幻觉时存在优化目标函数不严谨和偏好监督间接的问题，SymMPO旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出SymMPO，通过对称偏好学习和直接偏好监督增强视觉理解，同时保持与标准DPO的理论一致性，并引入偏好边际一致性损失来量化调节偏好差距。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，SymMPO表现出色，验证了其在减少幻觉方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SymMPO通过对称偏好学习和直接监督，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能，减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

Motivation: 研究R-GNNs在规划领域中学习价值函数的能力，尤其是其与$C_2$特征的关联。

Method: 通过理论分析，探讨R-GNNs与$C_2$特征之间的关系，并对比其他GNN架构。

Result: 发现R-GNNs无法学习由$C_2$特征定义的价值函数，但其他GNN架构可能更适合。

Conclusion: R-GNNs在规划领域中的局限性被揭示，未来研究可探索其他GNN架构以更好地学习$C_2$特征定义的价值函数。

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果推断中，潜在混杂因素的存在使得因果效应的估计变得复杂。本文旨在利用多环境数据，通过某些不变性条件，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了基于矩的算法，用于估计因果效应，并假设数据生成机制中只有一个参数在不同环境中变化。此外，还提出了识别变化参数的方法。

Result: 证明了因果效应在特定条件下是可识别的，但如果潜在混杂因素和处理变量的外生噪声分布同时变化，则无法识别。实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过多环境数据和不变性假设，可以有效地估计因果效应，但需注意参数变化的限制。

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Method: 系统评估了多种LLMs在国际住房数据集上的表现，比较了零样本、少样本、市场报告增强和混合提示技术。

Result: LLMs能有效利用特征变量生成有意义的估计，尽管传统机器学习在预测准确性上更强，但LLMs提供了更易用和可解释的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLMs在提升房地产评估透明度方面具有潜力，但需谨慎处理其过度自信和空间推理限制，同时提供了实用的提示优化建议。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

Motivation: 探索LLM在政治辩论中的偏见和互动动态，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过多智能体辩论框架，系统调整LLM类型、代理性别和辩论形式，分析政治偏见和态度变化。

Result: 中立代理倾向民主党，共和党代理向中立靠拢；性别影响态度；相同政治倾向的代理会形成回音室。

Conclusion: LLM的政治偏见和性别属性显著影响辩论动态，需在设计时注意这些因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险场景中的应用增加，其存在的伦理问题（如人口统计偏见、问责制和隐私）引起了关注。本文旨在研究这些偏见如何被模型学习，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过基于AI的自动化招聘案例研究，提出了一种隐私增强框架，以减少学习管道中的性别信息。实验分析了两种不同LLMs的数据偏见影响，并验证了框架的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，提出的框架能有效防止训练后的系统再现数据中的偏见。

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架是缓解LLMs中人口统计偏见的有效方法，尤其在自动化招聘等高影响场景中。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

Motivation: 解决人机协作决策中预测正确性、知识成本和置信度平衡的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：延迟策略决定是否接受基础模型的答案或使用更大模型重新生成；放弃策略决定是否需要人工干预。结合在线学习机制。

Result: 在通用问答（ARC-Easy、ARC-Challenge）和医学问答（MedQA、MedMCQA）中，级联策略在准确性和成本上优于单模型基线。

Conclusion: 级联LLM框架在平衡准确性、成本和置信度方面表现优越，适合复杂决策任务。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模式链接模型的微调方法过度依赖死记硬背，缺乏推理能力，原因是高质量推理样本难以获取。

Method: Schema-R1通过三步实现：构建高质量推理样本小批量、监督微调冷启动初始化、基于规则的强化学习训练。

Result: 模型显著提升了推理能力，过滤准确率提高了10%。

Conclusion: Schema-R1通过强化学习有效解决了模式链接模型的推理能力不足问题。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多关注最终结果，而忽视了中间推理步骤，这些步骤对理解模型行为和提升可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出一个框架，利用战略游戏作为评估环境，定义多个新指标（如修正成功率、过度修正风险率等），并在12个领先模型上进行4320轮对抗测试。

Result: ChatGPT-o3-mini表现最佳，胜率74.7%，修正成功率78.6%；而Qwen-Plus因资源过度使用表现较差。过度修正风险率与修正成功率呈负相关。

Conclusion: 评估LLMs的决策过程（而不仅是结果）对理解其行为和改进可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

Motivation: 电信运营调度任务复杂且缺乏评估基准，阻碍了大语言模型在该领域的应用潜力研究。

Method: 设计了TeleEval-OS基准，涵盖四个运营阶段和四个能力层级，采用零样本和少样本评估方法测试14个大语言模型。

Result: 开源大语言模型在特定场景下表现优于闭源模型，展示了其在电信运营调度中的潜力。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS填补了研究空白，为大语言模型在电信运营调度中的应用提供了系统评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

Result: 多模态交互加剧了位置偏差，且偏差随检索范围对数增长。

Conclusion: 研究为RAG中的位置感知分析提供了理论和实证基础，建议采用证据重排序或去偏策略以提高系统可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk

Result: ChatGPT表现最佳（实体范围错误率28.2%，状态/系统错误率14.5%），开源LLM也表现良好（实体范围错误率30.5-36.7%，状态/系统错误率24.3-27.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流程可扩展且本地可部署，开源LLM在资源有限的医疗环境中是商业模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [118] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在道德推理中的一种偏见，即“义务关键词偏见”（DKB），表现为模型倾向于将非义务场景判断为义务。通过引入少量示例和推理提示，作者提出了一种缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在道德判断中的表现，特别是其对义务的判断，发现现有研究未充分探讨模态表达（如“必须”或“应该”）对LLMs判断的影响。

Method: 通过实验揭示LLMs在模态表达存在时对义务判断的偏见（DKB），并提出结合少量示例和推理提示的策略来缓解这种偏见。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在模态表达存在时会将90%以上的常识场景判断为义务，且这种偏见在不同模型、问题类型和答案格式中一致存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模态表达对LLMs规范性决策的影响，并提出了缓解DKB的方法，为LLMs的道德对齐提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种接口架构，用于弥合设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距，通过自然语言指令实现对原型模型的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设计师希望通过自然语言指令直观地控制原型模型，但现有大型语言模型在此领域的潜力未充分发挥，主要因语言抽象层次、语义精度和词汇范围的不匹配。

Method: 基于快速原型设计实践的系统研究，设计了一种接口架构及其操作机制，并开发了自动化领域规范算法。

Result: 机器评估和跨产品设计领域的人体研究表明，该接口可作为大型语言模型的辅助模块，实现对原型模型的精确有效控制。

Conclusion: 该接口架构能够有效弥合设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距，提升原型模型控制的自然性和精确性。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM提出了一种近乎无需训练的方法，通过调整跨语言注意力模式来减少多语言对象幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多语言查询中更容易产生与视觉输入不一致的响应，现有方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调。

Method: CLAIM通过识别语言特定的跨模态注意力头，估计从英语到目标语言的注意力偏移向量，并在推理过程中干预注意力输出。

Result: 实验显示CLAIM在POPE和MME基准测试中分别平均提升了13.56%和21.75%的性能。

Conclusion: CLAIM有效减少了多语言对象幻觉，且中间层的注意力差异在多语言场景中尤为关键。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调节反思令牌（reflection tokens）使用的方法CyclicReflex，通过周期性调度提升大型推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反思令牌在大型推理模型中的使用存在过度或不足的问题，影响模型性能，因此需要一种动态调节机制。

Method: 提出CyclicReflex方法，通过位置相关的三角波形动态调整反思令牌的logits。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型规模上，CyclicReflex表现优于标准解码和其他方法。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex有效解决了反思令牌资源分配问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

TL;DR: RoE-FND是一个基于逻辑推理的假新闻检测框架，结合大语言模型与经验学习，通过自反知识构建和动态准则检索提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线虚假内容泛滥，现有假新闻检测方法存在证据选择噪声、泛化瓶颈和决策不透明等问题，且大语言模型可能产生幻觉或偏见。

Method: RoE-FND分两阶段：自反知识构建（分析历史推理错误）和动态准则检索（从历史案例中提取推理准则），并通过双通道程序交叉验证。

Result: 框架在三个数据集上验证了其优于现有方法的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RoE-FND通过经验学习和逻辑推理解决了假新闻检测的多重挑战，无需训练即可适应动态环境。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

TL;DR: MANBench是一个双语基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多种任务中的表现，发现其在某些领域仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MLLMs是否能在多模态任务中超越人类表现，并提供一个严格的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含1,314个问题的双语基准测试（MANBench），涵盖九类任务，并通过人类实验与MLLMs进行对比。

Result: MLLMs在知识类和文本-图像理解任务中表现优异，但在跨模态推理任务中表现不佳，且与人类在复杂任务中均面临挑战。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs的局限性，并呼吁进一步研究以缩小其与人类多模态能力的差距。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用开源大语言模型（LLM）从自然语言规范中生成带计数器的上下文无关文法（CCFG）的方法，结合强化学习优化文法有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范生成有效且通用的文法是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。CCFG能通过计数器表示逻辑约束，但如何高效生成仍待解决。

Method: 方法包括：1）微调开源LLM进行规范到文法的翻译；2）使用GRPO强化学习优化文法；3）通过迭代反馈修正语法和语义错误。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE方法在文法质量和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLM，文法有效性提升15.92%，测试效果提升12.34%。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和强化学习的方法能高效生成高质量文法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于孤立的诊断分类，无法捕捉临床轨迹的序列依赖性，PRISM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PRISM将临床轨迹标记化为事件序列（如诊断测试、实验室结果），利用自定义临床词汇和自回归训练目标学习预测下一步骤。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在预测任务中显著优于随机基线，生成的序列反映了真实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于序列的医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成语言模型在结构化医疗数据中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险问题。

Method: 利用多LLM协作辩论，通过红队测试系统性发现不安全盲点，并结合长期记忆模块迭代改进。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，辩论减少17.7%不安全行为，结合记忆模块后减少超过23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个结合多智能体辩论和红队测试的全自动AI安全增强框架。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但实际部署中仍受事实性和忠实性幻觉的困扰。现有方法独立处理这些问题，导致性能权衡。

Method: 通过激活空间动态分析，发现幻觉类别在神经表征中共享子空间。SPACE框架利用双任务特征建模和混合探测策略（谱聚类和注意力头显著性评分）编辑这些子空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明SPACE方法的优越性。

Conclusion: SPACE为联合缓解LLMs的事实性和忠实性幻觉提供了一种统一且有效的方法。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Motivation: ASR系统在通用转录任务中表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配时仍有困难，而LLM在多领域中表现更优。

Method: 利用LLM作为奖励模型，通过强化学习对ASR模型的假设进行评分并微调，提升转录质量。

Result: 在实体词错误率上比传统自训练方法提高了21%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM反馈，显著提升了ASR模型在领域不匹配时的命名实体识别性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

TL;DR: Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT) extends RAG for multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are static and single-turn, limiting their use in dynamic domains like healthcare and smart homes.

Method: DCT uses an attention-based context cache, LoRA-based retrieval, and context compression to adapt dynamically.

Result: DCT improves plan accuracy by 14%, reduces hallucinations by 37%, and matches GPT-4 at lower cost.

Conclusion: DCT enables scalable and adaptable AI assistants in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与度至关重要，但在NLP领域研究较少。论文旨在通过建模信息缺口来填补这一空白。

Method: 利用BERTopic主题建模和持久同调技术，分析动态语义网络的拓扑结构（如连通分量、循环、空洞），将其作为信息缺口的代理特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法的拓扑特征显著提升了好奇心预测效果（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与度的关系提供了新的计算方法。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了C-SEO Bench，首个用于评估多任务、多领域和多参与者的对话搜索引擎优化（C-SEO）方法的基准。实验表明当前C-SEO方法效果有限，传统SEO策略更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对话搜索引擎优化（C-SEO）方法的广泛适用性和多参与者竞争场景下的效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖问答和产品推荐两种任务及三个领域，并引入多参与者采用率的评估协议。

Result: 当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；随着采用者增加，整体收益下降，问题呈现零和性质。

Conclusion: 对话搜索引擎优化需要更全面的评估方法，传统SEO策略在LLM背景下仍具优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: 研究为AI代理评估提供了实用指导，有助于推动这一快速发展的研究领域。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ManyICL的新方法，通过将上下文学习扩展到多样本设置，显著缩小了与专用微调的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的中等规模LLMs通过少量样本上下文微调可以实现多任务处理，但仍落后于专用微调。ManyICL旨在通过多样本上下文微调提升性能。

Method: 提出ManyICL方法，将上下文中的每个答案作为监督训练目标，而非仅预测最终答案，从而更高效地利用多样本。

Result: 实验表明，ManyICL在分类、摘要、问答等任务上显著优于零/少量样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并减轻了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: ManyICL通过多样本上下文微调显著提升了性能，解决了现有方法的不足，代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

*Hanzhi Zhang,Heng Fan,Kewei Sha,Yan Huang,Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制（DAM），通过自适应掩码解决长序列任务中静态稀疏注意力的局限性，提升计算效率且无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏注意力方法使用静态预定义掩码，无法捕捉异构注意力模式，导致长序列任务中交互效果不佳。

Method: 引入动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图级别分配自适应掩码，保留各层和头的异构模式。

Result: 该方法与全注意力模型对齐度高，计算和内存开销低，性能损失小。

Conclusion: DAM为大规模语言模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种针对医疗领域的LLM压缩框架，通过神经元剪枝和量化技术，显著减小模型体积并保持性能，成功在边缘设备上实现实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在医疗场景中潜力巨大，但体积过大难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: 通过测量领域特定数据的神经元显著性进行剪枝，再结合量化技术压缩模型。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和PubMedQA等基准测试中保持性能，Gemma和LLaMA3模型分别压缩50%和67%，成功部署在Jetson Orin Nano和Raspberry Pi 5上。

Conclusion: 该压缩框架有效解决了LLMs在边缘设备上的部署难题，实现了高效节能的实时推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG框架通过全局感知的分层查询解析和依赖感知的重新排序机制，解决了传统基于图的RAG方法在实体提取中的局限性，显著提升了检索和生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法仅依赖实体提取，可能导致关键信息和关系的遗漏或误解，影响检索和生成内容的准确性和相关性。

Method: PankRAG采用分层查询解析策略和依赖感知的重新排序机制，构建多级解析路径并利用依赖结构优化检索结果。

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过改进查询解析和检索机制，有效提升了RAG方法的性能，减少了幻觉风险并提高了生成内容的保真度。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Motivation: 解决多轮对话和链式推理中的注意力权重管理问题，提升模型的推理和对话能力。

Method: 在vLLM运行时中异步捕获每层每头的跨注意力权重，并改进自监督奖励函数以累积对话历史和推理步骤的注意力信号。

Result: 提出了一种基于熵的钳制机制，防止注意力在早期上下文中崩溃，并展示了在多轮对话和链式推理中的有效性。

Conclusion: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC为多轮对话和链式推理提供了有效解决方案，并提出了未来多参与方对话和分层推理的研究方向。

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

TL;DR: QT-Mob是一个新颖的框架，通过语义丰富的令牌表示位置和多重微调目标，显著提升了LLM在移动性分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在位置语义表示和移动信号建模方面存在不足，QT-Mob旨在解决这些问题。

Method: QT-Mob引入位置令牌化模块和多重微调目标，增强LLM对移动数据的理解。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob不仅提升了LLM的移动数据分析能力，还提供了一种更通用的方法。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench评估LLMs在面对用户对同一事实的不同表述时是否保持一致，而非因表述方式改变立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在用户对事实表述方向不同时（正确或错误）的立场一致性，而非仅依赖用户表述改变判断。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集中选取事实，构建两种表述（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型的同意与推理。通过中性表述下的准确性分层，排除模型知识差异。

Result: 旨在衡量LLMs在面对矛盾用户表述时是否坚持其事实判断。

Conclusion: AssertBench为评估LLMs在用户表述影响下的立场一致性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为评估和推进多语言、多模态医疗AI提供了全面资源，凸显了医疗AI的持续挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理的标记化策略至关重要。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集集中在狭窄领域，限制了模型的泛化能力，与专有模型差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段从1亿样本中筛选出740万高质量基础指令；第二阶段通过选择、进化和诊断过滤合成150万高质量聊天指令。

Result: 微调多个开源模型后，在基础和指令跟随任务上表现优异，InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令任务上超越GPT-4-0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct展示了基础和聊天训练的协同效应，为LLM开发提供了新思路，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both

*Junyong Lin,Lu Dai,Ruiqian Han,Yijie Sui,Ruilin Wang,Xingliang Sun,Qinglin Wu,Min Feng,Hao Liu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScIRGen是一个科学问答与检索数据集生成框架，旨在更准确地反映专业研究者的信息需求，并生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索和问答数据集通常处理简单问题，无法满足真实研究需求，因此需要开发更贴合实际信息需求的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集信息提取方法、认知分类法生成问题框架，以及基于LLM困惑度自动筛选答案的方法。

Result: 生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并发现现有方法在处理复杂问题时仍存在推理困难。

Conclusion: ScIRGen推动了支持科学社区复杂信息需求的工具发展。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

*Jingyu Li,Lingchao Mao,Hairong Wang,Zhendong Wang,Xi Mao,Xuelei Sherry Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过预训练的基础模型分析自发语音，用于阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆（ADRD）的早期检测，发现基于声学特征的方法（如ASR嵌入）表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADRD的早期检测对及时干预至关重要，自发语音中的声学和语言标记可作为非侵入性生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，包含1600多名参与者的录音，筛选后分为健康对照组（HC）、轻度认知障碍（MCI）和阿尔茨海默病（AD），并测试多种开源基础模型的分类性能。

Result: Whisper-medium模型在语音模型中表现最佳（准确率0.731，AUC 0.802），BERT在语言模型中表现最好（准确率0.662，AUC 0.744）。ASR生成的声学嵌入效果优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个基于基础模型的基准框架，表明声学方法（如ASR嵌入）在ADRD早期检测中具有可扩展、非侵入和成本效益的优势。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自蒸馏损失的梯度剪枝方法，专注于MLP模块的剪枝，显著压缩LLM且性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能强大，但部署成本高昂。现有梯度剪枝方法忽略生成能力的关键信息。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，利用原模型预测信息；专注于MLP模块剪枝。

Result: 在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，性能接近1B规模开源LLMs。

Conclusion: 该方法高效压缩LLM，性能损失小，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

TL;DR: SUTA-LM结合了基于熵最小化的TTA方法和语言模型重评分，解决了TTA与语言模型干扰的问题，在18个ASR数据集上表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端ASR在真实领域不匹配时的性能下降问题，同时避免TTA与语言模型重评分的干扰。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，通过自动步长选择机制控制适应过程，结合声学和语言信息，随后进行语言模型重评分。

Result: 在18个多样化ASR数据集上表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM是一种简单有效的方法，能够有效结合TTA和语言模型重评分，提升ASR性能。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出ASRJam和EchoGuard框架，通过对抗性扰动和自然失真干扰ASR，防止语音钓鱼攻击，同时保持人类通话体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术规模化实施，威胁安全。ASR转录环节是攻击链中最脆弱的部分。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架注入对抗性扰动，破坏攻击者的ASR；设计EchoGuard利用自然失真（如混响和回声）干扰ASR。

Result: 39人用户研究表明，EchoGuard在ASR干扰和人类听觉体验上表现最佳。

Conclusion: EchoGuard是一种实用且有效的防御手段，能在不干扰人类通话的情况下破坏语音钓鱼攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Conclusion: GUIRoboTron-Speech展示了语音指令在GUI代理中的巨大潜力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

TL;DR: 研究发现，随着语言模型的进步，其错误模式逐渐趋近于人类推理的常见误区，而非逻辑正确性的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否随着性能提升而趋近于人类的推理模式，尤其是错误模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具包，评估38个语言模型在383个逻辑推理任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，其错误答案中与人类推理误区一致的占比增加（ρ=0.360, p=0.0265），但逻辑正确性未提升。

Conclusion: 语言模型的错误模式趋近于人类认知的偏见和局限，挑战了模型规模扩大自然带来规范理性的观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在医疗领域中的幻觉问题，以提高其临床应用的可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出CHECK框架，整合结构化临床数据库和信息理论分类器，检测事实和推理幻觉。

Result: 在1500个临床问题测试中，将幻觉率从31%降至0.3%，并在多个医疗基准测试中表现优异（AUC 0.95-0.96）。

Conclusion: CHECK为高风险领域（如医疗）提供了可扩展且安全的LLM部署方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Motivation: 解决低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升问题，避免依赖标注数据。

Method: 利用现有ASR模型生成伪标签，训练高保真TTS系统，合成语音-文本对并反馈至ASR系统。

Result: 在台湾普通话任务中，Twister模型比Whisper错误率降低20%（普通话）和50%（中英混合）。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源或领域特定ASR性能提升提供了实用路径，优于伪标签自蒸馏方法。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Motivation: 研究涌现现象如何在高维系统中产生低维有效变量和理论，并探讨LLMs是否具备涌现智能。

Method: 回顾了多种量化涌现的方法，并分析LLMs的涌现能力。

Conclusion: 涌现是复杂系统的关键特性，LLMs的涌现能力值得深入探讨，但智能涌现的判定尚不明确。

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的药物停用信息对患者安全至关重要，但常埋没于非结构化文本中，需自动化工具提取。

Method: 收集三个EHR数据集，评估12种LLMs，探索多种提示策略，比较药物提取、状态分类及联合任务的性能。

Result: GPT-4o在零样本下表现最优（提取F1 94.0%，分类78.1%，联合任务72.7%），开源模型紧随其后。医学专用LLMs表现不如通用LLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs在EHR药物信息提取和停用分类中潜力巨大，开源模型可替代专有系统，少量样本学习能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Result: 模型在五个赛道中与优胜者的F1分数差距为6.46至13.13分，表现仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 小模型在资源受限环境下仍能有效完成任务，适合全球南方研究机构使用。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Motivation: 多语言表示提供了跨语言共享语义空间的机会，但现有去偏方法无法利用这一点。

Method: 提出IMSAE，通过迭代SVD截断在多语言中识别和减轻联合偏见子空间。

Result: 在八种语言和五个维度上验证了IMSAE的有效性，尤其在零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: IMSAE在保持模型效用的同时，优于传统去偏方法。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 时间表推理对LLMs是一个关键挑战，现有提示方法的效果尚未充分探索，且表现差异大，缺乏统一最优方法。

Method: 研究多种提示技术在不同表格类型中的表现，提出自适应框架SEAR，动态调整提示策略并整合结构化推理。

Result: SEAR在所有表格类型中表现优于基线方法，且表格结构重构（统一表示）能提升模型推理能力。

Conclusion: SEAR框架通过动态调整和结构化推理显著提升了时间表推理的性能，表格结构优化也有助于模型表现。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language

studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

*Yang Zhang,Amr Mohamed,Hadi Abdine,Guokan Shang,Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次系统研究了课程学习在预训练语言模型中的应用，实验表明其能提升训练效率和泛化能力，尤其在早期和中期训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习在机器学习中已显示潜力，但在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未充分探索，因此作者进行了系统性研究。

Method: 实验了多种课程学习设置，包括基础课程学习、基于步调的采样和交错课程，使用了六种难度指标（如压缩比、词汇多样性等）。

Result: 课程学习在早期和中期训练阶段显著提升收敛速度，作为预热策略时能带来3.5%的性能提升。压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性被证明是有效的难度信号。

Conclusion: 数据顺序在大规模预训练中至关重要，研究为高效、可扩展的模型开发提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

*Mohammad Hammoud,Devang Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Avey是一种新型神经网络架构，摆脱了注意力和循环机制的限制，通过分解序列长度和上下文宽度，有效处理任意长序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer虽然强大，但存在固定上下文窗口和注意力机制二次复杂度的限制，而RNN架构虽能线性扩展序列长度，但并行性受限。

Method: Avey由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，协作识别并上下文化最相关的标记，解耦序列长度与上下文宽度。

Result: Avey在短程NLP任务中表现与Transformer相当，在长程依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey提供了一种高效处理任意长序列的新方法，突破了现有架构的限制。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类句子处理难度的预测能力呈正相关，且这一趋势不仅适用于基于延迟的测量（如阅读时间），还可推广到神经测量（如脑成像数据）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理预测能力的关系，特别是在脑成像数据上的表现，以验证这一趋势的普适性。

Method: 使用17个预训练的Transformer模型，在三种不同语言家族上，对两个功能性磁共振成像数据集进行预测能力评估。

Result: 模型困惑度与模型拟合度之间的正相关关系仍然存在，表明这一趋势不仅限于延迟测量，还可推广到神经测量。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理的预测能力呈正相关，且这一关系在脑成像数据中同样成立。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Motivation: 传统同行评审流程存在局限性，而LLM的应用提供了重新设计评审机制的机会，但目前研究多集中于替代人类评审，缺乏对全新范式的探索。

Method: 采用LLM代理对论文进行成对比较，而非单独评分，通过大量比较结果聚合，更准确地衡量论文相对质量。

Result: 实验表明，成对比较方法在识别高影响力论文上显著优于传统评分方法，但也发现了新颖性降低和机构不平衡等偏见。

Conclusion: LLM在重新设计同行评审中具有潜力，但需解决公平性和多样性问题。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于文本的说话人分割（SD）新方法，通过句子级说话人变化检测，优于传统音频方法，尤其在短对话中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频SD系统受限于音频质量和说话人相似性，本文探索利用对话文本实现更准确的说话人分割。

Method: 开发了两种模型：单预测模型（SPM）和多预测模型（MPM），基于对话文本检测说话人变化。

Result: 实验表明，文本方法（尤其是MPM）在短对话中表现优于音频SD系统。

Conclusion: 文本SD方法展示了利用语言特征的潜力，未来可结合多模态和语义特征进一步研究。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor

adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知发展的启发，希望通过同步增加数据难度和模型规模来提高预训练效率。

Method: 提出Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling (CGLS)，通过逐步堆叠层和分阶段增加数据难度进行预训练。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优异，泛化能力和零样本性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CGLS展示了逐步堆叠层的潜力，是一种简单有效的策略，适用于知识密集和推理任务。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 早发性结直肠癌（EoCRC）发病率逐年上升，但该人群年龄低于国家指南推荐的筛查年龄，因此需要更有效的预测方法。

Method: 研究回顾性分析了来自美国多个健康系统的1,953名结直肠癌患者数据，应用10种机器学习模型和LLM，基于患者诊断前6个月的病情、实验室结果和观察数据进行预测。

Result: 微调后的LLM表现最佳，平均敏感性为73%，特异性为91%。

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age

applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM的KV缓存需求大，现有方法效率低或信息丢失，需高效解决方案。

Method: 分块软匹配策略，将序列分块并聚类合并KV缓存。

Result: 内存使用减少80%，解码速度提升3.19倍，延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea高效且性能接近原始模型，适用于长上下文LLM部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR通过引入代理指导机制，改进了传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中的效果，显著提升了模型在软件工程任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中效果不佳，因奖励稀疏导致训练困难。

Method: Agent-RLVR结合代理指导机制，利用多样化信息线索（如策略计划和动态反馈）引导代理完成任务。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified上，Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1性能从9.4%提升至22.4%，进一步优化后达27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR为复杂现实环境中的RLVR训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在检测缺失信息方面的能力，填补现有研究中对模型处理‘信息缺失’任务的空白。

Method: 通过AbsenceBench测试模型在三个领域（数值序列、诗歌、GitHub拉取请求）中识别被删除信息的能力，对比原始和编辑后的文档。

Result: 实验显示，即使先进模型在检测缺失信息任务上表现不佳（F1-score 69.6%），表明Transformer注意力机制难以处理‘信息缺失’。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在处理‘信息缺失’任务时的局限性，为理解模型能力的边界提供了案例。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

Result: 设计了一个针对机器翻译系统开发者的招募和游戏化评估平台。

Conclusion: 该平台有望填补资源缺口，并在更广泛的自然语言处理研究中应用，但也面临评估挑战。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Conclusion: Med-PRM通过细粒度验证推理步骤，显著提升了临床决策的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

### [178] [Relational Schemata in BERT Are Inducible, Not Emergent: A Study of Performance vs. Competence in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11485)
*Cole Gawin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨BERT是否通过预训练编码抽象关系模式，发现预训练BERT能实现高分类准确率，但关系模式需通过微调任务诱导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型（如BERT）在语义任务中的表现是否反映真正的概念能力，还是仅基于表面统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT内部表示，比较概念对在分类、部分和功能关系中的表现，并对比预训练和微调后的[CLS]标记嵌入结构。

Result: 预训练BERT能实现高分类准确率，但关系模式仅在微调后显现在高维嵌入空间中。

Conclusion: 行为表现不必然反映结构化概念理解，但模型可通过适当训练获得关系抽象的归纳偏差。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LRSA的方法，通过LagKV压缩技术优化长上下文处理，减少计算和内存开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在处理长上下文时因注意力计算复杂度和内存占用高而受限的问题。

Method: 采用LagKV压缩方法，分块预填充并选择最相关的键值对，以高效处理长上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLMs在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答任务中取得更好的微调效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法在减少计算和内存开销的同时，有效提升了长上下文处理的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Conclusion: 端到端方法在多模态对话响应生成中具有潜力，参数共享策略是有效的优化手段。

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Motivation: 个性化对话生成需保持连贯性且符合用户特质，现有方法难以兼顾，因此提出MUDI以解决这一问题。

Method: 利用LLM标注话语关系并构建对话图，采用DialogueGAT编码器捕捉隐含关系，解码时引入连贯性注意力策略。

Result: 实验表明MUDI显著提升了个性化对话的生成质量，更接近人类对话。

Conclusion: MUDI通过结构化对话图和连贯性注意力策略，有效提升了个性化对话的自然性和一致性。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在多语言文本加音标任务中的有效性，并与专业加音标模型对比。

Method: 评测14种不同规模、可访问性和语言覆盖的LLMs，并使用LoRA微调4种小型开源模型。

Result: 多数现成LLMs优于专业模型，但小型模型易产生幻觉；微调可提升性能并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: LLMs在加音标任务中表现优异，微调小型模型可进一步优化效果。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨场景上下文如何影响人类对抽象形状的概念化，并比较人类与多模态LLM在概念化上的差异。

Method: 使用SceneGram数据集，分析人类在不同场景中对抽象形状的命名，并评估多模态LLM的表现。

Result: 人类的概念化具有丰富性和变异性，而多模态LLM未能充分模拟这种多样性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文显著影响人类概念化，多模态LLM需进一步改进以更好地模拟人类认知。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Motivation: 现有方法在领域特定任务（尤其是小型边缘侧模型）上的效果和效率仍有局限。

Method: 利用云端大模型生成LoRA参数，通过重参数化技术将其融入边缘侧模型，实现灵活专业化。

Result: 在未专门训练的情况下，LoRA-Gen优于传统LoRA微调，推理效率提升2.1倍，压缩比达10.1倍。

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen显著提升了边缘侧模型的性能和效率，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了基于临床笔记的CRF填充系统的发展。

Method: 提出一种半自动转换方法，将E3C数据集（英语和意大利语）转化为结构化CRF。

Result: 在生成的CRF数据集上，槽填充任务在零样本LLM上表现分别为意大利语59.7%和英语67.3%，开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 填充CRF对当前最先进的LLM仍具挑战性，研究者发布了数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

TL;DR: Amnesic probing是一种通过移除特定语言信息来评估模型行为的技术。INLP方法在移除信息时会引入随机修改，而MP和LEACE方法能更精准地移除信息，提升行为解释的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除模型中的特定语言信息，以评估其对模型行为的影响。

Method: 提出并比较了INLP、MP和LEACE三种信息移除技术。

Result: MP和LEACE比INLP更精准地移除目标信息，减少了随机修改。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE方法在Amnesic probing中表现更优，有助于更准确地解释模型行为。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT)框架，通过动态调整语言模型行为以适应多样化人类偏好，取代传统静态偏好假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐模型（如DPO）假设偏好是静态且单一的，限制了模型的适应能力。CPT旨在解决这一问题，实现基于明确指令的动态行为调整。

Method: CPT利用合成生成的偏好数据，结合结构化、细粒度的评分标准（如写作风格），通过微调使模型能根据系统提示动态调整输出，无需重新训练。

Result: CPT提供了细粒度控制，并能建模更复杂、上下文相关的人类反馈。实验代码、生成数据集和微调模型已开源。

Conclusion: CPT为语言模型动态适应多样化偏好提供了有效框架，提升了AI对齐的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习（DL）中从传统64位浮点计算转向低精度格式（如FP16、BF16、8/16位整数）的趋势，并提出了适应混合精度整数（MIP）算术的通用矩阵乘法（gemm）优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着硬件架构向混合精度点积操作优化，传统的高性能gemm方法已不再适用，需要新的优化策略以适应现代指令集架构（ISA）。

Method: 论文提出了新颖的微内核设计和数据布局，以更好地利用现代专用硬件，并在x86_64、ARM和RISC-V三种CPU架构上验证了MIP算术的性能优势。

Result: 实验表明，MIP算术在性能上显著优于浮点实现，展示了混合精度计算在现代DL推理中的潜力。

Conclusion: 论文标志着矩阵乘法优化的新时代，称为“寒武纪时期”，为异构架构上的DL推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

TL;DR: DART提出了一种自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought（ST）替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought（CoT），以提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理计算开销大，限制了在延迟敏感应用中的部署。

Method: DART通过两个训练路径（CoT路径和ST路径）和一个轻量级的Reasoning Evolvement Module（REM）实现推理效率提升。

Result: 实验表明，DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: DART是高效推理的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Result: 开发了包含100个任务的基准，并开源以促进LLM代理的发展。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench填补了评估DRA能力的空白，并提供了实用工具加速相关研究。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，揭示了长短期对齐与长度泛化性能的强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的长上下文建模提供了新思路，通过输出分布对齐提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常表现出左倾偏见，而身份提示可以调整模型行为以匹配不同社会经济群体。本研究旨在验证零样本身份提示是否能准确预测个体投票行为和政策立场。

Method: 使用零样本身份提示，结合有限信息，预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为和政策立场，并评估其对反事实论点、不同提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，模型能较好地模拟欧洲议会议员的投票行为，加权F1分数约为0.793。

Conclusion: 零样本身份提示可以有效预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为和政策立场，为政治模拟提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态大语言模型在简单抽象视觉刺激（如色块和色格）的指代消解任务中的语言能力，发现其基本语用能力仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管任务对人类来说简单，但对多模态大语言模型的语用能力测试具有重要意义。

Method: 通过简单抽象的视觉刺激（如色块和色格）设计指代消解任务。

Result: 结果表明，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在基本语用能力（如颜色描述的上下文依赖解释）上仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在基本语用能力方面仍需改进。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

*Yi-Pei Chen,Noriki Nishida,Hideki Nakayama,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPA是一种新颖的两阶段框架，用于多会话个性化对话生成，通过后验对齐策略提升一致性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成个性化对话时难以同时保持长期一致性和多样性，PPA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PPA首先生成通用响应，再检索相关人物记忆并调整响应以对齐人物特征。

Result: 实验表明PPA在一致性、多样性和人物相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

TL;DR: FourierAttention通过利用Transformer头维度的异质性，将长上下文不敏感的维度投影到正交傅里叶基上，以固定长度的谱系数近似其时间演化，从而减少KV缓存的内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着上下文长度增加，大型语言模型的KV缓存内存需求急剧增长，现有压缩方法往往牺牲准确性或引入计算开销。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，将长上下文不敏感的维度投影到正交傅里叶基上，并用固定长度的谱系数近似其时间演化。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上的评估显示，FourierAttention在LongBench和Needle-In-A-Haystack任务上实现了最佳的长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: FourierAttention通过优化内存和计算效率，提供了一种无需训练的长上下文处理解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Motivation: 德语NLP需要针对其语言特性的现代模型和数据集，GeistBERT旨在填补这一需求。

Method: 基于GottBERT权重，使用WWM预训练，并扩展支持长序列的变体模型。

Result: 在NER和文本分类任务中表现优异，部分任务超越更大模型。

Conclusion: GeistBERT为德语NLP研究提供了强大工具，并开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Result: 两种分类策略在专家和用户撰写的CS上均表现优异（平均F1分别为0.94和0.96），优于基线方法，并揭示了维度间的强相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估CS有效性提供了理论基础和实践工具，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

### [199] [Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11930)
*Dongwei Jiang,Alvin Zhang,Andrew Wang,Nicholas Andrews,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在接收外部反馈时的能力，发现即使接近完美的反馈条件下，模型仍表现出对反馈的抵抗性（称为“反馈摩擦”），并尝试了多种策略缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在接收外部反馈时是否能有效改进其回答，尤其是在理想条件下。

Method: 设计了一个实验环境，包括问题求解模型和反馈生成器，评估模型在数学推理、知识推理等任务中的表现。

Result: 发现模型对反馈存在抵抗性，尝试的策略虽有所改善但未达目标性能。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLMs的显著限制，排除了一些潜在原因，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易受对抗攻击，现有防御方法难以泛化。

Method: 将模型防御问题转化为对比表示学习问题，结合三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有基于表示工程的防御方法，提升了对抗输入级和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的CRL框架有效提升了LLMs的防御能力，且不影响标准性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对代码风格的影响，分析了命名规范、复杂性、可维护性和相似性，发现LLMs显著改变了编程风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，代码生成能力正在重塑编程实践，但LLMs是否改变了代码风格尚不明确。

Method: 分析了2020至2025年间19,000多个GitHub仓库的代码，重点关注命名规范、复杂性等指标。

Result: 研究发现LLMs显著影响了代码风格，例如Python中snake_case变量名的比例从47%增至51%。

Conclusion: LLMs对现实世界的编程风格产生了可测量的影响，但具体比例难以精确估计。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

*Mae Younes,Adnane Boukhayma*

TL;DR: AA-2DGS是一种改进的2D高斯泼溅方法，解决了原始2DGS在不同采样率下的锯齿问题，提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS在训练和渲染采样率不一致时会出现严重锯齿，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 引入世界空间平滑核和对象空间Mip滤波器，约束高斯基元的频率内容并优化抗锯齿处理。

Result: AA-2DGS显著减少了锯齿，提升了多尺度渲染质量。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS在保持几何优势的同时，有效解决了2DGS的抗锯齿问题。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Method: 提出了CGVQM，一种全参考视频质量指标，利用预训练的3D CNN特征空间与人类视觉感知的强关联性。

Result: 现有全参考质量指标在高级渲染失真上表现不佳（最高Pearson相关性0.78），CGVQM显著优于现有指标。

Conclusion: CGVQM在评估高级渲染失真时表现优异，同时提供像素级误差图和全局质量分数。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Conclusion: 该工作为研究神经电路的设计原则提供了新方法，并可能为更先进的人工神经网络开发提供信息。

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间的直接联系，提升模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）对模型激活进行分层训练，并通过余弦相似度对齐SAE单元与fMRI信号，构建体素字典。

Result: SAE单元保留了功能结构，ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$在早期层利用低级信息生成高级语义信息。

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap为深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间的无下游任务桥梁提供了新见解。

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

Conclusion: 研究表明Swin Transformer能高效学习人脑时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和开发脑机接口提供了潜力。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Result: 在反应扩散系统和社会隔离的基于代理模型中，方法可靠地恢复了参数，并成功应用于真实生物模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论和实验研究复杂随机模式形成的动力学提供了潜在工具。

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse

featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge

to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合模型和系统优化的方法，显著降低实时推荐系统的延迟并提高吞吐量，同时保持推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网服务的快速增长，实时推荐系统面临高计算成本和资源瓶颈的挑战，需要在不牺牲推荐质量的情况下减少延迟并提高吞吐量。

Method: 在模型层面，采用轻量级网络设计、结构化剪枝和权重量化；在系统层面，整合异构计算平台和高性能推理库，并设计基于实时负载特性的弹性推理调度和负载均衡机制。

Result: 实验表明，方法在保持推荐准确性的同时，将延迟降低至基线的30%以下，系统吞吐量提高了一倍以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模在线推荐服务的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

*Abdul Haque,Umm e Hani,Ahmad Din,Muhammad Babar,Ali Abbas,Insaf Ullah*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GraphRAG-Causal结合图检索与大语言模型，提升新闻分析中的因果推理能力，显著优于传统NLP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法在识别复杂、隐含的因果关系时表现不佳，尤其是在数据稀缺场景中。

Method: 通过将新闻标题转化为因果知识图，结合语义嵌入和图结构线索，利用Neo4j进行高效检索，并通过大语言模型进行推理。

Result: 实验显示，仅用20个few-shot示例，GraphRAG-Causal在因果分类任务中达到82.1%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了准确性和一致性，适用于新闻可靠性评估、虚假信息检测和政策分析等实时应用。

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI工具在专业知识工作中能力增强但仍碎片化，缺乏持续协作的架构支持。

Method: 提出三层框架，强调流程的显式化、可检查和可适应性。

Result: 该框架揭示了当前工具的局限性，统一了系统设计方法，并为研究者和开发者提供了新机会。

Conclusion: 通过结构化协作，重新构想人机协作为一个连贯、对齐的系统，而非任务特定的增强。

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

Result: 研究表明，过高真实性的头像会增加新手教师的认知负荷，Graduated Realism框架能有效平衡教学需求与技术实现。

Conclusion: 基于教学理论的头像设计是开发高效、可扩展的教师培训工具的关键。

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Conclusion: VLT预训练和轻量级RL微调是实现鲁棒自动驾驶的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025
Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These
results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL
fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.

Result: 在GemBench数据集的四个泛化级别上，Gondola均优于现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: Gondola通过多视角输入和视觉语言规划，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All

isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and
security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and
adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with
deployment practices and applicability across industries including

TL;DR: SAIL（模仿学习的速度适应）是一种新方法，通过动态调整执行速度，使机器人策略能够以比演示数据更快的速度执行任务，实验证明其速度提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法受限于演示数据的速度，限制了机器人系统的任务吞吐量，尤其是在工业自动化等需要高效率的应用中。

Method: SAIL整合了四个关键组件：一致性保持的动作推断算法、高保真运动目标跟踪、自适应速度调制和动作调度，以解决机器人动力学和状态-动作分布偏移的挑战。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人平台上，SAIL实现了最高4倍（仿真）和3.2倍（真实世界）的速度提升。

Conclusion: SAIL为模仿学习中的速度适应问题提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了任务执行效率。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

TL;DR: Brain2Vec是一种新型深度学习工具，结合卷积、循环和注意力机制，用于从原始EEG信号中分类压力状态，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理压力对认知健康和整体幸福感的影响日益普遍，需要开发非侵入性诊断工具。EEG信号虽能直接反映神经活动，但其非平稳性和高维度特性带来建模挑战。

Method: Brain2Vec采用混合架构，包括卷积层（捕捉空间依赖）、LSTM层（建模时序模式）和注意力机制（突出关键时间区域）。预处理包括带通滤波、z-score归一化和分段。

Result: 在DEAP数据集上，Brain2Vec的AUC得分为0.68，验证准确率为81.25%，优于传统CNN-LSTM基线。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec有望集成到可穿戴压力监测平台和个性化医疗系统中。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

Motivation: ECG信号常受噪声干扰，影响临床诊断准确性，现有方法标注不一致且泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 该方法提升临床决策、诊断准确性及实时监测能力，适用于临床和可穿戴ECG应用。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Main category: eess.AS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR后处理方法（ED-CEC）在纠正罕见词时表现良好，但对发音相似但拼写不同的同音词纠错效果不佳，且存在错误检测过度的问题。

Method: 在ED-CEC基础上引入音素增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），并加入保留概率机制以过滤低置信度的编辑操作。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，PMF-CEC在保持合理推理速度的同时，进一步降低了偏置词错误率，尤其在同音词纠错上表现更优。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC在推理速度和鲁棒性上优于其他上下文偏置方法，且在大型偏置列表下仍表现良好。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

Method: 采用参数、嵌入和损失三种正则化方法改进联邦学习过程。

Result: 实验表明，正则化联邦学习系统显著优于基线FedAvg系统，WER相对降低2.13%。

Conclusion: 正则化联邦学习在隐私保护下有效提升了语音识别性能，接近集中式训练效果。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Abstract: Transforming sound insights into actionable streams of data, this abstract
leverages findings from degree thesis research to enhance automotive system
intelligence, enabling us to address road type [1].By extracting and
interpreting acoustic signatures from microphones installed within the
wheelbase of a car, we focus on classifying road type.Utilizing deep neural
networks and feature extraction powered by pre-trained models from the Open AI
ecosystem (via Hugging Face [2]), our approach enables Autonomous Driving and
Advanced Driver- Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) to anticipate road surfaces,
support adaptive learning for active road noise cancellation, and generate
valuable insights for urban planning. The results of this study were
specifically captured to support a compelling business case for next-generation
automotive systems. This forward-looking approach not only promises to redefine
passenger comfort and improve vehicle safety, but also paves the way for
intelligent, data-driven urban road management, making the future of mobility

Method: 采用Whisper和指令调优的LLMs，通过提示改进儿童语音识别转录，并评估其在阅读错误检测中的效果。

Result: 最佳系统在荷兰儿童朗读语音中实现了5.1%的词错误率（WER），优于基线9.4%，阅读错误检测F1分数从0.39提升至0.73。

Conclusion: 提示Whisper和LLMs显著提升了语音识别和阅读错误检测性能，为自动朗读评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on
reading evaluation systems and applications remains limited. We present a novel
multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child
speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading
mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without
prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art recognition
performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%,
improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved
reading mistake detection, increasing the F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

Method: 通过听力和转录测试评估五种TTS模型，使用LLM生成LaTeX MX的英文发音，并采用用户评分和转录正确性指标量化结果。

Result: TTS模型对MX的输出可理解性不足，且表现显著差于专家朗读；LLM选择的影响有限。

Conclusion: 需改进TTS模型以更好地处理MX。

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过多阶段处理生成伪标签，存在错误传播、信息丢失和优化不连贯的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多ASR提示驱动框架，结合文本或语音LLM进行后处理，替代传统的投票或仲裁逻辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在转录准确性上显著优于传统方法，且在半监督ASR模型训练中表现更优。

Conclusion: 统一的多ASR框架结合LLM后处理是一种高效且准确的伪标签生成方法，适用于半监督ASR训练。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有语音处理工具缺乏验证，可能导致行为相关信息的捕捉不可靠，影响模型的可重复性和公平性，尤其是在多样化的群体和情境中。

Method: 通过评估OpenSMILE和Praat提取的语音特征，分析其在自闭症青少年中的可靠性及其对模型性能的影响。

Result: 发现不同工具提取的特征存在显著差异，这些差异影响了模型在不同情境和人口群体中的表现。

Conclusion: 建议进行领域相关的验证，以提高机器学习模型在临床应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在音频-视觉任务中表现优异，但其依赖第三方数据和开源模型带来了安全风险，现有研究缺乏对各种攻击类型的统一综述。

Method: 通过系统综述音频-视觉攻击，包括对抗攻击、后门攻击和越狱攻击，并分析最新MLLMs中的攻击类型。

Result: 揭示了MLLMs的安全漏洞，总结了攻击类型及其影响，填补了现有研究的空白。

Conclusion: 未来研究需关注音频-视觉攻击与防御的挑战与新兴趋势，以提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成图像的真实性提升，版权和滥用问题日益突出，现有单域水印方法的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出双域水印方法，使用流水线注入器在空间和频率域中嵌入水印，并引入GNR优化提取的高斯噪声以增强检测鲁棒性。

Result: GaussMarker在八种图像失真和四种高级攻击下，在三个版本的Stable Diffusion中实现了最优性能，召回率更高且误报率更低。

Conclusion: 双域水印方法结合GNR显著提升了水印的鲁棒性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务行业的持续增长导致信用卡欺诈增多，分析师因处理大量警报而疲劳，需要自动化工具辅助。

Method: FAA框架利用LLM的推理、代码执行和视觉能力，分七步完成调查，包括规划、证据收集和分析。

Result: 对500起信用卡欺诈调查的实证评估显示，FAA框架能可靠且高效地完成调查。

Conclusion: FAA框架可自动化大部分工作，有效减轻欺诈分析师的工作负担。

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations

state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

Conclusion: 差分隐私在机器学习中具有重要潜力，但也面临挑战，如对抗攻击的脆弱性。本文为安全AI系统的发展提供了全面概述。

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过将数据集重构为一系列随时间变化的训练和测试标签，以验证模型是否真正学习。研究发现，大多数模型的性能并未随时间提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞数据集在ML测试中隐含了回顾性信息，导致过去性能与未来表现不一致。传统方法要么过于乐观（使用全部历史数据），要么过于保守（仅考虑连续发布版本）。

Method: 提出一种方法，将数据集重构为一系列随时间变化的训练和测试标签，并使用Mann-Kendall检验验证模型是否学习。

Result: 在4个时间数据集和5种ML模型上的验证表明，性能随时间变化不一致，大多数模型并未真正学习。

Conclusion: 模型性能并未因更多数据而提升，表明当前模型在漏洞检测中的学习能力有限。

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its

  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,

This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the

Motivation: 探索球迷情绪表达与球队表现之间的关系，为体育分析、社交媒体动态和球迷参与研究提供新视角。

Method: 对83支球队的Instagram评论进行情感分析，提取时间情绪模式，并基于复杂系统理论分析情绪分布。

Result: 愤怒情绪的突发性与球队排名显著相关，忽略突发性指标会降低模型解释力32%。

Conclusion: 球迷情绪表达与球队表现密切相关，突发性指标可作为预测球队表现的有力工具。

Abstract: This study investigates the emotional dynamics of Italian soccer fandoms
through computational analysis of user-generated content from official
Instagram accounts of 83 teams across Serie A, Serie B, and Lega Pro during the
2023-24 season. By applying sentiment analysis to fan comments, we extract
temporal emotional patterns and identify distinct clusters of fan bases with
similar preseason expectations. Drawing from complex systems theory, we
characterize joy as displaying anti-bursty temporal distributions, while anger
is marked by pronounced bursty patterns. Our analysis reveals significant
correlations between these emotional signals, preseason expectations,
socioeconomic factors, and final league rankings. In particular, the burstiness
metric emerges as a meaningful correlate of team performance; statistical
models excluding this parameter show a decrease in the coefficient of
determination of 32%. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship
between fan emotional expression and team outcomes, suggesting potential
avenues for research in sports analytics, social media dynamics, and fan
engagement studies.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FPGA在平衡性能和灵活性方面存在挑战，而AMD Versal ACAP架构的AI Engines（AIEs）因内存带宽不足未能充分发挥潜力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了两种计算单元（Conv PE和DWC PE），优化数据流以利用数据复用机会，并扩展PE功能以利用AIEs进行非卷积操作。

Result: 实验表明，相比传统FPGA设计，DPUV4E在TOPS/W上提升了8.6倍，资源占用大幅减少，延迟降低至68.5%，吞吐量最高提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: DPUV4E设计显著提升了Versal架构的性能和能效，为AI应用提供了高效的加速方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Kuiper统计量的新度量方法，用于衡量多校准性，并通过信号噪声比加权子群体贡献，避免了传统分箱或核密度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中预测概率很少完全多校准，因此需要一种度量方法来衡量与完美多校准的距离。

Method: 基于Kuiper统计量提出新度量方法，通过信号噪声比加权子群体贡献。

Result: 新度量方法在基准数据集上的数值示例中表现良好，且忽略信号噪声比会导致度量结果噪声增加。

Conclusion: 新提出的度量方法有效解决了多校准性问题，并通过信号噪声比优化了子群体的贡献权重。

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

### [241] [HQFNN: A Compact Quantum-Fuzzy Neural Network for Accurate Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11146)
*Jianhong Yao,Yangming Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: HQFNN结合模糊推理与量子电路，实现高效、鲁棒的图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在噪声环境下表现不佳及模型解释性差的问题。

Method: 通过量子电路实现模糊推理，结合轻量级CNN提取特征。

Result: 在标准图像基准测试中表现优于经典、模糊增强及纯量子方法，且参数效率高。

Conclusion: HQFNN为紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的视觉模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

TL;DR: 使用预训练的生物学基础模型和染色质可及性数据，显著提升了CRISPR-Cas12基因组编辑中gRNA活性的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据有限、PAM序列的多样性以及依赖大规模训练，预测gRNA活性具有挑战性。研究探索了预训练的转录组学基础模型是否能提升预测效果。

Method: 利用现有RNA基础模型的嵌入作为轻量级回归器的输入，并结合染色质可及性数据。

Result: 结果显示，该方法显著优于传统基线方法，进一步整合染色质数据后性能更优。

Conclusion: 预训练的基础模型和染色质数据对gRNA活性预测非常有效。

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12
genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across
protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight
regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also
integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity
prediction.

for autonomous, scalable, and iterative analysis in social science domains
maintaining data privacy through offline execution.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 比较概率图模型（PGMs）和图神经网络（GNNs）在图数据中的表现，发现PGMs在低维或噪声特征及高异质性图中更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨PGMs和GNNs在捕捉网络数据信息时的差异，特别是在特征处理、噪声鲁棒性和异质性适应方面的表现。

Method: 通过链接预测任务进行实验，包括特征处理、噪声特征和高异质性图的测试，并比较计算复杂性和可解释性。

Result: PGMs在低维或噪声特征及高异质性图中表现优于GNNs。

Conclusion: PGMs在特定场景下（如特征简单或噪声多）更具优势，而GNNs在复杂特征下可能表现更好。

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI和数字工具普及背景下，人类认知系统可能因外部依赖而退化的现象。

Method: 结合神经科学和认知心理学，分析AI工具对记忆巩固的干扰，并讨论实证研究结果。

Result: 发现过度依赖AI会阻碍记忆检索、纠错和模式构建，影响长期学习和专业能力。

Conclusion: 建议在教育和职业培训中重视内部认知模型的培养，以优化人机协作。

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对数据表示、主权和治理的特殊需求，以及专有AI基础设施的战略优势，促使医疗组织开发专有基础模型。

Method: 通过实证证据、经济框架和组织案例研究，分析专有基础模型的优势。

Result: 专有基础模型能提升临床性能、加强数据治理、创造竞争优势并加速创新。

Conclusion: 专有基础模型开发是前瞻性医疗组织的核心能力，为领导者提供了构建与购买决策的框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI研究人员和公众对具有主观体验的AI系统的看法及其治理需求。

Method: 调查582名AI研究人员和838名美国公众，分析他们对AI系统主观体验的预测和态度。

Result: 多数人认为本世纪可能出现此类AI系统，但对时间线和治理措施存在分歧。

Conclusion: 需要多学科合作评估AI主观体验，并提前制定风险防范措施。

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种交互式跨模态学习框架（ICL），通过人机交互增强文本查询的区分能力，并引入测试时人机交互模块（THI）和数据增强策略（RDA），显著提升了文本到图像行人重识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因网络架构和数据质量的固有限制，难以区分具有挑战性的候选图像，因此需要一种新方法来提升文本查询的区分能力。

Method: 提出了ICL框架，包含THI模块（通过多轮交互与多模态大语言模型对齐查询意图）和RDA策略（通过信息丰富和多样性增强优化训练文本）。

Result: 在四个TIReID基准测试（CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES、RSTPReid和UFine6926）上取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: ICL框架通过人机交互和数据增强有效提升了文本到图像行人重识别的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Result: 随机森林分类器实现了88.58%的准确率，并能识别不同严重程度的阅读障碍。

Conclusion: 结合眼动追踪和机器学习为非侵入式诊断提供了高准确性和可及性的解决方案。

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Conclusion: 建议采用严格的方法评估数据宇宙发现的实用性，以促进数据科学的整体发展。

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Motivation: 集中式训练的基础模型存在隐私和高传输成本问题，而联邦学习（FL）和个性化联邦学习（PFL）提供了分布式解决方案，但现有研究多局限于模拟环境，忽略了真实场景中的异构性问题。

Method: 提出任务相似性感知的模型聚合方法解决数据异构性，设计维度不变模块解决模型异构性。

Result: 在包含40个任务的真实多模态PFL基准测试中，该方法在个性化和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了真实场景中的异构性问题，为个性化联邦学习的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital

Result: 模型在数学逻辑问题基准测试中表现出推理质量、代码准确性和逻辑正确性的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏训练资源的编程语言提供了有效的代码生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Conclusion: 研究为传染病预测中的移动数据表示提供了新视角，有助于决策者更好地应对未来疫情。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Motivation: 传统的时间序列预测方法（直接或递归）存在局限性，需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 采用非因果、双向注意力编码器-仅转换器结构，通过掩码令牌恢复训练，并结合多输入集成减少输出方差。

Result: 在ETT和Weather数据集上零样本任务中表现优异，300M参数模型在GIFT-Eval基准测试中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: YingLong框架在时间序列预测中表现出色，尤其是长输出任务，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FTP（Forward Target Propagation）的生物合理且计算高效的替代方法，取代了传统的反向传播（BP），解决了BP在生物和硬件上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播（BP）存在对称权重、非局部信用分配和反向传递时活动冻结等问题，限制了其在生物和硬件上的应用。

Method: FTP通过第二次前向传递替代反向传递，利用前馈计算估计层间目标，无需对称反馈权重或可学习的逆函数，实现模块化和局部学习。

Result: FTP在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100上达到与BP相当的准确率，并在低精度和新兴硬件约束下表现更优，计算效率显著高于其他生物启发方法。

Conclusion: FTP以其计算开销小、纯前向特性和硬件兼容性，为高效能设备学习和神经形态计算提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本检测AI生成图像的方法，通过任务对齐提示（zero-shot-s²）显著提升性能，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成越来越逼真的图像，对其潜在滥用的担忧增加，而传统监督检测方法难以泛化。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过任务对齐提示（如zero-shot-s²）改进零样本检测性能。

Result: zero-shot-s²方法在多个数据集和模型上显著提升性能（Macro F1提高8%-29%），并展示出强泛化能力和模型规模鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发VLMs的潜在能力，为AI生成图像检测提供了一种简单、通用且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

*Minjae Kwon,Tyler Ingebrand,Ufuk Topcu,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时屏蔽机制，用于强化学习中隐藏参数变化的安全风险，通过实时推断和预测确保安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏参数（如机器人质量分布或摩擦）的变化在执行过程中可能带来安全风险，需要一种机制来实时适应和约束行为。

Method: 基于约束隐藏参数马尔可夫决策过程，利用函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，并通过保形预测处理不确定性，约束动作空间以避免未来安全风险。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少安全违规，并实现强泛化能力，同时运行时开销极小。

Conclusion: 提出的机制满足概率安全保证，并在安全合规策略集中实现最优策略。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在因果推理任务中表现出色，但视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉因果推理任务中的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 作者构建了一个包含因果结构推断、干预目标预测和反事实预测三个任务的基准，并在三个因果表示学习数据集上评估了现有LVLMs的表现。

Result: 研究揭示了现有LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的优势和不足。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在推动改进LVLMs视觉因果推理能力的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并将其应用于深度学习中的神经网络模块，如Tversky投影层，实验表明其在图像分类和语言建模任务中优于传统的线性投影层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理学研究表明，深度学习中常用的几何相似性模型与人类感知不符，而Tversky的基于特征的相似性理论更符合心理学实际，但尚未在深度学习中应用。

Method: 开发了一种可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并设计了Tversky投影层，通过梯度下降进行学习。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层相对线性层提升了24.7%的准确率；在GPT-2的PTB数据集上，困惑度降低7.5%，参数减少34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种新的相似性建模范式，同时提升了模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Motivation: CFG在提高文本-图像对齐的同时会导致颜色失真，作者旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ADG算法，通过约束幅度变化并优化角度对齐来减少颜色失真。

Result: ADG显著优于现有方法，生成图像在文本对齐和颜色保真度上表现更优。

Conclusion: ADG有效解决了CFG的颜色失真问题，同时保持了高质量的文本-图像对齐。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

TL;DR: CMuSeNet是一种基于复数神经网络的宽带频谱感知网络，通过引入复数傅里叶频谱焦点损失和复数平面交并比相似性度量，显著提升了低信噪比环境下的信号检测性能和训练效率。

Method: 提出CMuSeNet，采用复数神经网络和残差架构，并引入复数傅里叶频谱焦点损失（CFL）和复数平面交并比（CIoU）相似性度量。

Result: 在合成、室内无线和真实数据集上，CMuSeNet平均准确率达到98.98%-99.90%，比实数神经网络提升高达9.2个百分点，训练时间减少92.2%。

Conclusion: 复数神经网络架构在低信噪比环境下显著提升了频谱感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Conclusion: STRCMP框架通过结构感知的LLM方法，为组合优化问题提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务中，ADAMIX分别以22.3%和6.1%的优势超越最佳基线Delta-CoMe。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过自适应混合精度压缩策略，显著提升了delta压缩的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

TL;DR: SectorE是一种基于极坐标的知识图谱嵌入模型，通过将关系建模为环形扇区，有效捕捉语义层次结构，并在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱补全（KGC）对下游任务至关重要，但现有区域嵌入模型常忽略实体的语义层次结构。

Method: 提出SectorE模型，将关系建模为环形扇区，实体嵌入为扇区内的点，结合模和相位捕捉推理模式和关系属性。

Result: 在FB15k-237、WN18RR和YAGO3-10数据集上，SectorE表现优异，尤其在语义建模能力上。

Conclusion: SectorE通过极坐标嵌入有效解决了语义层次结构问题，为知识图谱补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列数据在不同粒度上呈现状态，现有方法无法统一处理多粒度且适应性不足。

Method: 提出PromptTSS框架，利用提示机制结合标签和边界信息，动态适应新模式。

Result: 实验显示PromptTSS在多粒度分割、单粒度分割和迁移学习中分别提升24.49%、17.88%和599.24%的准确率。

Conclusion: PromptTSS能有效处理多粒度状态并适应动态环境，为时间序列分割提供新思路。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对离线强化学习的数据-策略覆盖毒化攻击（CSDPC），通过序列级可集中系数量化覆盖，并揭示了其对估计误差的指数放大效应。实验表明，仅毒化1%的数据即可使智能体性能下降90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究关注提升数据-策略覆盖以减少分布偏移，但忽视了覆盖不足的安全风险，且单步分析不符合离线RL的多步决策特性。

Method: 引入序列级可集中系数量化覆盖，提出CSDPC毒化攻击，将状态-动作对转化为决策单元，提取代表性决策模式并毒化稀有模式以减少覆盖。

Result: 毒化1%的数据可使智能体性能下降90%。

Conclusion: 该研究为离线RL的安全分析和防护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中动态融合策略（如注意力机制）因模型偏好单一模态而失效，导致动态适应性下降。

Method: 提出RollingQ方法，通过旋转查询平衡注意力分配，打破自强化循环并缩小模态间的键分布差距。

Result: 实验验证RollingQ能有效恢复多模态Transformer的动态适应性，提升性能。

Conclusion: RollingQ通过恢复合作动态，增强了多模态Transformer的广泛能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT方法（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时，可能因依赖虚假标记（SSTI）导致模型行为被操控。研究发现，仅需少量标记即可控制模型决策，且LoRA秩的大小影响模型对虚假标记的依赖程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PEFT方法在高效微调中的潜在失败模式，尤其是模型对虚假标记的依赖问题。

Method: 通过Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI)技术，在不同模型和数据集上测试PEFT对虚假标记的敏感性。

Result: 发现仅需一个虚假标记即可操控模型决策；LoRA秩的大小与对虚假标记的依赖程度相关；高秩LoRA在强SSTI下能提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEFT方法需警惕虚假标记的潜在风险，高秩LoRA在特定情况下能增强模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

Result: 实验表明BRRA攻击能显著增强模型偏见，同时提出了双阶段防御机制。

Conclusion: RAG系统的投毒攻击会直接放大模型偏见，需关注其公平性问题。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential
for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

Result: 理论框架解释了多项实证现象，并统一了先前的梯度分析和分布分析。

Conclusion: 首次将推理时的注意力机制形式化为蒸馏过程，为未来提示工程和自动化演示选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Conclusion: 本文强调了长期公平性的重要性，并通过因果分解和简单方法为动态决策系统中的公平性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Motivation: 现有BEM解决方案依赖特定任务和数据的模型，限制了广泛适用性。TSFMs有望通过通用性解决这一问题。

Method: 评估TSFMs在四个维度：零样本单变量预测、协变量预测、零样本表示学习和鲁棒性测试。

Result: TSFMs通用性有限，表现仅略优于统计模型，协变量处理不佳，对复杂环境适应性差。

Conclusion: 需改进TSFMs设计，特别是协变量处理和上下文整合，以实现更适应和可扩展的BEM解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Result: 在EpicKitchens、COCO和CC12M等无标签图像数据上实验，展示了改进的特征表示。

Conclusion: 通过RL框架，可以更灵活地利用无标签图像数据（如视频、场景和网络爬取数据）进行特征学习。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

TL;DR: EMLoC是一个基于模拟器的内存高效微调框架，通过LoRA校正技术，实现在推理所需内存预算内完成模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但微调大模型对大多数用户来说内存开销过高，限制了其应用。

Method: EMLoC利用激活感知SVD构建轻量级模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正压缩模拟器与原模型的不对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明，EMLoC在多个数据集和模态上优于其他基线方法，且能在单张24GB消费级GPU上微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个体用户提供了高效且实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Motivation: 强化学习（RL）在提升LLM推理能力方面效果显著，但数据效率低下是主要瓶颈。

Method: 基于梯度对齐和成功率的LearnAlign方法，智能选择可学习和代表性的训练数据。

Result: 在三个数学推理基准测试中，显著减少数据需求（如GSM8K上减少1000点），性能优于全数据训练（77.53% vs 77.04%）。

Conclusion: 为数据高效的RL后训练提供了新思路，并为未来推理数据选择优化奠定基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to
avert or mitigate the severe health complications of this disease. Over recent
years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting
diabetes risk and are beneficial for practitioners. Objective: This study
highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical
machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from
the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic
and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels
that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation
assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy
and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The
results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive
accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second
position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning
techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act
as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health
outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VUR诊断存在主观性，机器学习可提供客观标准。

Method: 选取113张VCUG图像，提取9个特征，训练6种模型，采用留一法交叉验证。

Result: 模型分类准确，无假阳性或假阴性，肾盏变形是高等级VUR的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 机器学习可替代主观评估，未来需扩大数据集并优化模型。

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Motivation: 现有方法通常专注于任务特定模型定制，而忽视了时间序列数据的内在特征（时间序列原语），导致成本高、灵活性差和效率低。

Method: 提出三种对齐范式：注入对齐、桥接对齐和内部对齐，分别针对时间序列原语的不同方面（领域、特征和表示）。

Result: 通过优先考虑数据内在特征，激活LLMs的时间序列推理能力，实现经济、灵活和高效的推理。

Conclusion: 建议实践者采用对齐导向的方法，选择适当的对齐范式，并展望了相关研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态懒惰和模态冲突问题，现有方法无法同时实现单模态充分性和多模态平衡。

Method: 提出多模态数据重混合，包括解耦数据、过滤困难样本和批量级重组。

Result: 实验显示方法在CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds数据集上分别提升约6.50%和3.41%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外计算开销即可提升多模态学习效果，且与现有方法兼容。

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

Motivation: 提高训练样本质量对提升机器学习模型的可靠性和性能至关重要。本文旨在评估不同影响力信号在检测训练数据问题（如错误标记和异常样本）中的效果。

Method: 通过实验比较多种影响力信号（如自影响力、平均绝对影响力等），使用共同的影响力估计器（如TraceIn），在不同数据模态（图像和表格）和深度学习模型中进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，自影响力等信号能有效检测错误标记样本，但现有信号均无法检测异常样本。部分信号因未考虑训练动态或影响力抵消效应而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现有影响力信号在检测错误标记样本方面有效，但在异常样本检测上存在局限性，需进一步改进以考虑训练动态和影响力抵消问题。

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过研究涌现性错位，为理解和缓解模型错位行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Conclusion: 结论指出，研究者需谨慎使用基于扰动的评估方法，并建议开发更全面的评估框架以捕捉归因质量的多个维度。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular
networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By
integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an
attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our
reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in
vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our
approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation
process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention
mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC
services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved
from 71.44% to 73.21%.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在无线电信号分类中表现优异，但对抗扰动会显著降低其性能，尤其是数据无关的通用对抗扰动。因此，研究防御方法具有重要意义。

Method: 通过设计神经拒绝系统，并生成白盒通用对抗扰动来评估其防御性能。

Result: 神经拒绝系统能显著提高对通用对抗扰动的防御准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的神经拒绝系统是一种有效的防御通用对抗扰动的方法。

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

TL;DR: XAStruct是一个机器学习框架，用于从晶体结构预测XAS光谱，并从XAS输入推断局部结构描述符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAS的解释需要专家分析、计算成本高的模拟和元素特定的启发式方法，限制了其应用。

Method: XAStruct通过深度学习神经网络和高效基线模型，训练于覆盖70多种元素的大规模数据集。

Result: 模型能预测邻近原子类型和平均最近邻距离，但端到端模型性能下降，因此任务独立训练。

Conclusion: XAStruct为数据驱动的XAS分析和局部结构推断提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 强化学习代理可能因策略混淆而依赖虚假相关性，影响泛化能力。

Method: 通过优势函数调整动作值，减少对当前策略下高概率状态-动作对的依赖。

Result: 优势函数训练显著提升了代理在非轨迹数据上的表现。

Conclusion: 优势函数是缓解策略混淆的有效工具，有助于提升强化学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Conclusion: 预训练在学习和泛化语音表示中具有重要性。

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This

wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech
representations.

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SimPhon Speech Test-25的新型语音测试方法，通过计算模拟和优化，解决了传统听力测试在评估老年性耳聋患者语音理解功能上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试对老年性耳聋患者的语音理解功能评估不全面，尤其是超阈值听力损失。因此，需要开发更具诊断特异性的语音感知测试方法。

Method: 利用自动语音识别系统模拟人类听者的感知效果，通过多阶段计算流程设计并验证了一种语音平衡的最小对语音测试方法。

Result: 最终优化的25对测试项目（SimPhon Speech Test-25）的诊断性能与标准语音可懂度指数无显著相关性，表明该方法能捕捉超出简单可听性的感知缺陷。

Conclusion: SimPhon Speech Test-25为听力测试开发提供了高效的计算优化方法，并准备进行初步人体试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

Motivation: 统一语音和音乐模型通常需要昂贵的预训练，而直接合并未对齐的模型具有挑战性。

Method: 采用相关性排列方法，逐层计算最大化特征交叉相关性的排列矩阵，合并Transformer层。

Result: 合并模型在音乐性能上平均得分提升14.83分，优于线性插值合并方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可从独立训练的编码器中创建统一的音频模型。

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

Motivation: 研究如何通过声音融合生成抽象声音，即不泄露真实世界声音事件的声音。

Method: 采用基于DPMSolver++采样器的SDE和ODE反转模型，通过配置模型输出为常数来消除噪声预测项的循环依赖。

Result: 提出的反转方法无需提示条件，同时在采样过程中保持灵活的引导。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了声音融合，生成具有超越叠加特性的新声音。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

Conclusion: 该系统重新定义了AI在表演艺术中的角色，使其成为响应式合作者，为专业舞蹈和即兴艺术表达提供了更多可能性。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

Method: 通过实验评估多种INRs和网格表示在2D和3D信号（包括真实和合成信号）上的性能，任务涵盖断层扫描、超分辨率和去噪。

Result: 大多数任务中，正则化网格比相同参数量的INRs训练更快且质量更高；但在拟合低维结构信号时，INRs表现更优。

Conclusion: INRs在特定任务中具有优势，未来应将其应用于最适合的场景，如处理低维结构信号。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

Conclusion: ADAgent是首个专为AD设计的AI代理，能有效支持多模态诊断和决策，性能显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D卷积模型在处理树状几何数据时内存需求高，且难以保持拓扑结构一致性，因此需要一种更高效且精确的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer自编码器：第一阶段（Vessel Autoencoder）学习血管段的几何细节，第二阶段（Vessel Tree Autoencoder）编码血管网络拓扑结构。

Result: 在2D合成树数据集和3D冠状动脉数据集上表现优异，重建保真度高，拓扑结构准确，且支持潜在空间插值。

Conclusion: VeTTA框架为医学影像中的树状结构提供了精确、灵活且拓扑一致的建模方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中过平滑问题导致QPI图像细节丢失，尤其是高频诊断细节。研究发现高频跳跃连接加剧了频谱偏差，限制了网络的性能。

Method: 提出DiffPR框架：第一阶段使用不对称U-Net（取消高频跳跃连接）预测低频相位图；第二阶段通过无条件扩散模型恢复高频细节。

Result: 在四个QPI数据集上，DiffPR显著优于U-Net基线，PSNR提升1.1 dB，MAE降低11%，图像细节更清晰。

Conclusion: 取消高频跳跃连接并利用扩散模型合成细节，是解决频谱偏差的有效方法，显著提升了相位恢复网络的性能。

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

Result: 在合成数据上，相对MSE降低45%（SNR=0.03）。

Conclusion: 该方法在高噪声环境下优于单图像DNN，展示了Transformer在冷冻电镜图像处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

Result: FAD-Net在分割中达到0.8717的Dice系数，狭窄检测的TPR和PPV分别为0.6140和0.6398，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAD-Net在CAD的精确诊断和治疗规划中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率CT成像对医疗诊断至关重要，但辐射剂量与图像质量之间存在矛盾。现有深度学习方法在复杂退化和有限医学数据下表现不佳。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion模型，结合合成的低质量图像和预训练视觉语言模型生成的描述，进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能在降低辐射剂量的同时实现高质量CT成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为高分辨率CT成像提供了一种有效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于压缩驱动降维的高效视频超分辨率方法，显著减少计算复杂度和推理时间，同时保持或超越现有SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法存在推理时间长、训练流程复杂、依赖辅助信息等问题，且传统帧间信息利用方法难以满足高帧率视频需求。

Method: 受高光谱图像与视频数据相似性启发，提出压缩驱动降维策略，降低计算复杂度并增强帧间时序信息提取，模块化设计便于与现有框架集成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与或优于当前SOTA模型，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频超分辨率技术提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，解决了关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑网络基础模型研究有限且局限于单一维度，限制了其在神经科学中的广泛应用。

Method: 模型包含两个模块：(1)适配器模块扩展脑区特征；(2)基于自监督学习的微调基础模型，利用Transformer提取特征和计算区域关联。

Result: 实验表明模型在脑疾病诊断中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型为脑网络分析研究提供了有前景的新方法。

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

Motivation: 医学影像中神经网络模型的应用受到隐私法规、数据稀缺、高成本及人口偏见的限制，深度生成模型可通过合成数据解决这些问题。

Method: 研究比较了基于大型基础模型的距离损失函数与感知损失和边缘检测损失函数的效果。

Result: 研究发现，特定领域的深度特征并未改善图像生成效果，而传统边缘检测滤波器显著提升了血管结构的清晰度。

Conclusion: 传统边缘检测滤波器在医学影像合成中表现更优，特定领域的深度特征未带来额外优势。

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and

Main category: eess.IV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法通过增加模型深度或使用注意力机制扩大感受野，但导致复杂度增加；模型驱动方法通过展开范式在保持紧凑性的同时提升性能。SSIU旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 基于展开范式设计，每轮迭代包含混合尺度门控模块（MSGM）和高效稀疏注意力模块（ESAM），并引入专家混合特征选择器（MoE-FS）利用多级特征。

Result: 实验表明，SSIU在性能上优于当前最优模型，同时参数更少、内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: SSIU通过结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

Motivation: 开发一种参数和内存高效的模型，以在多模态头图像中实现高性能的颅骨剥离，同时降低计算资源需求。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构，仅使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在606例多模态脑扫描中，MindGrab的平均Dice得分为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当或更好，且参数减少95%。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高性能的同时，显著降低了资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

TL;DR: 该论文分析了crossMoDA挑战赛的进展，从2021年到2023年，任务从单机构数据扩展到多机构数据，并增加了临床复杂性。结果显示，数据多样性提高了分割性能，但肿瘤子注释增加了复杂性。

Motivation: 通过跨模态域适应挑战赛，研究如何从对比增强T1 MRI迁移到T2 MRI，以自动化前庭神经鞘瘤和耳蜗分割，降低成本并提高临床管理效率。

Method: 回顾性分析了2022年和2023年的挑战赛结果，包括数据集扩展、任务复杂性的增加（如Koos分级和肿瘤子分割），并评估了性能变化。

Result: 数据多样性减少了异常值，但肿瘤子注释导致耳蜗分割性能下降。2023年的获胜方法在早期测试数据上表现更好，表明数据异质性对性能有积极影响。

Conclusion: 尽管在临床可接受的分割上仍需改进，但性能趋于稳定，未来可能需要更具挑战性的跨模态任务作为基准。

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的高能耗引发广泛讨论，但缺乏科学证据支持FtS策略在减少碳足迹方面的优势。

Method: 在部分合成场景中，对四种异常检测AI算法进行实验，比较无策略、FtS及两种现有策略的碳排放差异。

Result: FtS策略平均减少14.6%碳排放（峰值16.3%），同时保持训练时间。

Conclusion: FtS策略有效减少AI工作负载的碳足迹，且不影响训练效率。

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

Result: 在真实后端系统中验证了50%的测试需求，每个API平均成本仅2.19美元，显著优于人工测试。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的AI驱动软件测试提供了有前景的方向，有望大幅提升工程效率。

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

Conclusion: 该框架有效验证了代码翻译的语义等价性，并为AI模型的改进提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的AI就绪框架，用于评估军事系统中AI组件的成熟度和可信度，以弥补现有技术就绪评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的技术就绪评估未能涵盖AI特有的关键因素，导致部署时存在潜在风险。

Method: 提出了一种类似于传统技术就绪水平（TRL）但针对AI扩展的框架，结合现有数据评估工具和测试实践。

Result: 框架的可行性得到验证，为军事决策者提供了更清晰的AI系统性能、透明度和人机集成标准。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提升AI军事系统的可靠性和安全性，推动国防技术管理和风险评估的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EmbedAgent是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在嵌入式系统开发中能力的范式，提出了Embedbench基准测试，覆盖多种任务，发现LLMs表现参差不齐，并提出改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估LLMs在嵌入式系统开发中的能力，尤其是在数字与物理系统结合的任务中。

Method: 提出EmbedAgent范式和Embedbench基准测试，包含126个案例，覆盖9种电子组件和3种硬件平台，测试10种主流LLMs。

Result: LLMs在不同任务中表现差异显著，例如DeepSeek-R1在生成原理图时通过率仅为50%，而在跨平台迁移任务中表现较好。改进策略显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在嵌入式系统开发中潜力巨大但仍有局限，通过检索增强生成和编译器反馈可显著提升其表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在现代编程语言任务中表现出色，但对其在遗留语言中的理解能力研究不足，尤其是在缺乏或不准确文档的情况下，因此需要客观评估LLMs的遗留代码理解能力。

Method: 采用多项选择题回答（MCQA）方法，定量评估LLMs对遗留代码的理解能力，并研究文档（如注释）的影响。

Result: 初步研究结果显示文档的存在和准确性对LLMs理解遗留代码有显著影响。

Conclusion: 未来工作需要进一步优化评估方法，并探索如何提升LLMs对遗留代码的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

Abstract: This thesis introduces a novel methodology for the automated generation of
knowledge graphs from user stories by leveraging the advanced capabilities of
Large Language Models. Utilizing the LangChain framework as a basis, the User
Story Graph Transformer module was developed to extract nodes and relationships
from user stories using an LLM to construct accurate knowledge graphs.This
innovative technique was implemented in a script to fully automate the
knowledge graph extraction process. Additionally, the evaluation was automated
through a dedicated evaluation script, utilizing an annotated dataset for
assessment. By enhancing the visualization and understanding of user
requirements and domain concepts, this method fosters better alignment between
software functionalities and user expectations, ultimately contributing to more

*Chaitanya Ravuri,Saman Amarasinghe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为功能聚类的黑盒包装方法，通过采样多个候选程序并执行自生成测试套件，消除代码生成LLM中的幻觉错误，提供可调置信度分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码生成LLM虽然能解决大量编程问题，但仍会产生细微的错误，导致输出不可靠。

Method: 通过采样多个候选程序，执行自生成测试套件，并聚类I/O行为相同的候选程序，以最大聚类的经验质量作为置信度估计。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上，该方法将错误率从约65%降至2%，并在保守阈值下将错误率降至0%，同时仍能回答15.6%的提示。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需采样和沙盒执行，适用于闭源API和未来模型，为可靠的自主代码生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过LLM迭代生成的代码安全漏洞增加37.6%，挑战了迭代改进代码安全的假设，并强调人类验证的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在代码生成中迭代反馈对安全漏洞的影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过400个代码样本和40轮改进实验，分析四种提示策略下的安全退化情况。

Result: 五轮迭代后关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示策略产生不同漏洞模式。

Conclusion: LLM迭代改进可能引入新安全漏洞，需结合人类验证并提出实用指南以降低风险。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Librarian的方法和Minicode基准，用于评估代码代理在代码重构中的表现，结果显示Librarian在压缩率和正确性上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码代理在代码重构中的能力，以支持代码的可重用性和可维护性。

Method: 提出Librarian方法（一种采样和重排技术）和Minicode基准，用于生成可重用库。

Result: Librarian在压缩率和正确性上优于现有代码代理，压缩率提高1.6-2倍。

Conclusion: Librarian和Minicode为代码重构提供了有效工具，支持代码的可重用性和可维护性。

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Code Researcher的深度研究代理，用于生成系统代码补丁以解决崩溃问题，其在Linux内核崩溃基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统代码的复杂性和规模使得修改代码库变得困难，需要深入研究代码语义、模式和提交历史。

Method: 设计了一个多步推理的深度研究代理，通过结构化内存存储上下文并合成补丁。

Result: 在kBenchSyz基准测试中，Code Researcher的崩溃解决率为58%，显著优于SWE-agent的37.5%。

Conclusion: 全局上下文收集和多方面推理对于大型代码库至关重要，Code Researcher展示了其通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CoQuIR，一个多语言、大规模的质量感知代码检索基准，用于评估代码在正确性、效率、安全性和可维护性四个维度的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码检索基准主要关注功能相关性，忽视了软件质量的关键维度，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入CoQuIR基准，包含42,725个查询和134,907个代码片段的质量标注，并提出两种质量中心评估指标。对23种检索模型进行基准测试，并探索训练方法以提升质量感知能力。

Result: 研究发现，即使是性能最佳的模型也经常无法区分有缺陷或不安全的代码。通过合成数据集训练，模型在质量感知指标上有所提升，且不影响语义相关性。

Conclusion: 论文强调了将质量信号整合到代码检索系统中的重要性，为更可信和稳健的软件开发工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,

TL;DR: Coda是一个基于代码图的调适器，用于增强现有编程知识追踪（PKT）模型，通过识别和减少噪声信号的影响，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PKT研究主要关注代码内容与知识评估的隐式关系，但忽略了长期编程活动中的噪声信号（无关提交和微小修改），这限制了模型性能和应用。

Method: Coda将松散代码序列转换为紧凑代码图，通过语义相似性识别噪声信号，并应用聚类感知的GCN改进弱信号识别，最后通过优化约束和正则化项校正噪声影响。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，Coda在噪声编程记录下有效执行PKT任务，优于典型基线模型。

Conclusion: Coda是一种模型无关的框架，可适配大多数现有PKT解决方案，显著提升噪声环境下的知识追踪效果。

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在软件开发中的广泛应用，AI生成代码的滥用风险（如抄袭、许可证违规和不安全代码）凸显，亟需开发可靠的检测工具。现有基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法满足需求。

Method: CodeMirage通过覆盖10种编程语言、包含原始和改写代码样本，以及整合10种生产级LLM的输出，构建了一个全面的基准测试。

Result: 评估了10种代表性检测器，揭示了9个关键发现，指出了当前检测器的优势和不足。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发鲁棒且通用的AI生成代码检测器提供了严谨的测试平台，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动评估方法（LLM-as-a-Judge），用于验证和改进Bash代码生成的质量，通过双向功能匹配和逻辑表示提升模型选择与代码优化，结果显示其评估准确性与执行基准高度一致，且代码优化效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IT自动化中，自动评估和选择最佳模型以改进代码质量是关键，但传统方法（如表面相似性度量）和执行基准评估存在局限性，需要更高效的自动验证方法。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，结合双向功能匹配和逻辑表示，对Bash代码生成进行无参考自动验证和优化，并以执行基准为真值评估其效果。

Result: LLM-as-a-Judge的评估结果与执行基准高度一致（准确率提升8%），并通过反馈机制（Reflection代码代理）显著优化代码（准确率提升24%）。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在自动代码验证和优化中表现出色，为IT自动化中的模型选择和代码改进提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于本体或资产管理外壳的显式建模方法需要大量手动工作，且难以被大型语言模型（LLM）直接利用。

Method: 采用模型上下文协议（MCP），通过标准化接口暴露系统功能，供LLM代理直接使用，并在实验室制造系统中进行原型评估。

Result: 实验表明，MCP方法能实现灵活的工业自动化，无需依赖显式语义模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM驱动的生产系统中外部工具集成提供了基础，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将NL2SQL数据集转换为NL2API数据集的方法，并通过实验发现当前LLM在工具调用任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署的LLM需要处理复杂API集合，但缺乏相关数据集，因此研究如何利用现有NL2SQL数据集生成NL2API数据集。

Method: 利用SQL查询语法构建功能等效的API调用序列，基于BIRD-SQL数据集生成2500多个API，并配对自然语言查询与API序列。

Result: 实验显示，10个公开LLM在工具调用任务中完成率低（7-47%），ReACT代理提升至50%，但仍远未达到通用工具调用代理的要求。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在工具调用任务中表现不足，需进一步改进。SQL生成任务表现优于API调用任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

Abstract: How can the complexity of ML-enabled systems be managed effectively? The goal
of this research is to investigate how complexity affects ML-Enabled Systems

metrics-based architectural model to characterize the complexity of MLES. The
goal is to support architectural decisions, providing a guideline for the
inception and growth of these systems. This paper brings, side-by-side, the
architecture representation of two systems that can be used as case studies for
creating the metrics-based architectural model: the SPIRA and the Ocean Guard
MLES.

TL;DR: LLMs在编程竞赛中表现优于人类精英的说法被重新审视，研究发现LLMs在中等难度问题中仅53%通过率，高难度问题中0%通过率，且依赖工具而非推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估LLMs在编程竞赛中的表现，揭示其与人类专家的差距及局限性。

Method: 引入LiveCodeBench Pro基准，由国际竞赛奖牌得主标注问题并分析模型失败案例。

Result: LLMs在实现类问题中表现较好，但在复杂算法推理和案例分析中表现不佳，且依赖工具支持。

Conclusion: LLMs与人类顶级水平仍有显著差距，需改进代码推理能力。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

### [348] [Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559)
*Gábor Antal,Dénes Bán,Martin Isztin,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GPT-4在自动生成单元测试方面的能力，特别是针对漏洞修复的测试生成，结果表明GPT-4能生成语法正确的测试用例，但语义正确性验证有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件测试在质量保障中至关重要，但手动生成测试用例复杂且耗时。研究旨在利用GPT-4自动生成漏洞修复相关的单元测试，以减轻开发者和安全专家的负担。

Method: 使用VUL4J数据集中的真实漏洞及其修复代码，评估GPT-4生成语法和语义正确测试用例的能力，并分析代码上下文、自我纠正能力及生成测试的主观可用性。

Result: GPT-4能生成66.5%语法正确的测试用例，但仅7.5%的语义正确性可自动验证。主观评估显示生成的测试模板可进一步开发为功能完整的测试。

Conclusion: GPT-4在生成漏洞见证测试中具有潜力，虽不完全自主，但在部分自动化过程中作用显著。

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

### [349] [Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561)
*Gábor Antal,Bence Bogenfürst,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GPT-4o在修复Java漏洞时表现略逊于GPT-4，但通过优化提示策略（如结合CVE信息和代码上下文）可显著提升修复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o在自动化漏洞修复（AVR）中的表现，以及不同上下文信息对修复能力的影响。

Method: 比较GPT-4o与GPT-4在相同提示下的表现，并测试9种不同提示（含CWE/CVE信息及代码上下文）对42个漏洞的修复效果。

Result: GPT-4o平均修复率比GPT-4低11.9%，但能修复更多独特漏洞；CVE信息显著提升修复率，最佳策略为结合CVE与代码上下文。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示策略（如Top-3组合），GPT-4o修复率可达62%，表明零样本场景下集成提示策略能提升漏洞修复效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

### [350] [FeNN: A RISC-V vector processor for Spiking Neural Network acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11760)
*Zainab Aizaz,James C. Knight,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: FeNN是一种基于RISC-V的软向量处理器，专为在FPGA上模拟SNN设计，比嵌入式GPU和Loihi系统更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN能显著降低AI系统的能耗，但主流加速器（如GPU和TPU）不适合模拟SNN，FPGA因其高内存带宽和大容量片上内存更适合。

Method: 提出FeNN，采用随机舍入和饱和技术，实现高数值精度和低硬件利用率。

Result: 单个FeNN核心模拟SNN分类器的速度超过嵌入式GPU和Loihi系统。

Conclusion: FeNN是一种高效、可编程的SNN模拟解决方案，适用于从边缘到云的标准计算机应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.
