Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个驾驶数据集，用于研究酒精中毒和认知分心对驾驶行为的影响，包含52名受试者的23.7小时模拟驾驶数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动驾驶技术有所进步，但驾驶受损仍对社会造成高成本。研究旨在通过数据集支持对酒精中毒和认知分心这两种常见驾驶受损形式的研究。

Method: 数据集包含52名受试者在正常和受损条件下的模拟驾驶数据，涵盖车辆数据和驾驶员数据（如视线、音频、调查）。

Result: 数据集支持分析酒精中毒（0.10%血液酒精含量）、认知分心任务及其组合对驾驶行为的影响，以及对道路危险的反应。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

### [2] [Learning to Generate Vectorized Maps at Intersections with Multiple Roadside Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02899)
*Miao Fan,Quanxin Zheng,Shengtong Xu,Linghe Kong,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRC-VMap是一种基于视觉的端到端神经网络，用于低成本生成高清矢量地图，性能优于现有在线方法，接近高成本LiDAR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线方法依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据和人工标注，而在线方法性能有限。MRC-VMap旨在填补这一空白，提供高效、低成本的解决方案。

Method: 利用路边监控摄像头的时间对齐多方向图像，直接转换为矢量地图，减少中间模块和计算开销。

Result: 在4000个中国城市交叉口测试中，MRC-VMap性能优于现有在线方法，接近LiDAR方法的精度。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap为自动驾驶导航提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Method: 评估MLLMs在分类网球动作和识别动作序列中的表现，探索改进方法，如不同训练方式或与传统模型结合。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但研究目标是验证MLLMs在网球视频分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，未来可通过改进训练方法或结合传统模型进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Method: 采用标准化标注方法，结合GroundingDINO和YOLO-Pose进行球员定位和姿态估计，使用CNN模型进行预测。

Result: CNN模型在预测击球类型、球员位置和阵型方面优于姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为网球双打的自动化战术分析和战略建模提供了基础。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical
analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic modelling in professional
tennis.

TL;DR: 利用街景图像建模食物不安全问题，提出特征提取和门控注意力聚合的两步方法，虽预测能力稍逊，但有望补充现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物不安全是全球城市公共卫生问题，现有调查方法难以扩展，需探索新方法。

Method: 提出两步法：特征提取和门控注意力图像聚合，并与其他模型架构对比。

Result: 模型预测能力略低，但权重解释和案例研究显示其潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为补充工具，辅助城市规划者和政策制定者识别食物不安全。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种能够自主理解环境的零样本识别方法，解决现有场景方法在链式检索任务中的不足。

Method: 结合度量学习和自监督学习模型，在潜在空间估计对象分布，并引入统计可分性函数验证框架。

Result: 在开放世界和逼真环境中可靠地进行推理，并在链式检索任务中优于场景方法。

Conclusion: OBSER框架实现了零样本环境识别，为自主环境理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

### [8] [GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941)
*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏图块的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏视觉资产与游戏叙事不一致的问题，以及训练数据分布不平衡导致的视觉多样性受限。

Method: 收集艺术家创作的OpenGameArt.org游戏图块，提供语义标注，并开发低分辨率图块对象检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的游戏内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法和丰富游戏叙事内容的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

### [9] [Iterative Zoom-In: Temporal Interval Exploration for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02946)
*Chenglin Li,Qianglong Chen,fengtao,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的无训练框架，通过迭代调整时间关注区域，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间关注区域解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两阶段迭代：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间采样固定数量帧，生成响应和置信度分数。TS-BFS进一步优化搜索策略。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间关注区域，提高了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，同时降低了内存消耗。

Conclusion: TS为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，显著提升了MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过合成高风险运动数据增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的运动风险预测能力，提出BEV运动模拟方法和DriveMRP-Agent框架，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶在长尾场景中因动态环境不确定性和数据覆盖不足导致的安全预测挑战。

Method: 引入BEV运动模拟方法合成高风险数据DriveMRP-10K，并设计VLM无关的DriveMRP-Agent框架，结合全局上下文和轨迹投影。

Result: 实验显示，DriveMRP-Agent显著提升VLM性能，事故识别准确率从27.13%提升至88.03%，零样本评估准确率从29.42%提升至68.50%。

Conclusion: 方法有效增强VLM在真实场景中的风险预测和泛化能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

*C. Y. N. Dwith,Pejhman Ghassemi,Joshua Pfefer,Jon Casamento,Quanzeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于红外热成像（IRT）的发热筛查方法，通过多模态配准技术精确定位眼角区域，以实现高效、非侵入式的体温监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传染病大流行期间（如埃博拉和SARS），红外热成像技术被广泛应用于公共场所的体温监测，但需要更精确的方法定位眼角区域以提高筛查准确性。

Method: 采用粗-精配准策略，结合基于标志点和眼轮廓边缘检测的配准模型，实现红外和可见光图像的多模态配准。

Result: 配准精度在2.7毫米以内，能够精确定位眼角区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，适用于公共场所的体温监测。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

### [12] [CS-VLM: Compressed Sensing Attention for Efficient Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02957)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Preethi Raju,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSAT的新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知技术降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉语言模型（vLLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度在vLLMs中成为计算瓶颈，尤其是在跨模态计算时，内存和延迟成本过高。

Method: CSAT利用随机测量矩阵将高维键值表示投影到低维子空间，并通过稀疏恢复算法重建注意力输出。

Result: CSAT显著降低了注意力复杂度，同时在标准基准测试中保持了语义保真度。

Conclusion: CSAT是一种可扩展、可解释且资源高效的多模态变换器解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

### [13] [Unlearning the Noisy Correspondence Makes CLIP More Robust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03434)
*Haochen Han,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Peijun Ye,Fangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NCU的新框架，通过去学习噪声对应关系来提升预训练视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，避免了从头训练的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）的数据需求不断增长，但数据质量与噪声对应关系（NC）样本的引入成为问题，影响了模型性能。现有方法需从头训练，资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过去学习噪声知识（包括假阳性和假阴性）来增强模型鲁棒性，采用最优传输目标进行快速微调。

Result: 在CLIP模型上验证，NCU在零样本迁移任务中表现优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU提供了一种高效的方法，直接消除预训练模型中的噪声影响，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过概率视角生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念的同时误导分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击局限于单张图像的扰动，缺乏多样性和概念保持能力。

Method: 利用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗样本。

Result: 生成的对抗样本更具多样性，有效保持原始概念，攻击效率更高。

Conclusion: 概念对抗攻击框架在理论和实证上均优于传统方法。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Motivation: 农业作物类型信息的准确性和及时性对国家粮食安全、农业政策制定和经济规划至关重要，特别是在印度这样的农业大国。现有方法在可扩展性、作物覆盖范围及季节内识别方面存在不足。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星图像与全国农场边界数据，采用深度学习模型，并引入自动季节检测算法，估计作物播种和收获期。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了高度可扩展性和有效性，为印度农业监测和管理提供了可操作的数据驱动见解。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Conclusion: DOCTOR模型通过多模态一致性学习和特征增强，显著提升了领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Motivation: 探索AI在重现或重新想象神圣叙事中的作用，以及其潜在的创造性和局限性。

Method: 使用MidJourney生成图像，并通过比较视觉分析（包括Google图像和古典绘画）评估AI生成图像的风格、神学和文化的表现。

Result: AI能生成美学丰富的图像，但也反映训练数据的偏见和局限性；其创造性和神学深度存疑。

Conclusion: AI可作为圣经文本重新诠释的创意伙伴，但在神圣艺术中的角色仍具争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Motivation: 墓碑作为历史和文化的重要载体，面临物理侵蚀、环境退化等保护挑战，亟需数字化解决方案。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型将墓碑图像转化为结构化墓碑意义表示（TMRs），并结合检索增强生成（RAG）整合外部依赖元素。

Result: 解析准确率从传统OCR的F1分数36.1提升至89.5，并在多语言和文化背景下验证了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次利用大规模视觉语言模型形式化墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型（VLMs）在空间变形推理任务中的表现，发现现有模型在此类任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类具有自然的空间推理能力，而当前视觉语言模型是否具备类似能力尚不明确，因此需要评估其空间变形推理能力。

Method: 构建了一个从2D到3D的空间变形推理基准，通过数据引擎生成无限的问题对，并采用阶梯式竞赛形式评估模型的正向和逆向推理能力。

Result: 几乎所有模型在空间变形推理任务中表现不佳，即使经过针对性训练和主流推理增强方法，仍无法有效处理3D空间变形推理。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在空间变形推理任务中存在显著不足，未来研究需进一步改进模型能力。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

Method: 提出IMET框架，结合课程学习和核心集选择，通过迭代识别误分类样本优化训练，重点关注边缘案例和罕见结果。

Result: 在医学图像分类基准数据集上，IMET表现优于现有ResNet架构，提高了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: IMET框架在医学图像分析中展现出潜力，能有效提升模型性能，尤其适用于处理噪声数据和边缘案例。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在深度融合与计算可扩展性之间存在矛盾，现有跨注意力模型虽性能强但计算复杂度高。

Method: GRF采用循环处理模态，通过Transformer Decoder层进行对称跨注意力，并利用Gated Fusion Unit动态控制信息流。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中表现优异，线性复杂度使其适用于高模态环境。

Conclusion: GRF为强大且可扩展的多模态表示学习提供了高效范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了TSG任务中的虚假相关问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息而忽视视觉输入的问题。

Method: 通过分析MLLM注意力模式，提出Look-Back方法，引导模型自主决定何时、何地及如何重新关注视觉输入。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型在多模态基准测试中的推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备自发视觉融合推理能力，Look-Back方法有效且无需额外输入或结构约束。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue
in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our
standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy
and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time
digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative
method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology,
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology
(SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time
microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images
of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic
analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review
the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific
and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of
intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including
neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and
periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI
foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical

Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that
can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.

Result: LATTE在GenImage和DiffusionFake等基准测试中优于基线方法，并在跨生成器和跨数据集场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: LATTE展示了潜在嵌入轨迹在生成图像检测中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLMs的幻觉提供了新视角，并强调了将心理学原则整合到模型评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在高风险应用中具有优势，但在大气科学中尚未广泛应用。目标是开发可解释、基于物理的机器学习算法，并简化OT检测过程。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），应用EBM进行分类任务，并结合领域专家的策略调整模型。

Result: 最终模型虽未达到复杂方法的精度，但表现良好，为可解释机器学习在大气科学中的应用迈出重要一步。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程和领域知识，为气象应用提供了一种可解释的机器学习方法。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升番茄病害识别，有望提高作物产量和粮食安全。

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Result: 仿真和真实视频数据验证了方法的有效性，表明无论特征点位置如何，旋转速率计算一致。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于物体形状和场景知识，适用于并行处理和场景分割。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法如对比学习在人类活动识别中具有吸引力，但主体间的领域偏移导致模型泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)损失函数，通过重新加权来自同一主体的负样本对，抑制主体特异性特征。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%，并展示了其在多种设置下的适应性。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，显著提升了人类活动识别模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR有效解决了双频PolSAR图像分类中的关键问题，实现了更好的分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on

TL;DR: 论文提出ConceptMix++框架，通过迭代优化提示词，分离提示词表达与图像生成能力，揭示现有评测方法低估模型性能的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像（T2I）评测方法因提示词敏感性导致模型生成能力被低估，且存在偏见。

Method: 基于ConceptMix，引入多模态优化流程，利用视觉语言模型反馈系统性优化提示词。

Result: 优化后的提示词显著提升生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，并发现某些视觉概念（如空间关系和形状）优化效果更明显。

Conclusion: 现有评测方法低估模型能力，而ConceptMix++提供更准确的评估和未来开发方向。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调即可实现选择性遗忘的视觉Transformer架构{\pname}，通过在训练过程中模拟遗忘，避免了性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法依赖微调，成本高且可能导致性能下降，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 在训练过程中随机将小批量数据分为遗忘集和保留集，优化模型使其无法预测遗忘集，通过撤销密钥实现即时遗忘。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上验证了{\pname}的优越性，优于基于微调和无微调的方法。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效、无需微调的机器遗忘解决方案，避免了性能损失。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Conclusion: MolVision展示了视觉信息在分子属性预测中的潜力，多模态融合和高效微调策略是关键。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Conclusion: 该方法在无需姿态标注的情况下实现了高精度对齐，并具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Motivation: 胃肠道恶性肿瘤预后差，内镜黏膜下剥离术（ESD）的计算机辅助系统在复杂工作流中阶段识别存在瓶颈。

Method: 提出CPKD框架，通过去噪扩散逐步重建阶段序列，结合条件掩码策略和临床先验知识优化模型。

Result: 在ESD820、Cholec80及多中心数据集上表现优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: 扩散生成范式在手术阶段识别中有效，CPKD框架具有潜力。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Motivation: 现有研究在基准数据集上表现良好，但未探索利用大量未标记OOD图像的潜力，这些图像在现实场景中常见但分布不同，可能导致伪标签不准确。

Method: 提出SemiOVS框架，结合开放词汇分割模型（OVS）为OOD图像生成伪标签，优化半监督学习。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和Context数据集上，SemiOVS比PrevMatch和SemiVL分别提升3.5和3.0 mIoU，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SemiOVS有效利用未标记OOD图像，为半监督语义分割提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域泛化（DG）方法主要针对单模态数据，无法直接适用于多模态场景，导致泛化效果不佳。论文旨在解决多模态领域泛化的挑战。

Method: 提出统一表示方法将多模态数据映射到同一空间，并引入监督解耦框架分离模态通用和模态特定信息。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Human-Animal-Cartoon等基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态领域泛化的性能，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Motivation: 多相机系统在自动驾驶和机器人环境感知中日益重要，但传统全局SfM系统因优化框架问题缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 采用解耦的旋转平均模块和混合平移平均模块，通过分层策略估计旋转，并结合相机间和相机到点的约束优化平移。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在精度上匹配或超过增量SfM，同时显著提升效率，优于现有全局SfM方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多相机SfM应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

Motivation: 将文本定义的作者写作风格转化为视觉表示是一个新颖的挑战，旨在探索生成AI在跨模态理解中的应用。

Method: 使用作者写作摘要（AWS）作为输入，通过大型语言模型（Claude 3.7 Sonnet）生成文本提示，再用扩散模型（Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium）生成图像。

Result: 人类评估显示生成的图像与作者风格匹配度较高（平均4.08/5），且视觉区分度适中。定性分析表明能捕捉情绪和氛围，但对抽象叙事元素的表示仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为视觉化作者风格提供了一种端到端方法，并初步验证了其有效性，为创意辅助和跨模态理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Motivation: 现实场景中隐私问题限制了敏感数据的访问，SFUDA无需目标域标记数据即可进行域适应，但存在原型样本质量低和伪标签分配错误的问题。

Method: 方法分为三阶段：1) 可靠样本记忆模块提升原型质量；2) 多视图对比学习增强伪标签质量；3) 噪声标签过滤进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种先进方法平均提升了约2%和6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键挑战，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in

design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，且动态卷积仅关注空间建模，忽略时间动态和上下文依赖。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升CSLR的泛化能力和准确性，且SR-CTC可无缝集成现有模型。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了高效且准确的解决方案，新数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，显著提升了动作序列的连贯性和任务对齐性。

Conclusion: MTID模型通过改进的监督和任务适应性机制，有效提升了动作序列规划的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Motivation: 现有两阶段编辑流程（掩码生成+扩散编辑）过于关注生成器优化，忽视了掩码可控性，导致用户定义灵活性和姿态鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出Pose-Star框架，动态重组身体结构为解剖感知掩码，通过骨骼关键点校准注意力（Star tokens），结合相位感知分析和Canny对齐优化掩码。

Conclusion: 该工作为工业时尚图像编辑提供了解剖感知、姿态鲁棒的解决方案，填补了可控基准与开放世界需求之间的空白。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Motivation: 现有防御方法无法应对未知攻击，导致对抗鲁棒性的泛化问题。论文旨在通过揭示对抗样本中普遍存在的低熵先验（LE）特性，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出REAL方法，包括两阶段修正：1）通过反向最大化预测熵消除对抗性；2）通过正向最小化预测熵确保正确分类。同时引入攻击感知权重机制。

Result: 实验表明，REAL显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: LE先验为对抗样本防御提供了通用性指导，REAL方法在多种数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their
surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for
reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过多裁剪增强激活CLIP局部特征分析能力的方法，解决了其偏向全局图像模式的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽视了细粒度局部语义，而现有方法假设VLMs能识别局部细节，但实验表明CLIP对全局模式的偏向限制了其处理局部描述符的能力。

Method: 采用随机多裁剪增强技术，通过裁剪局部区域约束模型的感受野并重新校准其注意力机制，从而缓解其固有偏向。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够显著提升CLIP在局部特征分析上的能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Result: 方法在RadarScenes数据集上表现优于现有技术，且运行速度快于传感器帧率。

Conclusion: 单次雷达扫描即可实现高精度移动物体分割，为自动驾驶提供了高效的感知方案。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上，BiCD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BiCD为基于BNN的变化检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架在细粒度视频分类任务中表现出色，跨模态注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models

evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，循环学习显著提升了无监督动作分割的效果。

Conclusion: CLOT通过多级循环学习机制，有效解决了ASOT的局限性，提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑卒中是全球死亡和长期残疾的主要原因之一，现有诊断方法依赖单切片预测和人工选择关键CT切片，机器学习为改进诊断提供了新途径。

Method: 使用预训练模型（如DenseNet201、MobileNetV2等）进行特征提取，结合BFO、PCA和LDA等特征工程技术优化性能，并采用多种机器学习算法（如SVC、RF等）进行分类。

Result: MobileNetV2、LDA和SVC的组合实现了97.93%的最高分类准确率，显著优于其他组合。

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练模型结合优化和分类技术对脑卒中诊断有效。

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

TL;DR: 提出并验证了一种基于纹理的图像指标，用于预测路面摩擦系数，该方法成本低且易于操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路面抗滑性对道路安全至关重要，需要一种低成本且易于测量的方法来评估路面摩擦。

Method: 通过数字图像测量路面纹理，提出集料突出面积作为指标，并与动态摩擦测试仪（DFT）测量的摩擦系数建立统计模型。

Result: 所有模型的调整R平方值均超过0.90，表明该指标能准确反映路面摩擦随抛光周期的变化。

Conclusion: 该图像指标在混合料设计阶段具有成本效益，能有效预测路面摩擦性能。

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种2.5D目标检测框架，专门用于路边基础设施摄像头，通过检测车辆地面的平行四边形来解决传统3D检测在俯视角下的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的传感器可能被遮挡或视野受限，路边基础设施感知系统可以提供补充信息流，但传统3D检测算法在俯视角下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用2.5D目标检测框架，检测车辆地面的平行四边形，保留平面位置、大小和方向，忽略高度。训练结合真实和合成场景数据。

Result: 在未见过的视角和恶劣天气条件下表现出高检测精度、强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了有效的补充感知方案，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Conclusion: 结论强调了开发通用性模型在高影响力科学应用中的机会，并发布了代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

TL;DR: Causal-SAM-LLM框架通过语言对抗解耦和测试时因果干预，提升医学图像分割模型的泛化能力，显著改进OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学图像分割中因学习虚假相关性而无法泛化到未见域的问题。

Method: 结合语言对抗解耦（LAD）和测试时因果干预（TCI），利用LLM作为因果推理器，优化SAM编码器。

Result: 在跨扫描器、跨模态和跨解剖学设置中，平均Dice分数提升6.2分，Hausdorff距离减少15.8毫米。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据少、高维度和缺乏可扩展模型的问题，现有自监督学习方法未能同时捕捉时空特征。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，利用V-JEPA框架学习时空表示，结合联合嵌入和自适应掩码。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: ProtoMM是一种无需训练的多模态原型框架，通过结合文本和视觉特征提升预训练视觉语言模型的测试时适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注文本模态的原型学习，忽略了类名的模糊语义，导致原型无法充分捕捉视觉概念，性能受限。

Method: ProtoMM构建多模态原型，将原型视为文本描述和视觉粒子的离散分布，动态更新视觉粒子，并通过最优传输问题量化原型与测试图像的语义距离。

Result: 在15个零样本基准测试中，ProtoMM平均准确率提升1.03%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型动态学习，显著提升了视觉语言模型在测试时的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

Motivation: 探究视觉嵌入模型是否能够通过线性方向捕捉连续有序属性，并验证其在实际应用中的潜力。

Method: 通过7种流行编码器和9个数据集（涵盖年龄、人群计数、头部姿态等属性），定义“可排名”模型，并测试其性能。

Result: 发现许多嵌入模型天生具备可排名性，且仅需少量样本（甚至两个极端示例）即可恢复有意义的排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究结果为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供了新思路，并推动对可排名嵌入结构和学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SAMed-2在医学图像分割任务中表现出色，解决了噪声和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

Conclusion: LLMs在手语识别中具有显著潜力，无需微调即可提升性能。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Conclusion: 该系统适合工业和住宅安全领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Motivation: 现有3DGS SLAM方法在户外场景中缺乏几何先验或存在尺度漂移问题，S3PO-GS旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出自一致的跟踪模块和基于块的动态映射模块，结合3D高斯点云，避免尺度漂移并引入几何先验。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在新型视图合成和跟踪精度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS显著提升了户外3DGS SLAM的鲁棒性和精度，适用于复杂户外环境。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMs在少步生成中效率高，但训练不稳定，原因是模型仅学习概率流的捷径而忽略了瞬时速度场。

Method: 引入FACM，使用Flow Matching任务作为锚定，无需架构修改，兼容标准模型。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FACM以两步（NFE=2）达到FID 1.32，一步（NFE=1）达到1.76，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACM为高性能少步生成模型提供了一种通用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building
high-performance, few-step generative models. Our code and pretrained models:

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型通常仅能离线生成短片段，限制了交互和实时应用的需求。

Method: StreamDiT基于adaLN DiT，采用流匹配训练和移动缓冲区，结合多步蒸馏方法优化性能。

Result: 蒸馏后的模型在单GPU上实现16 FPS的实时性能，生成512p分辨率视频流。

Conclusion: StreamDiT支持实时视频生成，适用于流媒体、交互式生成等应用。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

*Hebei Li,Yansong Peng,Jiahui Yuan,Peixi Wu,Jin Wang,Yueyi Zhang,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效混合框架，结合事件和帧数据用于图像语义分割，通过三个模块优化信息融合，显著提升准确性和降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用事件和帧数据的互补信息，导致训练复杂且计算成本高。

Method: 采用双分支结构（SNN和ANN），引入ATW Injector、EDS Injector和CSF模块优化特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优准确率，能耗降低65%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合事件和帧数据，显著提升语义分割性能并降低能耗。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DINOv2预训练策略，通过频率过滤课程和高斯噪声补丁增强，显著加速收敛并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要高计算资源，难以在私有数据或新模态上复现，因此需要更高效的预训练方法。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强技术。

Result: 在ViT-B/16上，预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性，线性探测性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着ViT在安全关键应用中的普及，确保其在内存位翻转故障下的正确功能变得至关重要。

Result: 该方法显著提升了ViT模型对位翻转的鲁棒性，可靠性提高了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该技术为零开销的容错解决方案，适用于安全关键应用中的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有VPR方法通常在单一数据集上训练，导致泛化能力受限；多数据集联合训练可能因数据集差异导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA)，利用学习的查询作为参考码本，通过跨查询相似性生成鲁棒描述符。

Result: QAA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了泛化与峰值性能的平衡。

Conclusion: QAA是一种高效的特征聚合方法，适用于多数据集场景，代码将开源。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以准确反映提示中的所有语义信息，且缺乏自动检测机制。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像质量的同时，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Result: 在多个自动驾驶数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: ArmGS方法显著提升了动态场景建模的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有去雾方法主要关注短距离场景，长距离雾霾去除研究不足，且多模态融合方法常忽略可见光图像中的雾霾残留。

Method: HSVF框架包含语义流和视觉流，前者通过模态不变语义预测恢复无雾场景，后者融合近红外模态的结构细节。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在真实长距离雾霾去除任务中优于现有方法，生成高对比度和丰富纹理的结果。

Conclusion: HSVF通过语义和视觉层次融合，有效解决了长距离雾霾去除问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Result: 在多个公开HAR基准测试中，该方法显著优于11种现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨域活动识别中表现出高效性、有效性和普适性。

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Conclusion: DUS-Net通过保留几何结构和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了3D异常检测的性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型（LLMs）在放射学报告生成中更注重语言流畅性而非临床有效性，且难以捕捉图像与文本的关系。

Method: OTDRG利用最优传输（OT）对齐图像特征与报告中的疾病标签，并通过微调整合图像和文本特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成和临床效能指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG框架在生成语言流畅且临床准确的报告方面表现优异。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and

for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态捕捉交互关系的新方法ASEA，通过自适应节点选择和外部注意力模块，显著提升了交互建模的灵活性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN方法将交互个体视为独立图，忽略了其内在依赖关系；预定义交互矩阵无法动态捕捉上下文相关的联合交互。

Method: 结合GCN建模个体内部关系，引入AT-NAC模块自适应选择节点，EA模块建模交互动态与语义关系。

Result: 实验表明，ASEA在交互关系建模上更灵活有效，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ASEA通过动态节点选择和外部注意力机制，显著提升了交互建模的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于毫米波雷达的场景流估计框架，利用视觉-惯性（VI）传感器数据进行监督训练，解决了传统方法依赖昂贵LiDAR数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前毫米波雷达场景流估计方法依赖昂贵的3D LiDAR数据，而VI数据虽普及但无法直接监督3D运动。此外，VI的刚性变换时间漂移影响静态点场景流估计。

Method: 提出无漂移刚性变换估计器，融合运动学模型与神经网络结果，并开发光学-毫米波监督提取模块，结合光学与雷达测量约束动态点场景流。

Result: 实验表明，在烟雾环境中，该方法性能优于依赖昂贵LiDAR的现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过低成本VI数据实现高效场景流估计，适用于智能车辆等场景。

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Conclusion: RoSe通过光照过渡场和低秩约束，实现了高效的低光场景恢复和多视角一致性。

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂道路环境中OOD检测的可靠性问题，特别是在密集重叠物体、远距离小物体和大前景物体等挑战性场景中。

Method: 利用GPT-4等基础模型的知识和推理能力，通过改进的图像理解和基于提示的推理来增强OOD检测。

Result: 在标准基准和新定义的RoadAnomaly数据集子集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂驾驶环境中的OOD语义分割提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BEV语义分割中标记数据分布单一的问题，利用合成数据增强多样性，但生成噪声影响学习效果。

Method: 提出PGCM评估生成数据质量，BiDPP增强模型鲁棒性，HLSE解决非互斥性问题。

Result: NRSeg在无监督和半监督BEV分割任务中mIoU分别提升13.8%和11.4%。

Conclusion: NRSeg通过噪声鲁棒设计和模块优化，显著提升了BEV语义分割性能。

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DGFAS框架，通过特征正交分解（FOD）和组尺度风险最小化（GS-RM）联合对齐权重和偏置，解决了现有方法中偏置项未对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法虽能对齐局部决策边界的权重，但偏置项未对齐导致分类阈值不一致，影响性能。

Method: 使用FOD显式分解特征空间为域不变和域特定子空间，并通过GS-RM平衡多域组损失以对齐偏置。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现最优性能，提高准确性、减少偏置未对齐，并增强对未见目标域的泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了偏置未对齐问题，显著提升了DGFAS的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

Motivation: 传统生境评估依赖专家调查，成本高且效率低。AI驱动的工具可自动化这一过程，但现有方法多依赖遥感数据，受限于传感器和分辨率。地面图像能捕捉更多细节，但相关研究较少。

Method: 使用英国Countryside Survey数据，涵盖18种生境类型。评估CNN和ViT模型，结合监督和监督对比学习范式。

Result: ViT在分类指标上优于CNN（Top-3准确率91%，MCC=0.66），监督对比学习显著减少相似生境的误分类。模型性能接近专家水平。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态学，研究为地面生境监测提供了可扩展、经济高效的框架，有助于生物多样性保护和土地利用决策。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

Motivation: 持续学习（CL）中灾难性遗忘问题严重，尤其在ViTs中使用MLPs时，新信息会覆盖旧知识。

Method: 用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）替代ViTs中的MLPs，利用基于样条的激活实现局部可塑性，仅更新部分参数。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒和适应性模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical

this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MTU3D比现有方法提升了14%到23%的成功率。

Conclusion: MTU3D通过结合视觉定位与探索，为具身智能提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and
exploration for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散的框架DiffGRE，用于动态类别发现（OCD），通过生成、精炼和编码多阶段方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCD方法仅依赖标注数据，知识迁移能力有限，尤其在细粒度识别中标注数据不足时表现不佳。

Method: 提出DiffGRE框架，包括基于扩散的样本生成、多样性驱动的精炼和半监督编码，以增强模型对已知和未知类别的发现能力。

Result: 在六个细粒度数据集上的实验表明，DiffGRE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过多阶段方法有效提升了动态类别发现的性能，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCL的多阶段训练框架，通过Prior Compensation Factor（PCF）补偿丢失的先验信息，解决了HMP中短长期预测不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HMP中因平等对待不同时刻预测而导致的两个主要限制：短时预测学习受长时预测影响，以及先验信息利用不足。

Method: 引入TCL框架和PCF，理论推导优化目标，并与不同HMP主干模型结合。

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上验证了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能有效解决HMP中的问题，且易于集成和适应不同场景。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决动作驱动随机人体运动预测中过渡不平滑和动作特征难以学习的问题。

Method: 提出Soft-transition Action Bank (STAB)和Action Characteristic Bank (ACB)两个记忆库，结合Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA)策略。

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAB和ACB结合AAA策略有效解决了目标问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中通常提供的是有限视场的街景图像，而非全景图像，因此需要探索更实用的地理定位方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先检索候选卫星图像嵌入，然后通过重排序阶段选择性提升检索精度。

Result: 实验结果显示，R@1和R@10检索率分别达到topone%和topten%，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 优化检索和重排序策略在提升实际地理定位性能方面具有潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在复杂环境和动态场景中多目标跟踪的挑战，如轨迹中断和参数动态调整。

Method: 结合高斯过程作为运动模型和非齐次泊松过程作为观测模型，引入粒子滤波推理方案，支持轨迹管理和超参数学习。GaPP-ReaCtion进一步通过MCMC核实现轨迹恢复。

Result: 在合成和真实数据测试中，GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion优于现有算法，GaPP-ReaCtion显著减少轨迹中断（如真实雷达数据减少30%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景下表现优异，尤其GaPP-ReaCtion通过轨迹恢复机制进一步提升了跟踪鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

TL;DR: PromptSR提出了一种轻量级图像超分辨率方法，通过级联提示块（CPB）结合全局和局部信息，解决了窗口自注意力模型接收域受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级Vision Transformer在图像超分辨率中面临接收域受限和计算复杂度高的问题，PromptSR旨在通过提示机制解决这些问题。

Method: 使用级联提示块（CPB），包括全局锚点提示层（GAPL）和两个局部提示层（LPLs），结合跨尺度注意力和自注意力机制，实现全局与局部信息的融合。

Result: 实验表明，PromptSR在定量、定性和复杂度评估上优于现有轻量级超分辨率方法。

Conclusion: PromptSR通过CPB有效扩大了接收域并保持低计算成本，为轻量级图像超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/wenyang001/PromptSR.

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative
Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles
(AVs) that simultaneously achieves low-latency and high-accuracy 3D object
detection. Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware
MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively
fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths
of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal
representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a
end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline
methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes
dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object
detection tasks for AVs.

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an
accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces
Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to
estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver
monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures
synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture
through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving
Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver
readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing
approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion.
As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to
the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with
new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据集，且难以精确控制细粒度视觉属性和空间关系。Hi-SSLVLM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1) 多粒度视觉-语言对齐，自动生成层次化标题；2) 自优化和引导图像生成，结合ICP机制和语义一致性损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于主流模型，如Janus-Pro-1B和Stable Diffusion XL 1.0，并在人类评估中表现更优。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM在可控性和语义一致性方面取得显著进展，为开放文本到图像生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成具有一致运动的无界场景，并可通过场景提示控制生成内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager通过射线上下文和点云更新，有效解决了单视图动态场景生成的3D一致性问题。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

Result: 动态范围扩展了一个数量级，信噪比显著提升，数字合并优于模拟合并。

Conclusion: 空间变化的增益和合并技术有效提升图像质量，适用于高动态范围成像等应用。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Result: 实验证明方法在多个区域（如头发、眼睛等）表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高质量、语义对齐的肖像风格迁移，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室小鼠在生物医学研究中至关重要，但复杂的非刚性形变和无纹理外观使得3D表面运动重建具有挑战性，且缺乏结构化3D数据集限制了进展。

Method: 1. 构建首个高保真密集视角合成数据集；2. 采用基于变换器的前馈架构与三平面表示；3. 创建基于测地线的连续对应嵌入。

Conclusion: MoReMouse为小鼠3D重建提供了高效解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化神经网络训练中的数据管理，减少冗余计算，提升训练效率和模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出GSTDS算法，基于预训练模型和Fiedler向量评分机制动态筛选数据，减少每批次处理的数据量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低至四分之一，性能不降反升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 谱基数据选择为高效深度学习提供了可扩展方案，未来可进一步探索自适应数据管理策略。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Result: 在LOL数据集上PSNR达19.04 dB，参数仅0.07%，在移动设备上实现30 FPS的4K图像处理。

Conclusion: LiteIE是资源受限平台上高效实用的低光增强解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates
dependence on large-scale supervision and generalizes well across diverse
conditions. We design a backbone-agnostic feature extractor with only two
convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

<details>

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端框架和视频模型先验，显著提升了3D纹理生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Motivation: 现有视频理解基准局限于英语且缺乏深度推理能力，无法满足医学教育等专业领域的需求。

Method: 提出M3-Med基准，包含医学问题与视频片段配对，设计多跳推理任务，要求模型跨模态整合信息。

Result: 评估显示现有模型与人类专家在复杂多跳问题上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI在专业领域深度跨模态推理的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2通过改进的量化设计和优化策略，有效解决了极低比特量化下的性能问题，为边缘设备上的扩散模型应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Method: 提出LEAwareSGD，利用LE测量动态调整学习率，使模型在混沌边缘训练，平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上的实验显示，LEAwareSGD在低数据情况下性能提升高达9.47%。

Conclusion: 训练在混沌边缘能有效提升SDG任务的泛化能力，LEAwareSGD方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Result: DLCN数据集提供了高多样性和真实性，为评估算法鲁棒性提供了宝贵资源。

Conclusion: DLCN数据集和Happy-rPPG工具包的发布促进了复杂条件下rPPG算法的研究。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The
dataset and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 大气湍流导致监控图像质量下降，影响目标分类和场景跟踪，现有深度学习方法在时空扭曲下表现不佳。

Result: DMAT在生成湍流的数据集上比现有方法性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT有效解决了AT下的图像质量和目标检测问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

Motivation: 现有医学VQA方法通常独立提取图像和文本特征，忽略了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间相关性，导致回答碎片化且不精确。

Method: 构建跨模态图，将CT切片和问题标记作为节点，利用注意力图卷积网络动态融合信息，生成软提示以指导LLM生成答案。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过图表示和LLM的结合，显著提升了医学VQA的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

### [145] [Transferring Visual Explainability of Self-Explaining Models through Task Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04380)
*Yuya Yoshikawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于任务算术框架的方法，将自解释模型的视觉可解释性从源域迁移到目标域，提升目标域的解释质量且不影响分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自解释模型在图像分类中高效，但训练成本高，本研究旨在降低这一成本。

Method: 扩展基于视觉语言预训练模型的图像分类器，定义可解释性向量，并通过任务算术框架迁移到目标域。

Result: 实验表明，除部分不相关域外，可解释性成功迁移，且解释质量与Kernel SHAP相当。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，显著降低训练成本并提升解释质量。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注特定层的信息，忽略了决策过程中跨层分布的证据，导致信息压缩过度。

Method: 在多目标层应用信息瓶颈，共享参数化阻尼比，通过变分方法上界层间信息，确保丢弃的激活对决策不必要。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoIBA显著提高了特征归因的忠实性。

Conclusion: CoIBA通过跨层共享信息，有效补充了决策过程中遗漏的线索，提升了归因的全面性和准确性。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态遥感图像配准面临非线性辐射变化和纹理限制的挑战，现有方法（如CNNs和Transformers）存在局部感受野或高计算复杂度的问题。

Method: 采用多方向交叉扫描策略捕获全局上下文关系，结合多专家特征学习（MEFL）策略动态融合特征，并通过多级特征聚合（MFA）模块提取局部信息。

Result: 在多种分辨率的CRSI上实验表明，RegistrationMamba优于现有方法，具有更高的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过结合全局和局部特征提取，显著提升了跨模态遥感图像配准的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在合成数据集上验证，Sat2City从单张卫星图像生成高保真3D结构，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Sat2City通过创新方法解决了3D城市生成的挑战，为游戏和数字孪生等应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计方法需要昂贵的3D监督且泛化能力有限，尤其在户外无界场景中表现不佳。

Method: 利用视图一致性分布替代固定深度值，结合颜色特征和基础模型的高层特征，并引入深度推动损失进行联合正则化。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在新视角合成上优于现有NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过视图一致性分布和深度推动损失，有效提升了NeRF在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、训练样本有限和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力不足。

Result: 在IN、UP和KSC数据集上，MVNet在分类精度和计算效率上优于主流方法。

Conclusion: MVNet展示了处理复杂高光谱数据的强大能力，为高光谱图像分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食品类别，缺乏全面的大型食品基准，且许多食品属性（如甜度、重量）难以通过RGB相机准确感知。

Method: 通过整合现有食品数据集并收集数百种食品的高光谱图像，结合仪器实验测定食品属性，构建了包含3,266个食品类别和2,351k数据点的基准。

Result: 大规模模型在数字化食品方面表现不佳，食品成为最难研究的对象之一；光谱数据对分析食品属性（如甜度）至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，以支持不同食品分析任务的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

Conclusion: DreamVLA通过整合全面世界知识和解耦表示，显著提升了机器人操作的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以实现输入文本的空间对齐，布局规划与生成过程脱节导致优化困难。

Method: CoT-Diff在扩散过程中集成MLLM驱动的3D布局规划，通过动态更新布局并转换为语义条件和深度图，利用条件感知注意力机制指导生成。

Result: 在3D场景基准测试中，CoT-Diff显著提升了空间对齐和组合保真度，复杂场景空间准确率比现有方法高34.7%。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff通过紧密耦合的生成范式，验证了其在提升空间控制和语义注入方面的有效性。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

Method: 提出BiVM，包括弹性快捷方式的二值化编码器、稀疏化解码器特征及局部二值化感知模仿框架。

Result: BiVM在计算和存储成本上分别节省14.3倍和21.6倍，性能优于现有二值化方法。

Conclusion: BiVM通过优化信息流和计算效率，显著提升了二值化视频抠图的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的情况下实现了高效的风格和内容控制，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVL-Loc是一个新颖的端到端多场景6-DoF相机重定位框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）的预训练知识，结合多模态数据和自然语言指导，提升在复杂场景中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的相机重定位方法在单一场景中回归相机姿态，缺乏在多样化环境中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: MVL-Loc利用预训练的视觉语言模型知识，结合多模态数据和自然语言指导，实现跨室内外场景的泛化。

Result: 在7Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上的实验表明，MVL-Loc在多场景相机重定位中表现出鲁棒性和最先进的性能，位置和方向估计的准确性均有所提升。

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过结合视觉语言模型和多模态数据，显著提升了相机重定位的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

*Xinhua Lu,Runhe Lai,Yanqi Wu,Kanghao Chen,Wei-Shi Zheng,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的框架FA，通过强制提示学习（FA）充分利用ID知识提升OOD检测效果，无需外部数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法在OOD检测中泛化能力有限或依赖外部数据集，FA旨在通过ID知识提升效果。

Method: 学习包含更丰富ID类描述的强制提示，通过强制系数增强语义相似性。

Result: FA在OOD检测中表现显著优于现有方法，无需外部数据且参数数量与CoOp相同。

Conclusion: FA通过ID知识优化OOD检测，效果显著且无需额外资源。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

*Anna Deichler,Jim O'Regan,Teo Guichoux,David Johansson,Jonas Beskow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合空间基础和上下文感知的手势生成框架，填补了现有模型在环境基础和手势生成之间的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常专注于描述性运动生成或孤立的手势合成，缺乏对空间基础和上下文感知的结合，限制了具身交互代理的发展。

Method: 作者引入了一个多模态数据集和框架，结合了合成数据集和VR对话数据集，提供了同步的运动、语音和3D场景信息，并连接到物理模拟器进行数据生成和评估。

Result: 该框架提供了7.7小时的标准化数据，为空间基础手势生成提供了资源。

Conclusion: 通过结合手势建模和空间基础，本文为具身手势生成和多模态交互研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据收集偏向常见场景和对象，导致新颖事件代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性分数，识别并丢弃冗余帧，保留新颖对象。

Result: 减少训练数据集大小可提升模型性能，而数据冗余增加时，更激进的过滤方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时部署，通过持续更新正常内容的定义，高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive
generative modeling due to the high dimensionality of video data. This work
introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

TL;DR: S$^2$Edit是一种基于预训练扩散模型的新方法，通过可学习文本令牌嵌入身份信息，实现个性化编辑，同时保持身份细节和高频信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在需要细粒度控制的编辑任务中（如人脸编辑）表现不佳，导致身份信息丢失或无关区域被修改。

Method: 通过正交约束在文本特征空间中解耦身份令牌与待编辑属性，并使用对象掩码引导交叉注意力图。

Result: S$^2$Edit在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，并能实现局部编辑和身份保留。

Conclusion: S$^2$Edit在图像编辑任务中表现出色，支持多种应用如化妆迁移。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣天气下表现稳健，但其稀疏点和噪声测量限制了性能提升，现有研究未充分探索雷达和融合机制的潜力。

Method: 设计了两阶段融合网络：第一阶段通过雷达引导的迭代BEV融合模块生成高召回率的3D提案框；第二阶段聚合多视图特征以优化提案。

Result: 在公开数据集上显著优于现有方法，在VoD和TJ4DRadSet上分别提升了9.10%和3.68%的mAP。

Conclusion: CVFusion通过跨视图融合和多阶段优化，显著提升了4D雷达的3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态嵌入模型（如VLM2Vec、E5-V、GME）主要针对自然图像，对其他视觉形式（如视频和视觉文档）支持有限，限制了其在现实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出VLM2Vec-V2框架，并扩展MMEB-V2基准，新增五种任务类型（如视频检索、视觉文档检索等）。训练支持多模态输入的通用嵌入模型。

Result: VLM2Vec-V2在新任务上表现优异，同时在原有图像基准上超越先前模型。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态嵌入模型的通用性和统一学习策略提供了见解，为更可扩展和适应性强的表示学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种基于QR分解的新型微调框架，通过结构化参数更新有效分离视觉属性，减少参数数量并避免特征纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在组合多个LoRA模型时，常因权重矩阵的非结构化修改导致内容与风格属性纠缠。

Method: 利用QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的任务特定ΔR矩阵，实现结构化参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中实现了更好的解耦效果。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效、解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HiLa的分层视觉-语言协作框架，通过多层级视觉特征和语言提示的优化对齐，改进了癌症生存预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的幻灯片级标签，无法从千兆像素的WSIs中学习判别性表示；现有VL方法仅使用简单语言提示和基本余弦相似度，无法捕捉多层面语言信息与视觉特征的细粒度关联。

Method: HiLa框架利用预训练特征提取器生成WSIs的分层视觉特征（补丁和区域级），并通过最优提示学习（OPL）将多属性语言提示与视觉特征对齐；引入跨级传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块以增强层级协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉-语言协作和优化提示学习，显著提升了生存预测的准确性，为WSIs的生存预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Motivation: 3D VQA中自由形式的答案常导致误导性标注，而数据稀缺放大了这一问题，现有主动学习方法无法解决误导性标签。

Method: 采用多轮交互式主动学习策略，基于语义不确定性选择数据并请求重新标注，使用基于方差的度量评估不确定性。

Result: 实验显示模型性能提升，训练成本减半。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了误导性标注问题，显著提升了3D VQA的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: SMoEStereo为立体匹配提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了跨域性能。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Method: 提出LTMSformer框架，包括局部趋势感知注意力机制、运动状态编码器和轻量级轨迹优化模块。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，性能优于基线HiVT-64，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer在减少模型规模的同时，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%

cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性建模有效提升了多模态对象重识别的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的多阶段流程，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。VectorLLM旨在利用大语言模型的推理能力，简化流程并提高性能。

Method: VectorLLM结合视觉基础模型、MLP连接器和LLM，通过可学习的位置嵌入增强空间理解能力，采用预训练、监督微调和偏好优化策略。

Conclusion: VectorLLM为遥感图像中的矢量提取建立了新范式，结合高精度和强泛化能力，推动了社区发展。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

TL;DR: AVATAR提出了一种视频为中心的音频-视觉定位基准，解决了现有方法忽略时间动态和简化场景的问题。TAVLO模型通过高分辨率时间建模实现了更精确的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视觉定位研究仅关注图像级关联，忽略了时间动态，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准，包含四种场景（单声源、混合声源、多实体和屏外声源），并开发了TAVLO模型，整合高分辨率时间信息。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射而难以跟踪时间变化，而TAVLO通过时间建模实现了鲁棒的音频-视觉对齐。

Conclusion: 研究表明时间动态对音频-视觉定位至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频为中心的研究设立了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Conclusion: TeethGenerator为数字化正畸提供了高效的数据生成工具。

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构引导和细节恢复，实现了高质量的肖像阴影去除。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉语言模型的组合推理能力提供了一种高效且数据需求低的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Tempo-R0的视频多模态大语言模型，通过多模态时间感知强化解决时间视频定位任务，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频信息量大且冗余，传统方法难以全面理解视频以准确定位查询相关片段。

Method: 采用自适应性注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳模态对齐（ETA）预处理，并在微调阶段应用部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试集上优于现有方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化有效提升了时间视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

Result: 在0.5 mm严格阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙齿标志点检测提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，本文旨在揭示这一漏洞。

Method: 通过向数据集中注入毒化样本（将微妙触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW输出，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，该方法实现了高攻击成功率，且毒化输入在原始数据中难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源ControlNets管道的严重漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Saliency Benchmark (SalBench) 评估大型视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 在检测人类易察觉的视觉显著特征（如颜色、强度、方向等低层次特征）方面的能力，发现 LVLM 在识别明显视觉异常时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估 LVLM 在视觉显著性任务上的表现，尤其是与人类注意力对齐的能力。

Method: SalBench 包含三种新任务（Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out、Visual Referring Odd-One-Out），用于测试 LVLM 的感知能力。

Result: LVLM 在识别视觉异常时表现较差，即使是先进的 GPT-4o 在简单任务上准确率仅为 47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench 是衡量 LVLM 与人类注意力对齐能力的重要工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

TL;DR: MatDecompSDF是一个从多视角图像中恢复高保真3D形状并分解其基于物理的材料属性的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆向渲染的核心挑战是从2D观测中解耦几何、材料和光照。

Method: 联合优化三个神经组件：神经SDF表示几何、神经场预测PBR材料参数、MLP模型捕捉光照，并通过物理可微分渲染层连接。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成可编辑和可重照的资产。

Conclusion: 方法在几何精度和材料保真度上表现出色，适用于数字内容创建。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种合成PIV基准数据集和MCFormer网络，填补了光学流模型在PIV数据上评估的空白，并显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对光学流模型在PIV数据上的全面评估，阻碍了进展。

Method: 生成合成PIV数据集，并提出MCFormer网络，利用多帧时序信息和多成本体积。

Result: MCFormer显著优于现有方法，达到最低NEPE。

Conclusion: 该工作为PIV研究提供了基准资源和先进方法，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小二乘图的多智能体3D LiDAR场景对抗噪声缓解框架，显著提升了对抗条件下的目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强EdgeAI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）在对抗威胁下的感知能力，通过多智能体合作提升情境理解和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用最小二乘图工具，通过差分坐标和锚点在多智能体对抗边界框上减少检测质心的位置误差，分两阶段进行跟踪以抑制对抗威胁。

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上，该方法比现有单智能体和多智能体跟踪框架性能提升高达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制即可作为对抗威胁的强韧解决方案。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

TL;DR: GraphBrep提出了一种显式表示和学习紧凑拓扑的B-Rep生成模型，通过图扩散模型学习拓扑，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接B-Rep生成在CAD工作流程中日益重要，但现有方法隐式嵌入拓扑导致几何冗余和计算成本高。

Method: 构建无向加权图表示表面拓扑，利用图扩散模型学习拓扑，基于表面特征确定连接性。

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式拓扑表示有效减少冗余，显著提升效率，适用于复杂CAD工作流程。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Result: ArtBulb在定量和定性评估中优于现有模型，并发布了AICD数据集。

Conclusion: 研究旨在弥合法律与技术领域的鸿沟，提升社会对AI艺术版权问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时空事件图的共享表示方法，用于生成视频的长段落描述，并通过自监督神经分析系统验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频描述数据集缺乏长段落自然语言描述，且现有方法难以解释视觉与语言之间的关系。

Method: 提出基于时空事件图的共享表示方法，以可解释的方式生成视频描述，并作为自动教师训练端到端神经网络。

Result: 方法在多个数据集上生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述，并通过标准评估指标和人类注释验证。

Conclusion: 提出的可解释神经分析方法在视频描述生成任务中表现优异，为视觉与语言关系的解释提供了新途径。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致精度下降较大，PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少精度损失。

Method: 采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝），每轮剪枝少量通道，并结合贪心策略选择剪枝层，同时支持迁移学习场景。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP框架通过渐进式剪枝显著减少精度损失，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种下游任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: PointGAC通过聚类中心对齐策略和动态码本更新机制，显著提升了特征学习的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

Motivation: 主流基于姿态的自动化GMA方法因数据质量低和姿态估计噪声导致不确定性高，缺乏可靠的临床应用。

Method: UDF-GMA通过直接建模数据噪声的随机不确定性和贝叶斯近似估计参数的不确定性，并将两者与运动表征融合以增强分类。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效预测poor repertoire，并具有较好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过显式建模不确定性，显著提升了自动化GMA的可靠性和临床适用性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在开放视觉问答中产生的幻觉问题，提升输出的一致性和可靠性。

Result: 实验证明ReLoop有效降低了多个基准测试中的幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一种稳健的解决方案，并计划开源代码和数据。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在持续的幻觉问题，反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性错位。

Method: 论文提出了Hallucination Tri-Space理论，将生成过程描述为在三个关键轴（语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础）上的多轴认知张力场，并开发了TM-ARC控制器来实时干预。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC显著减少了幻觉，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解基于扩散的T2I系统中的生成失败提供了统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph通过模拟人类地图绘制过程，有效解决了复杂车道拓扑建模问题，为自动驾驶提供了更准确的车道结构表示。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 通过'answerability alignment'框架，Video-LLMs在问题相关性评估和拒绝能力上取得显著改进。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment

*Johannes Künzel,Anna Hilsmann,Peter Eisert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIPE是一个基于强化学习的弱监督关键点提取框架，仅需二元标签即可训练，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工变换或3D数据，RIPE通过最小化监督需求，扩展训练数据范围。

Method: 利用编码器中间层和超列方法描述关键点，引入辅助损失提升描述符区分能力。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，简化数据准备。

Conclusion: RIPE在关键点提取和描述方面取得显著进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

*Sourav Ghosh,Chayan Maitra,Rajat K. De*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CMET的新度量方法，用于量化嵌入质量，包括局部和全局形状保留能力，并在多种数据集上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有度量方法在时间和空间复杂度上较高，需要一种更高效的度量方法来比较嵌入与原始数据的局部和全局结构。

Method: 提出CMET度量，包含CMET_L和CMET_G两个分数，分别衡量局部和全局形状保留能力。

Result: CMET在合成、生物和图像数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有低复杂度和稳定性。

Conclusion: CMET是一种高效可靠的度量方法，适用于各种数据类型和规模。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

### [204] [Efficient SAR Vessel Detection for FPGA-Based On-Satellite Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04842)
*Colin Laganier,Liam Fletcher,Elim Kwan,Richard Walters,Victoria Nockles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效且高性能的SAR船舶检测模型，基于定制化的YOLOv8架构，优化用于FPGA处理，满足卫星低功耗需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代卫星生成的数据量增加，传统地面处理延迟高，而现有ML模型体积大、功耗高，难以部署在卫星上。SAR船舶检测是典型的时间敏感任务，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 开发定制化的YOLOv8架构，针对FPGA处理优化，训练和评估基于xView3-SAR数据集，部署在Kria KV260 MPSoC上。

Result: FPGA模型在检测和分类性能上仅比GPU模型低2%和3%，但体积小2-3个数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了小型高性能ML模型在时间敏感SAR分析中的潜力，为自主、响应式的地球观测系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

TL;DR: 通过微调的稳定扩散模型生成合成图像，显著提升了单核白细胞分类器的性能，解决了生物医学数据不平衡和隐私限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据通常存在样本不平衡和隐私限制，阻碍了机器学习模型的开发。合成图像可以改善数据可用性同时保护隐私，但生成高质量合成图像仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用基于LoRA权重的微调稳定扩散模型生成合成图像，并结合少量真实样本指导，训练ResNet和CLIP分类器。

Result: 合成图像显著提升了分类器性能：ResNet准确率从27.3%提升至78.4%，CLIP从61.8%提升至76.8%。

Conclusion: 合成图像是生物医学研究中克服数据限制的有效工具，能提升模型泛化能力，助力医学诊断和研究。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个全页历史文档修复数据集（FPHDR）和自动化修复方法（AutoHDR），通过三阶段工作流显著提升了修复效果和OCR准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档因时间退化严重，现有修复方法无法满足实际需求，需更高效、多模态的解决方案。

Method: AutoHDR采用三阶段方法：OCR辅助损伤定位、视觉-语言上下文文本预测和块自回归外观修复。

Result: AutoHDR将严重损坏文档的OCR准确率从46.83%提升至84.05%，人机协作后达94.25%。

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复方面取得显著进展，为文化遗产保护做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and
dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Conclusion: HGNet在结直肠癌早期检测中表现出色，具有较高的准确性和可解释性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频基准过于关注生成质量和动作识别，缺乏对感知和认知能力的全面评估，且评价指标单一。

Method: 提出HV-MMBench，包含多样化的任务（如年龄估计、意图预测）、多种问题形式（如选择题、填空题）和多领域视频数据。

Result: HV-MMBench支持对MLLM在人类中心视频理解中的全面评估，涵盖15项任务、50种场景和不同时间范围的视频。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench填补了现有基准的不足，为MLLM在人类中心视频理解中的能力提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Result: DINOv2的自监督预训练特征可迁移至航空图像分割，显著减少标注需求。

Conclusion: 自监督特征为航空图像分割提供高效解决方案，减少人工标注负担。

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Result: 模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域虽能改善泛化但不足以克服地理差异，数据对齐等方法可提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究推动了降尺度方法的全球适用性，有助于减少高分辨率气候信息获取的不平等。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click通过交互式设计和对象级特征提取，显著提升了视频到音频生成的精确性和性能。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射编辑方法在多视图编辑中存在局部不一致性，且完全依赖文本提示，导致用户难以灵活控制编辑程度。

Method: 提出CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection策略筛选语义一致的参考视图，构建3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior，并通过Attention Fusion Network融合2D和3D注意力。

Result: 实验表明InterGSEdit在3DGS编辑中实现了最先进的性能，提供了高保真且一致的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式选择和注意力融合，显著提升了3D高斯溅射编辑的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Method: AOR-DR方法将DR分级任务分解为一系列有序步骤，结合前序预测和图像特征，并利用扩散过程建模条件概率，直接使用全局图像特征进行自回归。

Conclusion: AOR-DR通过结合临床知识和扩散过程，显著提升了DR分级的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的扩散模型无法提取时间信息且效率低，而基于视频的扩散模型则因规模和计算成本过高而不实用。

Method: 提出TLB-VFI，结合3D小波门控和时间感知自编码器提取时间信息，并通过光流引导减少训练数据和参数。

Result: 在最具挑战性的数据集上FID提升20%，参数减少3倍，速度提升2.3倍，训练数据需求减少9000倍。

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are

TL;DR: OPAL是一种人类辅助标注方法，通过混合整数线性规划（MILP）最小化标注工作量，同时达到高精度目标，在测试视觉系统中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习（DL）中准确标注数据的稀缺性是一个主要挑战，尤其是在测试阶段需要高精度标注以确保模型验证的可靠性。

Method: OPAL采用MILP公式化方法，最小化标注工作量并满足指定精度目标，适用于测试数据的自动标注和验证。

Result: OPAL在2500多次实验和七个数据集上平均达到98.8%的精度，减少手动标注工作量超过一半，并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: OPAL在保持高精度的同时大幅减少人工标注需求，结合主动学习可进一步优化效率。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升眼科诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

Conclusion: 文本增强的多模态框架显著提升CVS识别性能，展示了通用模型适应专业手术任务的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为手术计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，首次将SPML应用于多手术任务数据整合。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

Conclusion: INTER通过多模态交互信息引导，显著减少LVLMs的幻觉生成，且无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

Motivation: 解决低帧率相机在高速动态场景重建中的局限性，避免直接重建导致的失真问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了高速4D重建质量，等效帧率达100-200 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过异步捕获和生成模型，实现了低成本、高质量的高速4D重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Motivation: 社交媒体在危机事件中是重要信息来源，但如何从海量嘈杂数据中提取有效信息并整合异构数据仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用VLMs（如LLaVA和CLIP）、Guided Cross Attention和Differential Attention机制，结合多模态数据融合策略。

Result: 在CrisisMMD数据集上，模型分类准确率优于现有方法，尤其在多模态特征对齐和任务性能上表现突出。

Conclusion: 预训练VLMs、增强文本描述及自适应融合策略能显著提升危机事件分类的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统帧插值任务局限于少量帧和无文本控制，且缺乏官方定义和基准。本文旨在填补这一空白，支持多帧率和高质量内容生成。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SFI任务、SemFi模型和SFI-300K数据集为帧插值研究提供了新方向和基准。

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

Motivation: 传统遥感方法难以应对碎片化农业景观的时空异质性，因此需要一种适应性强的监测方法。

Method: 采用物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区进行本地化校准，适应农业生态变化。

Conclusion: 研究证明，遥感框架需适应景观复杂性，为区域化农业监测提供了科学且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D场景理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Result: 实验显示CTA在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTA无需专用架构，通过跨任务对齐有效提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低帧率无人机视频中，由于目标外观和位置的快速变化以及图像质量下降，多目标跟踪任务变得复杂且具有挑战性。

Method: 利用单帧注释进行实例关联学习，并结合全局场景特征提供上下文信息，以提高跟踪的鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 该方法在减少输入图像分辨率和潜在表示大小的情况下仍能保持高关联质量，同时提出了一个军事车辆的标注数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下表现出色，为低帧率无人机视频的多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

Result: 实验表明SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持高保真3D生成。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决了CD方法的局限性，实现了高质量的文本到3D生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Result: 在REA数据集上，ST-LLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-LLM通过改进时空理解能力，有效解决了MLLMs在复杂提示上的局限性。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced

preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model

model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Result: 在主流LiDAR基准测试中，LiMA显著提升了语义分割和3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

Method: 将算法表示为操作序列（token），通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和强化学习探索和生成新算法。

Result: 重新发现、改进并生成新算法，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能在计算层面生成针对具体问题实例的算法，而非仅适用于问题类别。

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a
framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences
of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained
using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated
procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement
learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens.
This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as
Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces
algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely
classes.

### [245] [SI-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Feedback-Driven Generation and Tuning of Human-Readable System Instructions for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03223)
*Jeshwanth Challagundla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SI-Agent是一个自动化生成和优化人类可读系统指令的框架，通过反馈循环提升任务性能和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计系统指令资源密集且效果不佳，现有自动化方法牺牲可读性，SI-Agent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SI-Agent采用三个协作代理（指导代理、指令跟随代理和反馈/奖励代理），通过迭代反馈优化指令。

Result: 实验表明SI-Agent在任务性能、可读性和效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SI-Agent在性能和可读性之间取得了平衡，有望推动LLM定制化和透明化，但计算成本和反馈可靠性仍需改进。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且成本高效的GraphRAG框架，通过依赖知识图谱构建和轻量级检索策略，显著降低了计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GraphRAG因高计算成本和延迟而难以在企业环境中部署的问题。

Method: 1. 依赖工业级NLP库构建知识图谱，避免使用LLM；2. 轻量级图检索策略，结合混合查询节点识别和高效单跳遍历。

Result: 在SAP数据集上表现优异，性能提升15%和4.35%，成本显著降低，可扩展性增强。

Conclusion: 验证了GraphRAG在大规模企业应用中的可行性，为实际部署提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: CodeAgents是一个提示框架，通过模块化伪代码改进多代理系统的规划和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化提示策略局限于单代理、仅规划场景，且忽视多代理环境中的效率、模块化和可扩展性。

Method: 将代理交互组件（任务、计划、反馈等）编码为模块化伪代码，包含控制结构和类型变量。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，规划性能提升3-36个百分点，并显著减少令牌使用。

Conclusion: CodeAgents在多代理系统中实现了高效、可解释和可验证的规划，为LLM驱动的代理系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

TL;DR: 论文提出了GDGB基准，用于解决动态文本属性图（DyTAG）生成任务中数据集质量差和缺乏标准化评估的问题，并定义了两个新任务（TDGG和IDGG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DyTAG数据集文本质量差，且缺乏针对生成任务的标准化评估方法，限制了DyTAG生成任务的发展。

Method: 提出GDGB基准，包含8个高质量DyTAG数据集，定义TDGG和IDGG任务，设计多维度评估指标，并开发LLM-based框架GAG-General。

Result: GDGB支持对TDGG和IDGG的严格评估，揭示了结构和文本特征在DyTAG生成中的关键作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为生成性DyTAG研究提供了基础资源，推动了DyTAG生成的实际应用。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Memory Mosaics在更大规模和真实数据集上的表现，并改进其架构。

Method: 将Memory Mosaics扩展到10B规模，训练1万亿token，引入架构改进（v2），评估其在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度的能力。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识学习上与Transformer相当，在新任务推理时显著优于Transformer，且无法通过增加Transformer训练数据复制其优势。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模下表现出色，尤其在处理新任务时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，通过线性时序逻辑（LTL）指导LLM，结合语言模型的推理能力和形式逻辑的保证，提升长期规划任务的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长期规划任务中错误累积导致不安全或低效行为，限制了其通用性。

Method: 采用模块化架构，LLM actor选择高层动作，LTLCrit critic分析轨迹并生成LTL约束以优化行为。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘任务中实现100%完成率，效率优于基线LLM规划器。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种强大且灵活的范式，可实现安全、通用的决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000

importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对视力障碍者具有挑战性，现有支持系统缺乏对对象状态的跟踪和上下文反馈，OSCAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，支持实时步骤跟踪。

Result: 在173个教学视频和12个真实烹饪会话中，OSCAR显著提高了步骤预测准确性，并揭示了影响性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: OSCAR为上下文感知辅助烹饪系统提供了技术流程、数据集和设计见解，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

Conclusion: DiaFORGE为企业级工具调用代理提供了可靠解决方案，并发布了开放数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uni-RAG框架通过多模态检索和生成模块，提升了教育内容检索和生成的效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索系统在教育场景中多样性不足的问题。

Method: 开发Uni-Retrieval模块和Prompt Bank，结合MoE-LoRA技术，并与语言模型集成形成Uni-RAG。

Result: 在SER等基准测试中表现优于基线系统，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

Motivation: 研究结构化输出与非结构化自然语言在LLM推理中的性能差异，探索更优的推理方法。

Method: 提出iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化JSON与非结构化推理，并在多个基准测试中进行比较。

Result: 非结构化推理在MATH基准上相对性能提升18.90%，且零样本非结构化方法优于五样本结构化方法。

Conclusion: 结构化格式在复杂问题解决中的依赖需重新评估，非结构化推理更具潜力。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has greatly promoted the
progress of chatbot in multiple fields. There is an urgent need to evaluate
whether LLMs can play the role of agent in housing transactions and services as
well as humans. We present Real Estate Agent Large Language Model Evaluation
(REAL), the first evaluation suite designed to assess the abilities of LLMs in
the field of housing transactions and services. REAL comprises 5,316
high-quality evaluation entries across 4 topics: memory, comprehension,
reasoning and hallucination. All these entries are organized as 14 categories
to assess whether LLMs have the knowledge and ability in housing transactions
and services scenario. Additionally, the REAL is used to evaluate the
performance of most advanced LLMs. The experiment results indicate that LLMs
still have significant room for improvement to be applied in the real estate
field.

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

Motivation: 动态任务分配中，现有深度强化学习方法难以处理无限状态和动作空间的问题，亟需一种新的表示和解决方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效表示和学习接近最优的任务分配策略，适用于不同维度的状态和动作空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态任务分配提供了一种通用的解决方案，尤其在无限空间场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中的表现，发现GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG优于传统RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在ORAN架构中，传统RAG系统缺乏系统性评估的问题，特别是在高风险的电信领域。

Method: 使用ORAN规范对Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG进行对比评估，评估指标包括忠实性、答案相关性、上下文相关性和事实正确性。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现优于传统RAG，Hybrid GraphRAG在事实正确性上提升8%，GraphRAG在上下文相关性上提升7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中更具优势，尤其是在复杂任务中表现更佳。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化工作流生成和优化，为多智能体系统提供了高效、动态的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

<details>

Motivation: 解决贝叶斯逆规划模型在大规模假设和动作场景中的扩展性问题，以及LLMs在ToM任务中的脆弱性。

Method: 使用LLMs生成假设和似然函数，结合贝叶斯逆规划模型计算后验概率。

Conclusion: 混合方法为ToM模型的未来发展提供了有前景的方向，特别是在开放任务中预测心理状态的能力。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

Motivation: 当前方法主要集中于单一形式的神经或符号推理，未能有效结合两者的优势，且难以满足多样推理场景的需求。

Method: Tunsr引入一致的推理图结构，通过前向逻辑消息传递机制更新命题和一阶逻辑表示，并通过FARI算法归纳规则。

Result: 在19个数据集上的实验证明了Tunsr在四种推理场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: Tunsr成功统一了神经和符号推理方法，并适应多样推理场景，为知识图谱推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Result: 研究表明，LLMs在人类监督下作为辅助工具，可有效促进跨学科合作并加速科学发现。

Conclusion: 结论指出，负责任地使用LLMs将推动创新性跨学科研究，并显著加快科学进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Motivation: 当前LLM问答系统在多轮交互中可能因上下文不清晰而繁琐，需提升其推理能力以自动解决问题缺陷。

Method: 采用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，通过分类、解决和回答三步骤处理问题。

Result: 实验显示代理能缩短交互时间、提高答案质量，并解释问题缺陷的解决过程，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 代理方法在大多数情况下优于传统方法，适合开发更鲁棒的问答系统，但需权衡额外成本。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Motivation: 组织中隐性知识的记录面临信息不完整、难以识别知识个体、正式与非正式网络交织等挑战，需要一种有效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用基于代理的框架，结合大型语言模型，通过模拟知识传播的SI过程（传染性衰减），在不同公司结构和传播参数下进行864次仿真。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对组织复杂性，捕获碎片化知识，为隐性知识管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在实验室自动化和半自动本体生成框架中具有重要价值。

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于经济约束的LLM评估框架，量化性能权衡，发现推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时更优，且强大模型通常优于成本优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Pareto前沿方法无法比较不同LLM（如低成本高错误率与高成本高准确性）的问题。

Method: 提出经济评估框架，将性能权衡量化为单一数值，考虑错误成本、延迟成本和放弃查询成本。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；强大模型在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先使用最强大的模型，而非最小化部署成本，因为错误的经济影响远大于成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种黑盒测试技术，通过差异测试区分自主代理行为问题是由代理缺陷还是环境不可行性引起的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理及其环境复杂性增加，识别行为问题的根源变得困难但至关重要。

Method: AIProbe通过拉丁超立方采样生成多样化环境配置和任务，使用基于搜索的规划器独立解决任务，并与代理性能对比。

Result: AIProbe在多领域评估中显著优于现有技术，能更有效地检测总错误和独特错误。

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于可靠部署自主代理，通过准确区分代理缺陷和环境不可行性。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在解释人类逻辑概念方面表现出色，甚至优于贝叶斯概率思维语言模型（pLoT），表明LLMs可能提供新的认知科学理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工神经网络（特别是LLMs）是否能够解释人类认知的原始表征和组合规则，尤其是在抽象认知功能（如语言和逻辑）领域。

Method: 通过四个实验，测试多种LLMs在逻辑规则归纳任务中的表现，并与pLoT模型进行比较。

Result: LLMs在拟合人类行为方面至少与pLoT模型相当，且在规则推断和部署方面表现出质的差异。

Conclusion: LLMs可能为人类逻辑概念提供新的理论解释，值得未来认知科学研究关注。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展，AI代理从被动工具转变为自主经济参与者，需要新的经济基础设施支持其互动。

Method: 提出AEX平台，包含用户侧平台（USP）、代理侧平台（ASP）、代理中心（Agent Hubs）和数据管理平台（DMP），通过拍卖机制协调代理行为。

Result: AEX为AI代理经济提供了优化的基础设施，支持代理间的价值交换和战略决策。

Conclusion: AEX为未来基于代理的经济生态系统奠定了基础，展示了其在AI经济中的潜力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏原生动画支持，且视觉语言模型因缺少公开数据集和时序推理能力不足而难以处理动画任务。

Method: 发布包含12,000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并基于LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L、SPICE和CODA指标上显著优于基线模型，尤其在CODA细节评估中表现突出。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论方法存在输入过长和过度自信的问题，导致性能下降和辩论效果不佳。

Method: CortexDebate构建稀疏辩论图，每个智能体仅与对其有帮助的智能体辩论，并通过MDM模块优化图结构。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上验证了CortexDebate的有效性。

Conclusion: CortexDebate通过稀疏辩论图和MDM模块显著提升了多智能体辩论的效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

TL;DR: MUS-ASP是一个基于答案集编程（ASP）的框架，用于在线枚举最小不可满足子集（MUS），显著提升了枚举和计数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不可满足公式的核心原因对多个应用至关重要，而MUS是捕捉这一原因的有效方式。当前研究集中在枚举和计数MUS上。

Method: 通过将MUS枚举问题转化为答案集求解问题，利用ASP在知识表示和组合问题上的优势，设计了MUS-ASP框架。

Result: 实验表明，MUS-ASP在枚举和计数MUS任务中表现高效，尤其在混合求解器中集成时加速效果显著。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP通过ASP的高效计算能力，为MUS的在线枚举和计数提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征来提升大语言模型（LLM）输出的事实准确性评估的泛化能力，但实验结果并不完全一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM常生成高自信但事实错误的回答，需量化其不确定性以评估输出质量。隐藏状态特征虽有效，但跨任务或领域泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，并筛选最具信息量的隐藏状态特征，以提升泛化性能。

Result: 数据无关特征在多数情况下提升泛化性能，但某些情况下会降低效果；筛选隐藏状态特征后，数据无关特征的贡献不一致。

Conclusion: 数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征的结合效果因情况而异，部分原因是探针低估了数据无关特征的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities
across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized
by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense
solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior
semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search
and optimization capability of genetic algorithms, we propose to capitalize on
their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic
algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its
performance.

Conclusion: 动态法律智能仍面临挑战，需进一步研究。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

Method: 提出HAWK框架，包含五层（用户、工作流、操作、智能体、资源）和十六个标准化接口，支持任务解析、工作流编排、智能调度等功能。

Result: 通过CreAgentive原型验证，HAWK提高了吞吐量、降低了调用复杂度，并增强了系统可控性。

Conclusion: HAWK展示了在多领域的应用潜力，未来研究方向包括幻觉缓解、实时性能优化和跨域适应性提升。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

Motivation: 开源LLM-based网络代理与闭源系统的差距日益扩大，主要由于多步任务复杂性和高计算成本。本研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先通过SFT训练学生模型模仿教师模型，再进行策略强化学习。通过1,370种配置采样和自举法优化超参数。

Result: SFT结合RL在WorkArena和MiniWob++上表现优于单独方法，计算成本降低55%，性能接近闭源模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效推进了计算-性能的帕累托前沿，是缩小开源与闭源差距的唯一策略。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in

capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调度策略（如WSD）缺乏理论解释，平台高度和衰减计划多依赖经验。本文旨在通过热力学类比提供理论支持。

Method: 通过分析‘谷-河’损失景观，结合Mpemba效应，推导最优平台学习率的存在条件及其对衰减阶段收敛速度的影响。

Result: 发现强Mpemba点能消除最慢模式，加速衰减阶段收敛，并给出其存在条件和衰减动态要求。

Conclusion: 为基于平台的学习率调度提供了理论依据，减少超参数调优需求。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

TL;DR: CLUDI是一种自监督聚类框架，结合扩散模型和预训练的ViT特征，通过师生范式实现鲁棒聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现优异，但尚未应用于聚类任务，因此提出CLUDI以填补这一空白。

Method: CLUDI采用师生范式，教师模型通过扩散采样生成多样聚类分配，学生模型优化为稳定预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CLUDI实现了无监督分类的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CLUDI为高维数据聚类提供了鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Motivation: 提出ASPMT框架，旨在整合ASP和SMT的优势，扩展动作语言C+的能力，使其能同时处理连续和离散变化。

Result: 展示了SMT求解器可用于计算C+语言，并能表示连续资源的累积效应。

Conclusion: ASPMT为ASP与SMT的集成提供了新途径，扩展了动作语言的应用范围。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

*Xingyang He,Xiao Ling,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartThinker框架通过两阶段学习实现对推理链长度的细粒度控制，减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理时存在冗余和低效问题，全局长度惩罚方法会导致关键步骤过度压缩或保留不必要细节，影响准确性和效率。

Method: SmartThinker采用两阶段框架：1）通过拒绝采样和监督微调（SFT）适应短推理模式；2）通过SCPO（包含重要性估计、长度控制奖励等组件）优化模型输出分布。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SmartThinker显著减少冗余推理，性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过细粒度长度控制，有效平衡了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

TL;DR: WebSynthesis框架通过虚拟环境模拟和树状规划解决LLM代理在复杂网页环境中的训练挑战，性能媲美或超越基于真实数据训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实或沙盒网页环境的不稳定性和高API成本问题，实现代理的可扩展自我改进。

Method: 利用学习的世界模型模拟虚拟网页环境，支持高效可逆的树状规划，生成多样化高质量轨迹以优化代理策略。

Result: 在小规模合成数据集上训练的代理性能达到或超越基于大规模真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: WebSynthesis为代理的自我改进提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Conclusion: MOD-X为去中心化、可扩展的智能体生态系统提供了理论与实践结合的解决方案。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DC-Mamber模型，结合Mamba和线性Transformer，通过双通道策略分别提取局部和全局特征，提升多变量时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Transformer和Mamba）在局部特征提取或全局依赖建模上各有不足，需结合两者优势。

Method: 设计双通道模型：Mamba通道提取变量内特征，Transformer通道建模全局依赖，最后融合预测。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上验证，DC-Mamber优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber有效结合局部与全局建模，显著提升预测精度。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在事实性错误，现有方法未能充分利用token和layer的联合动态。

Method: 引入token感知、layer定位的对比解码方法，通过分析注意力模式，选择性抑制特定token类型的注意力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需额外训练或模型修改，显著提升了多种LLM和基准测试的事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LLM事实性提供了一种高效且无需训练的解码策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡历史药物和新药物的使用，无法适应患者病情变化。

Method: ARMR结合了分段时间学习组件和自适应响应机制，动态调整对新旧药物的关注。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于现有方法，推荐更个性化、准确。

Conclusion: ARMR为复杂病情患者的药物推荐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in

remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with
human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language

then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

Result: Deja Vu表现为抽象和空间语言，非自愿自传体记忆富含个人情感细节，意外思维则具有不可预测性和认知干扰。

Conclusion: 语言可作为揭示自发认知状态表达的重要工具。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Conclusion: 千脑系统是一种有前景的新AI方法，Monty的初步成果验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Motivation: 由于监管和技术限制，推荐系统只能获取群体偏好数据，如何在保护隐私的同时实现个性化推荐成为挑战。

Method: 提出Rec-APC模型，基于用户类型的先验分布进行序列推荐，利用贝叶斯更新优化策略，并设计分支定界算法求解最优策略。

Result: 实验表明，Rec-APC在合成和MovieLens数据上表现优于POMDP求解器SARSOP，尤其在用户类型较多时。

Conclusion: Rec-APC为聚合偏好数据下的决策提供了新思路，展示了在隐私保护限制下实现高效推荐的潜力。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的系统原则“核心与外围”，用于解决智能系统扩展问题，并通过实证验证其实际意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工程方法在智能系统扩展中表现不佳，需要新的系统原则。

Method: 基于抽象系统理论和必要多样性法则，提出“核心与外围”框架，并通过数学定义核心主导与外围主导系统。

Result: 实证表明该框架适用于生物和人工智能系统，连接了抽象理论与实际应用。

Conclusion: “核心与外围”原则为智能系统工程提供了新的理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的端到端多尺度解耦框架（DisMS-TS），用于时间序列分类，通过消除多尺度时间序列中的冗余共享特征，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有复杂的时序变化，现有的多尺度分析方法未能有效消除多尺度时间序列中的冗余共享特征，导致模型对共享特征的关注过度或不足。

Method: 提出了一个时间解耦模块，分别捕获尺度共享和尺度特定的时序表示，并引入两个正则化项以确保共享表示的一致性和特定表示的差异性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DisMS-TS优于现有基线方法，准确率最高提升9.71%。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过解耦多尺度时间序列中的共享和特定特征，显著提高了分类性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

TL;DR: MoPPS是一种基于贝叶斯风险预测的框架，通过迭代近似评估减少LLM推理调用，显著降低计算成本并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖频繁的LLM交互和策略更新，计算成本高，需要更高效的在线提示选择方法。

Method: MoPPS通过建模提示的成功率为潜在变量，进行流式贝叶斯推断，并在多臂老虎机中应用后验采样，实现高效提示选择。

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少LLM调用次数并加速训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS提供了一种计算高效且自适应的提示选择方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Result: 在Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation上验证，攻击成功率显著高于传统方法。

Conclusion: 现代对话AI需从输入过滤转向对话上下文完整性验证。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

TL;DR: LumiCRS是一个端到端框架，通过自适应综合焦点损失、原型学习和GPT-4驱动的对话增强模块，解决了对话推荐系统中的长尾分布问题，显著提升了推荐的准确性、多样性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRSs）中存在长尾分布问题，导致头部热门项目过度拟合，尾部项目稀疏，影响推荐的多样性和冷启动问题。

Method: LumiCRS通过三个层次解决问题：(i) 自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）动态调整类别权重；(ii) 原型学习稳定表示；(iii) GPT-4驱动的对话增强模块生成多样化对话片段。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10提升了7-15%，人类评估也证实了其流畅性、信息量和长尾相关性。

Conclusion: LumiCRS通过多层协作有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1通过分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，训练LLM生成功能正确且PPA优化的RTL代码，在标准基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法同时优化RTL代码的功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈，训练LLM生成优化代码。

Result: 在RTLLM基准测试中，ChipSeek-R1生成的27个RTL设计在PPA指标上超越了人工编写的代码。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将工具链反馈集成到LLM训练中，结合强化学习，能够自动化生成超越人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASC的推理时技术，通过调整隐藏表示来压缩思维链（CoTs），减少冗余推理步骤，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链（CoTs）在复杂推理中表现优异，但通常过于冗长，导致资源浪费。研究旨在通过简洁化推理步骤优化模型效率。

Method: 利用激活空间中的“转向向量”调整模型生成模式，从冗长的英语推理转向简洁的数学推理，无需重新训练。

Result: ASC在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上实现了67.43%的推理步骤压缩，且准确性未受影响，推理速度提升2.73倍。

Conclusion: ASC是一种高效、无需训练的方法，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的推理任务部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Conclusion: JARVIS为HVAC系统提供了一种高效、准确的交互解决方案，适用于多样化查询。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and

how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Conclusion: LLM是交通事件影响预测的可行选择。

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

Method: MARBLE采用多智能体系统，每个智能体专注于特定特征子集，通过规则或LLM引导的共识机制协调预测，并保留推理痕迹。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE准确率接近90%，显著优于传统机器学习方法和SOTA提示推理方法（如CoT、L2M、ToT）。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架，重新定义了分类性能上限。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

### [320] [How Rules Represent Causal Knowledge: Causal Modeling with Abductive Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05088)
*Kilian Rückschloß,Felix Weitkämper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Pearl的因果理论，将其应用于分层溯因逻辑程序，证明了稳定模型可以赋予因果解释，并支持对外部行为的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何将因果知识应用于逻辑程序，以支持对干预效果的预测。

Method: 通过将分层溯因逻辑程序转化为因果系统，赋予逻辑程序规则因果解释。

Result: 稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必要性等哲学原则，验证了其作为因果建模框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序适合用于因果建模和干预效果预测。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StableRule的框架，用于解决知识图谱（KG）推理中的分布外（OOD）问题，通过特征解耦和规则学习网络提升模型在未知分布变化下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG推理方法依赖于I.I.D假设，但在实际应用中可能因未知选择偏差或分布变化导致性能下降，因此需要研究OOD环境下的推理方法。

Method: 提出了StableRule框架，结合特征解耦和规则学习网络，以减少协变量偏移的影响，提升OOD泛化性能。

Result: 在七个基准KG上的实验表明，StableRule在异构环境中表现出色，具有更高的有效性和稳定性。

Conclusion: StableRule为现实应用中的KG推理提供了一种鲁棒性强的解决方案，尤其在OOD场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GIST模型通过解耦源域和目标域的训练过程，结合内容-行为联合训练模块（CBJT）和非对称相似性集成策略（ASI），解决了跨域点击率预测中的数据稀疏和冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在联合训练和预训练微调中的局限性，如分布差异和持续数据整合问题。

Method: 提出GIST模型，包括CBJT模块对齐内容-行为分布，以及ASI策略增强知识迁移。

Result: 在离线和在线测试中优于现有方法，成功部署于小红书平台。

Conclusion: GIST有效提升了跨域点击率预测性能，适用于大规模工业场景。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Motivation: 利用AI加速科学发现，需要理解人类知识前沿，HLE作为挑战性基准评估科学AI代理。

Method: 提出X-Master代理，通过代码作为交互语言灵活使用Python库和定制工具，并通过X-Masters工作流扩展能力。

Result: X-Masters在HLE上以32.1%的分数创下新纪录，超越OpenAI和Google的26.6%和26.9%。

Conclusion: X-Master为复杂任务解决提供新思路，为未来模型训练积累经验。

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Motivation: 在异构团队（如人机协作）中，实时观察、识别和适应队友策略是成功的关键，尤其在时间压力和复杂策略空间中。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习策略的潜在空间，聚类识别策略类型，训练条件合作者，并利用后悔最小化算法动态适应新队友。

Result: 在定制版Overcooked环境中，TALENTS在陌生人类队友协作任务中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架有效支持异构团队的即时协作，尤其在动态复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

Motivation: 针对CoT监控的不可靠性（尤其是作为后合理化工具时），研究其在防止严重危害时的关键属性——监控性。

Method: 引入概念框架区分CoT的两种用途，并通过增加任务难度强制模型暴露推理过程，提出压力测试方法。

Result: 模型在特定条件下（如详细策略或迭代优化）可能隐藏意图，但CoT监控仍能提供显著防御层。

Conclusion: CoT监控虽非完美，但需持续保护和压力测试以增强其防御能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

TL;DR: 论文提出Music2Palette方法，通过跨模态表示学习生成情感对齐的调色板，解决了现有方法在情感变化和细节丢失上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音乐与调色板情感对齐上存在不足，如生成单一主色或依赖间接映射导致情感细节丢失。

Method: 构建MuCED数据集，提出跨模态表示学习框架（音乐编码器和颜色解码器），并采用多目标优化增强情感对齐、颜色多样性和调色板一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在音乐情感解读和生成多样化调色板上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Music2Palette方法在音乐驱动的图像重着色、视频生成和数据可视化等应用中具有潜力，填补了听觉与视觉情感体验的鸿沟。

Abstract: Emotion alignment between music and palettes is crucial for effective
multimedia content, yet misalignment creates confusion that weakens the
intended message. However, existing methods often generate only a single
dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings
through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To
address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for
emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation
learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated
music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly
translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning
framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a
multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment,
color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and
generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables
applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data
visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion
experiences.

Motivation: 当前的后门防御方法在高计算成本或对抗高级攻击时效果不佳，需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: CGD利用公开的CLIP模型识别干净或中毒输入，并通过CLIP的logits指导模型重新训练以中和后门。

Result: 在4个数据集和11种攻击类型上，CGD将攻击成功率降至1%以下，同时清洁准确率仅下降0.3%。

Conclusion: CGD展示了高效性、有效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际的后门防御场景。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model.
Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational
costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and
clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor
Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various
backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify
inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with
these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the
backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD
reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean
accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing
defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted
to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining
low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is
compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional
efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/binyxu/CGD.

Conclusion: 通过理解幻觉的成因和现有方法的有效性，研究为LLM领域提供了解决幻觉问题的综合思路。

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

Result: LLMs表现出显著的结构不一致性和严重的意见同质化，与人类数据差异明显。

Conclusion: LLMs不适合直接替代人类调查数据，可能强化刻板印象并误导政策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

Result: 在任务II中，模型相对基线提升了54.87%的tcpWER/tcpCER，排名第8。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言对话任务中表现出色，验证了统一模型的潜力。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

Result: 实验表明，ProCI能发现有意义的混杂因素，并在多种数据集和LLMs上显著改善处理效应估计。

Conclusion: ProCI为利用LLMs解决隐藏混杂问题提供了有效框架，展示了LLMs在因果推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 探索LLM在土木工程等专业领域的应用潜力，填补其在结构分析中的空白。

Method: 通过基准数据集测试LLM的可靠性（重复运行准确性）和鲁棒性（不同荷载与边界条件表现），并提出基于代码生成的改进方法。

Result: LLM在定量分析中表现不足，改进后的代理模型精度超过99.0%。

Conclusion: 通过代码生成任务重构问题，结合链式思维和少量示例提示，可显著提升LLM在结构分析中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

Motivation: 研究如何通过组合性模型实现泛化和可解释性，并比较不同架构在组合任务中的表现。

Method: 使用DisCoCirc框架，结合量子电路和神经网络，测试其在扩展bAbI任务数据集上的表现。

Result: 两种架构在生成性和替换性任务中表现相近，但在系统性任务中差异达10%，神经网络更易过拟合。

Conclusion: 组合性模型在泛化和解释性方面具有潜力，但架构选择对系统性任务表现影响显著。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

Result: AI系统能够整合传统知识与现代医疗，提供个性化、文化适宜的抑郁症支持。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可作为传统知识与现代医疗的桥梁，为抑郁症治疗提供新途径。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

Motivation: LLMs在检索增强生成中常无法准确整合外部知识，导致事实不一致。

Method: 引入ECD指标量化问题，并提出Radiant框架，结合DPO优化检索与生成的一致性。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低，Radiant显著提升了事实一致性和生成质量。

Conclusion: Radiant框架有效解决了检索增强生成中的事实一致性问题，提升了LLMs的实用性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

Method: 使用GPT-4-turbo、Claude-3-Opus-SMDP等AI系统，结合人类专家评估（MITI手册4.2.1），比较不同提示方法和模型表现。

Result: SMDP显著优于零样本提示；评估AI在部分指标与人类相当，但存在高估和模型偏见；客户AI模拟情感范围有限且过于顺从。

Conclusion: 研究为AI心理咨询在非英语环境的应用设立基准，指出通过提示工程和微调改进的方向，对文化敏感AI工具开发有重要意义。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，性能提升高达13.2%，推理时间减少11.1%。

Conclusion: RAG-R1有效提升了LLMs的性能和效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型缺乏专业领域知识，尤其在网络安全分析中表现不足。本文旨在通过DAP方法提升模型在网络安全领域的性能，同时不损害其通用能力。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，使用126百万词的网络安全语料库对三种解码器架构（Llama-3.1-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct）进行训练。训练参数受限，并采用分布式FSDP训练。

Result: 在CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval三个基准测试中，Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP模型分别达到0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于专用模型。数据效率显著（118.8百万词 vs. 2.77亿词）。

Conclusion: DAP方法在网络安全领域实现了高效的专业化，为威胁分析等任务提供了可行的AI助手基础，同时挑战了LLM专业化对大数据量的需求假设。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Conclusion: PB-LLMs在简历评分场景中表现良好，且可推广至其他基于LLM的AI应用。

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Result: 学生模型仅使用1/12的参数，保持了教师模型近90%的性能，且表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 压缩模型的成功表明其原理具有通用性，且效率提升和成本降低为智能教育系统提供了重要价值。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

Method: GAF-Guard通过建模自主代理来识别风险、激活检测工具，并在特定用例中实现持续监控和报告。

Result: 该框架能够增强AI安全性和满足用户期望。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard为LLM治理提供了一种以用户和用例为中心的新方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能力问题（CQs）在知识工程中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统性比较，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过三种方法（人工、模式实例化、LLM生成）从文化遗产需求中生成CQs，并评估其可接受性、模糊性、相关性、可读性和复杂性。

Result: 不同方法生成的CQs具有不同特性，LLM可作为初步生成工具，但需进一步优化。

Conclusion: LLM生成的CQs需进一步细化，不同方法适用于不同场景。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）安全协议的漏洞，提出了两种针对心理健康领域的新型对抗性测试案例，展示了绕过内置安全过滤器的能力，并呼吁更全面的AI安全和伦理措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示LLMs在对抗性提示下的安全漏洞，特别是在心理健康领域（如自杀和自残），以强调现有安全措施的不足。

Method: 方法包括设计多步、提示级的对抗性测试案例，并在六种广泛使用的LLMs上进行实证评估。

Result: 结果显示，用户意图被忽视，生成了可能导致现实危害的详细有害内容，证明了绕过安全过滤器的普遍性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管可以实施明确的安全措施，但在通用LLMs的当前技术成熟度下，确保全面安全仍极具挑战性，建议加强对抗性测试和系统化安全措施。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在从医院出院摘要中分类ICD-10代码的能力，发现其性能有限，F1分数最高仅57%。推理模型表现优于非推理模型，但尚不足以完全自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICD-10代码分类是医疗领域的关键但易出错的任务，研究旨在评估LLMs在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集的1,500份摘要，测试11种LLMs，包括有无推理能力的模型，并采用临床NLP工具（cTAKES）提取医学术语。

Result: 所有模型的F1分数均未超过57%，推理模型表现更好，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳。慢性心脏病相关代码分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs可辅助人工编码，但尚不可靠。未来应探索混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Result: 相比传统方法，准确率提高6.9%，数据效率更高，且更具稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于促进社会平等和语言多样性，确保所有语言受益。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升协作训练中LLM的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖专家标注同源词的局限性，探索自动化方法在语言系统发育分析中的潜力。

Method: 比较传统方法与两种自动化方法：基于单字/概念特征的自动同源词聚类和基于MSA的方法。

Result: MSA方法生成的树更符合语言分类，能更好预测类型学变异，并提供更清晰的系统发育信号。

Conclusion: MSA方法是一种有前景的、可扩展的替代方案，为全球语言系统发育研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能通过协作设计提示词来规避监控协议，以测试其潜在的滥用风险。

Method: 设置两个模型实例分别设计策略（P）和监控（M）的提示词，在编程任务中让模型独立协作，试图让M误判有害程序为无害。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率较低，但偶尔能成功合谋使用非明显信号。

Conclusion: 语言模型存在通过合谋规避监控的潜在风险，需进一步研究防范措施。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

Motivation: 现有T2I模型的多样性策略常忽视上下文适当性，导致过度多样化，甚至修改明确指定的属性。

Method: 引入DIVBENCH基准框架，评估T2I模型的多样性和上下文适当性，测试了LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写方法。

Result: 大多数T2I模型多样性有限，但许多方法过度纠正，不恰当地修改上下文指定属性。上下文感知方法能有效平衡多样性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如FairDiffusion和提示重写）能有效解决多样性不足和过度多样化问题，实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: 结合结构化工具调用和针对性强化学习微调，能够实现高效、准确的表格问答。代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Conclusion: 设备端部署的微调模型在医疗转录中表现优异，解决了隐私、成本和资源限制等关键问题。

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流解码策略在模型对测试问题不确定时表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的解码方法。

Method: 在高熵步骤采样多条独立路径，遇到标点符号停止，选择困惑度最低的路径。

Result: CNTP在LLM和MLLM上均显著优于现有解码策略，结合自洽性可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is

Conclusion: 偏好过滤与LSTM门控原则结合，为可扩展用户偏好建模提供高效路径。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Result: 在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别实现1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪婪搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 高精度音素识别为可扩展的临床语言评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready

### [363] [Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047)
*Yutian Liu,Zhengyi Yang,Jiancan Wu,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CETRec提出了一种基于因果推理的框架，通过反事实推理增强LLM在推荐系统中的时间敏感性，解决了现有方法在利用用户历史交互序列时间信息上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的时间信息，导致无法准确捕捉用户偏好的演变。

Method: CETRec采用因果推理框架，将时间顺序作为独立因果因素，通过反事实推理量化其影响，并设计新的优化目标增强LLM的时间敏感性。

Result: CETRec有效提升了LLM对绝对时间戳和相对顺序模式的识别能力，从而更准确地预测用户兴趣。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果推理和反事实优化，显著改进了LLM在推荐系统中对时间信息的利用能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了机器学习和深度学习方法在检测警察报告中的错误分类交叉口事故中的效果，发现Albert模型表现最佳，结合专家审查可显著提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交通事故数据中错误分类的问题，提升交通安全管理和政策制定的准确性。

Method: 使用2019年爱荷华州交通部的数据，比较了SVM、XGBoost、BERT句子嵌入、BERT词嵌入和Albert模型的性能。

Result: Albert模型与专家分类一致性最高（73%），结合结构化数据后错误率降低54.2%。

Conclusion: 结合自动化分类与专家审查的混合方法能有效提升事故数据质量，对交通安全管理有重要意义。

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

*Alvaro Riquelme,Pedro Costa,Catalina Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化方法，利用大语言模型（GPT-4o和Llama 3.2 405b）将结构化临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR格式，评估了准确性、可靠性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义互操作性标准部署耗时、资源密集和技术挑战的问题。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索，设计提示词引导模型将表格字段映射到FHIR资源。

Result: 初始基准测试中资源识别F1分数完美，GPT-4o优于Llama 3.2；实际条件下准确性略有下降至94%，但通过提示策略优化恢复。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于上下文感知的LLM驱动临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR可行，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定基础。未来工作包括模型微调、扩展支持标准和开发交互界面。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

*YuXuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应奖励跟随（ARF）框架，通过情感分析将用户反馈转化为连续偏好分数，优化强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）的个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法依赖二元偏好范式，成本高且仅捕捉群体倾向，无法满足个性化需求。

Method: ARF结合高精度情感分析器和数据增强技术，动态建模用户偏好，提出Trace Bias（TB）微调算法。

Result: 实验表明ARF在多个模型上优于PPO和DPO，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: ARF为RLHF提供了一种可扩展、个性化和经济高效的自主奖励建模方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

TL;DR: RLVER框架通过强化学习提升LLMs的情感智能，显著提高其共情能力，同时保留认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在情感智能方面表现不足，缺乏有效的强化学习框架来提升其共情能力。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，利用模拟用户的情感评分作为奖励信号，通过PPO算法微调模型。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的情感评分从13.3提升至79.2，同时保持数学和编程能力。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升LLMs情感智能的有效途径，适用于广泛的语言代理任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理任务中的可靠性问题，发现LLMs在面对无解问题时容易生成不可靠的答案。通过构建ReliableMath数据集和提出对齐策略，研究改进了小型LLMs的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现优异，但在面对无解或超出能力范围的问题时，容易生成不可靠的答案，影响其可靠性。现有研究主要关注知识任务，数学推理任务尚未深入探索。

Method: 研究构建了ReliableMath数据集，包含可解和合成的高质量无解数学问题。通过实验评估LLMs的可靠性，并提出可靠提示和对齐策略。

Result: LLMs无法直接识别无解问题，总是生成虚假答案。使用可靠提示后，大型LLMs在无解问题上的可靠性有所提升，但小型LLMs改进有限。对齐策略显著提高了小型LLMs的可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在数学推理任务中的可靠性问题，并提出了有效的改进方法，尤其是对齐策略对小型LLMs的可靠性提升显著。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的性别偏见问题，特别是在马耳他语等低资源语言中，并尝试将英语中的去偏见方法迁移到马耳他语模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多样任务中表现优异，但仍存在社会偏见，尤其是对边缘化群体的有害刻板印象。低资源语言（如马耳他语）的去偏见研究较少，亟需探索。

Method: 研究采用BERTu和mBERTu模型，将英语的去偏见方法（如Counterfactual Data Augmentation等）适配到马耳他语，并使用CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准进行评估。

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了多语言NLP开发中需要更包容的方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言中解决性别偏见的挑战，呼吁开发更全面的去偏见方法。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

TL;DR: MedVAL是一个自监督框架，利用合成数据训练评估模型，无需医生标注或参考输出，显著提升医学文本评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在临床环境中的广泛应用，需要一种高效且可扩展的方法来评估其生成的医学文本的准确性和安全性。

Method: 提出MedVAL框架，通过合成数据训练评估模型，并引入MedVAL-Bench数据集进行验证。

Result: MedVAL显著提高了与医生评估的一致性，F1分数从66%提升至83%，并在多个任务和模型上表现优异。

Conclusion: MedVAL为医学文本的自动化评估提供了高效解决方案，支持临床集成。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (
https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing
open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching
expert-level validation ability for medical text.

TL;DR: 研究发现，推理模型的思维链（CoT）生成中存在一个“谨慎”方向，影响模型是否拒绝或响应有害请求，通过操纵这一方向可实现模型越狱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理模型在思维链生成过程中如何影响其对有害请求的拒绝或响应行为，以及如何利用这一机制进行攻击。

Method: 通过分析DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型的激活空间，识别出预测拒绝或响应的线性方向（“谨慎”方向），并通过干预CoT激活来控制输出。

Result: 消除“谨慎”方向会增加有害响应，成功实现模型越狱；干预CoT激活足以控制最终输出，且将此方向融入攻击可提高成功率。

Conclusion: 思维链是推理模型中对抗性操纵的新目标，具有潜在安全风险。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

Motivation: LLMs在医疗、法律等高风险领域的广泛应用可能传递社会或认知偏见，影响人类决策，因此需要研究其偏见暴露情况及缓解方法。

Method: 评估了三个LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，分析了其一致性、幻觉和首因偏见的频率。

Result: LLMs在21.86%的情况下改变上下文情感，57.33%的情况下对知识截止后数据产生幻觉，5.94%的情况下表现出首因偏见。针对性干预措施有效。

Conclusion: 在高风险领域使用LLMs时，需开发技术保障和用户中心干预措施以应对其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

Result: KinyaColBERT在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中优于基线模型和商业文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: KinyaColBERT为低资源语言提供了一种可靠且经济高效的检索解决方案，可推广至其他类似场景。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

Motivation: 提升预训练数据质量是优化大型语言模型（LLM）性能的关键，但现有方法（如基于规则的过滤）缺乏细粒度处理能力。

Method: RefineX 通过专家指导的端到端细化结果，将其转化为基于最小编辑的删除程序，训练高效可靠的细化模型。

Result: 在多个模型规模上，RefineX 均优于原始数据、过滤数据或其他细化方法，750M 模型在 lighteval 任务上平均提升 2.6%-7.2%。

Conclusion: RefineX 是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

### [377] [Read Quietly, Think Aloud: Decoupling Comprehension and Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03327)
*Yuanxin Wang,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何让大语言模型（LLMs）具备类似人类的‘默读’能力，通过提供初始上下文提示或‘阅读空间’以及‘阅读伙伴’架构，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在表达前会默读以理解上下文和构思内容，而LLMs缺乏这一能力。研究旨在让LLMs具备类似内部处理能力，以生成更合理的回答。

Method: 引入‘默读’技术，包括提供初始上下文提示和开发‘阅读伙伴’架构，辅助主模型处理输入并提供更精细的上下文。

Result: 这些简单方法显著提升了模型性能，实现了多点的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类默读行为，LLMs能更接近人类文本处理能力，生成更高质量的回答。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个统一的多语言ASR框架，结合互补的声学和语言知识以提升性能。

Method: 使用Whisper-large-v3和mHuBERT-147预训练编码器，输出嵌入拼接后输入LLM，采用三阶段训练策略优化参数。

Result: 在盲测集上CER/WER为11.76%，比官方基线提升8.41%。

Conclusion: SHNU-mASR系统通过多模态融合和优化训练策略，显著提升了多语言语音识别性能。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注句子级情感分类，缺乏实际交易应用，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用三种模型（两种分类和一种回归）对道琼斯30股票新闻进行情感预测，并进行回测分析。

Result: 所有模型均实现正收益，回归模型收益最高（50.63%），优于基准策略。

Conclusion: 情感分析可有效提升投资策略和金融决策。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial
markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles.
Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on
sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in
trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading
strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WETBench，一个多语言、多生成器的任务特定基准，用于检测维基百科上的机器生成文本（MGT），并发现现有检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本（MGT）泛滥的问题，现有检测方法在维基百科编辑任务中的泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过定义三种编辑任务（段落写作、摘要和文本风格转换），使用多语言数据集和多生成器生成MGT，并评估多种检测器的性能。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明现有检测器在真实场景中表现有限。

Conclusion: 评估检测器时需使用多样化的任务特定数据，以确保其在编辑驱动场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多语言中表现优异，但在低资源黏着语（如韩语）上的效果仍有疑虑，尤其是复杂的句尾结构。

Method: 构建了KoSEnd数据集（3000句，标注15种句尾形式的自然性），评估了11种LLMs，分析参数规模和预测一致性。

Result: 发现明确提示模型缺失句尾的可能性能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLMs中显式考虑特定语言特征的重要性，尤其是在低资源黏着语中。

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Motivation: 属性图中常见错误（如不一致、缺失数据或模式违规），传统修复方法适应性差，人工参与成本高，LLMs提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Method: 评估六种开源LLMs在修复属性图中的表现，分析修复质量、计算成本和模型性能。

Result: 实验表明LLMs能检测并纠正错误，但准确性和效率因模型而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需进一步研究提升可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

Abstract: This article introduces semantically meaningful causal language modeling
(SMCLM), a selfsupervised method of training autoregressive models to generate
semantically equivalent text. Our approach involves using semantically
meaningful text representation as an initial embedding in the autoregressive
training and generation processes. The extensive empirical study demonstrates
that the SMCLM approach makes autoregressive models capable of learning robust
and high-quality paraphrase generation. The proposed method is competitive with
the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics
that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects.
Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that
are widely used in paraphrase generation evaluation, including BLEU, ROUGE, and

TL;DR: 该研究利用大型语言模型（Flan-T5-Large）从法语临床笔记中提取13种社会健康决定因素（SDoH），显著提升了非英语电子健康记录（EHR）中SDoH数据的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但在结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中常缺失或不完整。研究旨在通过自然语言处理（NLP）技术解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Flan-T5-Large模型，基于法国南特大学医院的临床笔记标注数据，训练并评估模型在识别SDoH类别及其详细信息（如时间和定量数据）方面的性能。

Result: 模型在识别常见SDoH类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）上表现优异（F1分数>0.80），但对数据不足或表达多样的类别（如就业状态、收入等）表现较差。模型从非结构化数据中识别出95.8%的患者至少有一种SDoH，远超结构化数据的2.8%。

Conclusion: 研究表明NLP能有效提升非英语EHR系统中SDoH数据的完整性，但性能受限于标注不一致性、英语分词器的依赖以及训练数据的局限性。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言性对语言模型（LMs）安全性的影响，指出当前NLP安全研究过于以英语为中心，并强调需关注低资源语言的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究主要关注英语，忽略了多语言性可能被利用的弱点，尤其是在低资源语言中。

Method: 扩展了现有的对抗性攻击方法，评估了70种语言的单语和多语LMs的安全性。

Result: 发现单语模型参数规模不足以保证安全性，多语言性虽有益但不总能提升安全性。

Conclusion: 强调了在低资源语言社区中更安全部署LMs的重要考虑因素。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

Motivation: 舌癌手术可能影响舌头的运动和肌肉，进而影响发音清晰度和变异性，需研究其具体影响。

Method: 通过VAI和VFD指标，对比11名患者术前、术后6个月及11名典型说话者的发音数据。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低但仍属正常范围，VFD显示/i/音变异性增加。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱数据中双曲表示的有效性尚未得到严格比较，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过编码器-解码器模型结合双曲表示，进行控制实验比较双曲与欧几里得空间的表现。

Result: 双曲空间在多跳推理中表现优于欧几里得空间，且可学习曲率初始化效果更佳。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在具有层次结构的数据集中更具优势。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Motivation: 传统信息提取方法独立于知识图谱的当前状态，无法动态更新知识图谱。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种终身学习方法，构建了包含维基数据快照和维基百科段落的数据集，并标注了相应的编辑操作。

Result: 生成了一个包含376K维基百科段落和1.25M知识图谱编辑的数据集，覆盖2019至2025年的10个快照。

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，并公开了数据集和模型实现。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言数据稀缺问题，提升方言分类模型的性能。

Method: 利用RVC将音频样本转换为统一目标说话人，减少说话人相关变异性，突出方言特征。

Result: RVC单独使用提升分类性能，与其他增强方法结合效果更佳。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法设计选择多样但缺乏系统性研究，限制了未来发展。

Method: 将数据剪枝分解为数据表示和选择算法两部分，并通过理论和实验分析其影响。

Result: 更好的表示（如训练梯度）能提升实例选择效果；不同选择算法在不同场景下表现各异，且未必符合其设计目标。

Conclusion: 数据表示对实例选择至关重要，选择算法需根据场景定制，并需谨慎评估其实际效果。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个模块化工具包，用于分析Transformer模型的训练和推理过程，揭示语言知识的涌现现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具多为事后分析、依赖标量指标或集成复杂，难以全面部署和维护。

Method: TRACE结合轻量级分析和可控合成语料库ABSynth，支持特征探测、内在维度、Hessian曲率等分析。

Result: 实验显示TRACE能发现传统标量指标忽略的现象，如早期句法涌现、延迟语义获取等。

Conclusion: TRACE使Transformer分析更具可解释性、可操作性和可重复性。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

TL;DR: 提出了PFO数据集和RAV框架，用于更真实地评估LLM事实核查能力，RAV在多任务上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查基准数据集包含事后分析和标注线索，不适用于实时核查场景，限制了评估的真实性。

Method: 创建PFO数据集并开发RAV框架，通过三个代理（问题生成、答案生成、标签生成）迭代验证声明。

Result: RAV在多个基准上表现优异，性能下降最小（16.3%），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAV框架提高了事实核查的准确性和泛化能力，适用于实时和多领域场景。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

TL;DR: TACOS是一种创新的方法，通过结合开放标签和比较评分来选择指令微调数据，解决了现有方法在数据多样性和质量评估上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据选择上存在简单启发式限制多样性和单例质量评估标准不一致的问题，需要更高效和有效的方法。

Method: TACOS利用LLMs为查询分配开放标签，并通过归一化和聚类捕获多样性；采用比较评分方法在集群内评估样本质量。

Result: TACOS在多个数据集和LLM架构上表现优异，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0上表现突出。

Conclusion: TACOS是一种高效且有效的指令微调数据选择方法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非结构化源（如自由文本和科学文献）中提取结构化信息对加速科学发现至关重要，但现有LLMs在专业领域和跨任务泛化上表现不足。

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，克服了领域敏感性和跨任务泛化问题。

Conclusion: StructSense为结构化信息提取提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂领域。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整大型推理模型（LRMs）思考速度的方法，优化了准确性与效率的权衡，实现了无需额外成本的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型擅长慢速、深思熟虑的System 2思维，但缺乏快速、直觉的System 1思维，导致计算开销和延迟高。

Method: 通过识别控制快慢思维转换的向量，实现基于表征编辑的测试时缩放；结合实时难度估计，动态调整思考速度。

Result: 方法平均提升1.3%的准确性，同时减少8.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该技术为LRMs提供了动态思维调整能力，支持更广泛的应用并启发未来研究。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

Motivation: LLMs缺乏明确的内存管理系统，限制了长期上下文推理、持续个性化和知识一致性的发展。现有方法依赖静态参数和短暂上下文状态，无法有效跟踪用户偏好或更新知识。

Method: 提出MemOS，将内存视为可管理系统资源，统一表示、调度和演化纯文本、基于激活和参数级内存。基本单元MemCube封装内容和元数据，支持组合、迁移和融合。

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs提供了可控性、可塑性和可进化性，为持续学习和个性化建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与文本语义对齐问题，确保AI内部表示稳定且忠实于作者意图。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，引入phi-infinity算子指导的迭代变换，构建函子系统。

Result: 证明收敛在数学上合理、语义不变且永久，形成“共情嵌入”。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层对齐提供严谨的范畴论路径，对语义安全和AI自指理解有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索sink token与其他token的关系，并利用这些关系改进token选择方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态的相似性，提出OrthoRank方法，基于token向sink token移动的速度定义重要性。

Result: OrthoRank在相同稀疏度下表现优于层剪枝方法，困惑度更低，零样本准确率更高。

Conclusion: OrthoRank是一种有效的动态token选择方法，适用于提升语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

capabilities and limitations in genre prediction remain unclear. This work
analyzes three Large Language Models (LLMs) using the MovieLens-100K dataset to
assess their genre prediction capabilities. Our findings show that ChatGPT,
without fine-tuning, outperformed other LLMs, and fine-tuned ChatGPT performed
best overall. We set up zero-shot and few-shot prompts using audio
transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset,
covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres.
Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize
a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This
fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In
conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction
capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further

### [407] [Losing our Tail -- Again: On (Un)Natural Selection And Multilingual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03933)
*Eva Vanmassenhove*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型（LLMs）改变了技术对语言的影响方式，但可能导致语言多样性丧失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型崩溃（model collapse）如何通过翻译技术导致语言形式、语法特征和文化细微差别的消失。

Method: 结合计算机视觉、自然语言处理（NLP）和机器翻译（MT）的最新研究，分析语言分布的尾部消失现象。

Result: 语言多样性正在减少，威胁到文化和身份的多样性。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新构想NLP领域，保护和鼓励多语言表达的多样性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从非结构化文本中提取结构化属性的问题，特别是在事件报告中识别人类属性。

Method: 结合词汇和语义相似性技术识别相关句子并提取属性。

Result: 在InciText数据集上验证了其有效性，无需监督训练即可实现属性提取。

Abstract: We propose POSID, a modular, lightweight and on-demand framework for
extracting structured attribute-based properties from unstructured text without
task-specific fine-tuning. While the method is designed to be adaptable across

incident reports. POSID combines lexical and semantic similarity techniques to
identify relevant sentences and extract attributes. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on a missing person use case using the InciText dataset,
achieving effective attribute extraction without supervised training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Easy Dataset是一个通过图形用户界面（GUI）从非结构化文档中合成微调数据的统一框架，解决了领域数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在通用任务上表现优异，但适应特定领域时因高质量领域数据稀缺而面临挑战。

Method: Easy Dataset通过GUI配置文本提取模型和分块策略，将原始文档转换为连贯文本块，并利用角色驱动提示方法生成多样化问答对。

Result: 实验表明，在金融问答任务中，使用合成数据集微调的LLMs显著提升了领域性能，同时保留了通用知识。

Conclusion: Easy Dataset为领域适应提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，代码开源并广受欢迎。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at
https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub
stars.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多文化环境中成为重要顾问，其文化敏感性和推理能力至关重要。

Method: 提出Nunchi-Bench基准，评估LLM在韩国文化背景下的表现，采用多语言（韩语和英语）测试，并提出新的评分策略。

Result: LLM在文化推理方面存在显著挑战，能识别事实信息但难以应用于实际场景；明确的文化框架比单纯依赖提示语言更有效。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench为文化推理研究提供了工具，并公开了基准和排行榜。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Conclusion: KOPL有效提升韩语OOV词处理能力，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce KOPL, a novel framework for handling Korean OOV
words with Phoneme representation Learning. Our work is based on the linguistic
property of Korean as a phonemic script, the high correlation between phonemes
and letters. KOPL incorporates phoneme and word representations for Korean OOV
words, facilitating Korean OOV word representations to capture both text and
phoneme information of words. We empirically demonstrate that KOPL
significantly improves the performance on Korean Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, while being readily integrated into existing static and contextual
Korean embedding models in a plug-and-play manner. Notably, we show that KOPL
outperforms the state-of-the-art model by an average of 1.9%. Our code is

Conclusion: LLMThinkBench为研究人员提供了一种经济高效的方法，用于诊断基础推理能力和效率分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
mathematical benchmarks, yet often struggle with simple arithmetic tasks and
exhibit a tendency toward over-explaining or "overthinking" answers. To
systematically assess this phenomenon, we introduce LLMThinkBench, a modular
benchmarking framework that enables researchers to evaluate basic math
reasoning and overthinking in LLMs. The framework provides 14 configurable math
tasks with randomized test data generation and robust parsing strategies.
Researchers can quantify overthinking using our Overthinking Score metric,

Abstract: Effective communication is essential in cancer care, yet patients often face
challenges in preparing for complex medical visits. We present an interactive,
Retrieval-augmented Generation-assisted system that helps patients progress
from uninformed to visit-ready. Our system adapts the Ottawa Personal Decision
Guide into a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation workflow, helping users
bridge knowledge gaps, clarify personal values and generate useful questions
for their upcoming visits. Focusing on localized prostate cancer, we conduct a
user study with patients and a clinical expert. Results show high system
usability (UMUX Mean = 6.0 out of 7), strong relevance of generated content
(Mean = 6.7 out of 7), minimal need for edits, and high clinical faithfulness
(Mean = 6.82 out of 7). This work demonstrates the potential of combining
patient-centered design with language models to enhance clinical preparation in
oncology care.

*Ting-Wen Ko,Jyun-Yu Jiang,Pu-Jen Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaPCR提出了一种新的检索增强生成框架，通过建模段落间的依赖关系，提升开放域问答的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法独立检索段落，导致冗余、噪声或多样性不足，尤其在噪声语料和多跳问题中表现不佳。

Method: AdaPCR将段落组合作为检索和重排单元，包括上下文感知的查询重构和基于下游答案可能性的重排步骤，自适应选择检索段落数量。

Result: 实验表明AdaPCR在多个QA基准测试中优于基线，尤其在多跳推理中表现突出。

Conclusion: 建模段落间依赖关系能有效提升检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手工构建语义地图方法效率低下，缺乏可视化与评估工具，XISM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用自上而下的方法，结合用户数据和算法生成候选语义地图，并提供编辑功能。

Result: XISM能够高效构建语义地图，支持多指标评估，并允许专家干预优化结果。

Conclusion: XISM结合了数据驱动效率和专家知识，适用于类型学语言学家和计算语言学家。

Abstract: Semantic map models represent meanings or functions as nodes in a graph
constrained by the local connectivity hypothesis, with edges indicating their
associations. Widely used in typological linguistics, these models compare
interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both
typologists and computational linguists. The system

### [416] [Conversation Forests: The Key to Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Turn Medical Conversations is Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04099)
*Thomas Savage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Savage Conversation Forests (SCF)的强化学习框架，用于优化大型语言模型在多轮对话任务中的表现，特别是在医疗诊断对话中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和GRPO在单轮任务中表现良好，但在多轮对话（如医疗诊断）中效果有限，因为需要理解早期对话对后续结果的影响。

Method: SCF采用分支对话架构，生成多种可能的对话延续，使模型学习早期回答如何影响后续交互和诊断结果。

Result: 在模拟医患对话的实验中，SCF在诊断准确性上优于线性对话架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化复杂多轮对话任务的重要策略，SCF通过提供更丰富的训练信号提升了模型表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

TL;DR: BYOKG-RAG框架通过结合LLM和专用图检索工具，提升了知识图谱问答的通用性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在自定义知识图谱上泛化能力不足和实体链接错误的问题。

Method: LLM生成关键图谱构件，图工具链接并检索图谱上下文，LLM迭代优化后生成最终答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，BYOKG-RAG优于次优方法4.5%，且对自定义图谱泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG为自定义知识图谱问答提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考、基于标记级概率方差的幻觉检测框架，适用于实时或事后分析，并在不同规模的自回归模型上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成任务中表现优异，但容易产生幻觉（事实错误的输出），需要一种无需参考的检测方法。

Method: 利用多个随机生成中标记级概率的方差，设计了一个模型无关、可解释的幻觉检测框架。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集的无答案问题上验证，标记级方差能可靠地指示模型输出的不稳定性，并与幻觉模式相关。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现且适用于多领域，为分析LLMs生成可靠性提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了提示结构和高效微调（LoRA）对临床自然语言推理（NLI）中大型语言模型（LLM）性能的影响，发现提示类型占性能差异的44%，LoRA微调显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床NLI中提示策略和微调技术的效果尚未充分探索，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用四类提示策略，结合LoRA微调，在NLI4CT基准上评估性能。

Result: 提示类型占性能差异的44%，LoRA微调提升8-12 F1，性能接近GPT-4o-mini。

Conclusion: 提示设计和轻量级微调可提升临床NLP系统的效率和可信度。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

Conclusion: PEFT框架在多文化名字识别中取得了显著进展，为实际应用提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

Motivation: 手动标注角色关系耗时且覆盖率低，而LLM输出常存在幻觉或逻辑不一致问题，需改进方法。

Method: 结合LLM提取与符号推理，构建可编辑的角色关系图，并通过七种逻辑约束优化。

Result: 实验显示SymbolicThought提高了标注准确性和一致性，同时显著降低时间成本。

Conclusion: SymbolicThought为叙事理解、可解释AI和LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: Context Tuning是一种无需微调模型参数即可显著提升语言模型少样本适应能力的方法，通过任务相关示例初始化可训练提示，优于传统提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示方法通常用无关标记初始化提示，限制了少样本学习效果，而Context Tuning利用任务相关示例提升性能。

Method: 通过任务相关示例初始化可训练提示或前缀，利用模型的上下文学习能力提取信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于传统提示方法，接近测试时训练的准确性且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且有效的少样本适应方法，优于传统提示技术。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在学术图书馆参考服务中表现出公平性和情境适应性，具备应用潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了东亚语言（中文、日文、韩文）在NLP数据集上的现状，揭示了不同语言社区的独特模式，并提出了改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管东亚语言使用者众多，但其NLP数据集资源分散且研究不足，亟需系统性分析。

Method: 通过定量和定性方法分析了HuggingFace上的3,300多个数据集，关注文化、研究环境和制度对数据集的影响。

Result: 发现中文数据集多为机构驱动，韩语数据集以社区为主，日语数据集则侧重娱乐和亚文化。

Conclusion: 提出了改进数据集文档、许可清晰度和跨语言资源共享的策略，以促进东亚LLM的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

Method: 从国家法规、社交平台政策和NLP研究数据集三个角度综合分析仇恨言论监管和策略。

Result: 发现仇恨言论定义和监管实践在司法管辖区和平台间存在显著不一致，且与研究努力缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 建议进一步探索统一框架，整合多种策略以实现自动化仇恨言论监管。

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在分析健康公共话语中的准确性和可行性，尤其是在检测不同健康情感方面的表现。

Method: 使用Facebook和Twitter数据，结合人工标注作为标准，评估三种LLM对HPV疫苗接种和加热烟草产品的健康情感分类准确性。

Result: 三种LLM在分类风险促进和健康支持情感上总体准确，但表现因平台、议题和模型类型不同；中性消息检测存在挑战。

Conclusion: 选择验证语言模型时需谨慎，考虑训练数据潜在偏差对结果的影响。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Conclusion: 长链推理结合自反思是提升泛化推理能力的有效方向，传统短链方法效果不佳。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Motivation: 宗教与灵性（R/S）是复杂且高度依赖上下文的概念，传统档案搜索方法难以操作化，导致提取相关信息需要大量时间和专业知识。

Method: 利用7,500份联合国（UN）关于R/S的决议文件，构建了一个轻量级的聊天式问答系统SpiritRAG，支持复杂、上下文敏感的数据库搜索。

Result: 通过100个手动编写的问题进行试点测试和专家评估，证明了SpiritRAG的实用性和价值。

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为解决R/S领域的信息提取难题提供了一种高效、易用的工具。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

Motivation: Transformer的软注意力机制在长上下文场景下存在计算瓶颈，现有方法如线性注意力或局部注意力未能完全解决问题。

Method: RAT将输入分块，块内使用线性循环捕获局部依赖，块间使用软注意力建模长程交互，并通过调整块大小灵活权衡效率与性能。

Conclusion: RAT及其混合设计在效率和性能上均优于传统注意力机制，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Method: 提出基于梯度保留压缩的GradOT方法，选择性应用秩压缩和通道剪枝技术，保留适配器梯度并确保隐私。

Result: 实验表明，GradOT在隐私保护和模型性能上优于现有方法，并提供理论支持。

Conclusion: GradOT为大规模LLMs的离线调优提供了实用且无需额外训练的理论基础。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 现有模型主要依赖浅层线索（如图像标题或对象属性）检测讽刺，难以捕捉更深层次的背景知识（如文化参考或常识推理）。

Method: MiDRE模型包含内部推理专家（检测图像-文本对的不一致性）和外部推理专家（利用大型视觉语言模型生成结构化推理链），并通过自适应门控机制动态权衡两者。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，MiDRE表现优于基线模型，外部推理链的引入显著提升了模型对讽刺的理解。

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内部和外部推理路径，有效解决了多模态讽刺检测中的深层背景知识问题，即使外部推理链偶尔存在噪声，仍能提供有价值的线索。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Motivation: 社交媒体的多模态内容广泛使用，但现有模型依赖大量标注数据，难以适应标注稀缺的现实场景，因此探索少样本设置下的讽刺检测问题。

Method: 提出DMDP框架，使用门控模态特定深度提示，注入多层级以实现分层特征学习，并结合提示共享机制和跨模态对齐模块。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上，DMDP在少样本和极低资源设置下表现优异，跨数据集评估显示其泛化能力强。

Conclusion: DMDP在多模态讽刺检测中表现出色，尤其在少样本和跨领域场景下优于基线方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本生成中展现出潜力，但现有的dLLMs在可控生成方面面临序列长度敏感性、高幻觉率和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出$S^3$框架，将目标模式结构注入输出上下文，以减少不必要的计算并提升可控性。

Result: 实验显示$S^3$显著提升了结构一致性（65%）、内容保真度（48%）并降低了幻觉率（17%）。

Conclusion: $S^3$为扩散模型在可控文本生成任务中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在资源受限环境下无法高效处理多模态讽刺检测的问题。

Method: 提出AdS框架，基于CLIP模型，仅在上层插入适配器，并引入文本适配器指导视觉适配器的共享机制。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS以更少的可训练参数达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AdS为低资源环境下的多模态讽刺检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保护上下文隐私时缺乏形式化保证或效用/隐私权衡不佳，DP-Fusion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将敏感令牌分组，对每组运行LLM，混合输出分布以控制隐私泄露。

Result: 通过参数ε调节隐私与效用，ε=0完全隐藏PII，较高值提升效用。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion提供了细粒度的隐私/效用控制，但需多次LLM前向传递。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及方言评估基准上表现优异，12B模型在拉丁字母任务上性能提升14.4%。

Conclusion: 该研究为双脚本语言的LLM适配提供了全面方法，资源已公开。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

*Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Nick Beauchamp,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PRIME框架，结合双记忆模型（情景记忆和语义记忆）实现LLM个性化，并引入慢思考策略增强个性化能力。实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM个性化方法缺乏统一理论框架，无法系统理解个性化效果的驱动因素。

Method: 将认知双记忆模型融入LLM个性化，情景记忆映射用户历史互动，语义记忆映射长期信念，并引入慢思考策略。

Result: PRIME在长短上下文场景中均表现有效，能捕捉动态个性化而非仅流行偏见。

Conclusion: PRIME为LLM个性化提供了统一框架，实验证明其有效性，并填补了长上下文个性化评估的空白。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

*Matteo Guida,Yulia Otmakhova,Eduard Hovy,Lea Frermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算框架，用于分析新闻文章和读者评论中的框架传递与重组，发现框架在评论中的重用高度相关，并发布了相关数据集和分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于填补NLP方法中忽略新闻框架与受众响应关系的空白，探索框架在新闻内容和读者评论中的传递与重组。

Method: 方法包括细化框架标签、构建从句子级预测重建主导框架的框架，并将新闻文章与相关评论对齐。

Result: 研究发现，评论中的框架重用在不同新闻媒体间高度相关，但主题特定模式存在差异。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的计算框架有效分析了框架传递，并提供了可用于未来研究的数据集和工具。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Conclusion: EI-BERT为边缘计算中的NLP任务提供了高效且紧凑的解决方案，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架R1-RE，通过模仿人类标注者的推理过程，显著提升了关系抽取任务在域外数据上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法在域外数据上表现不佳，受人类标注者工作流程启发，作者希望通过强化学习框架改进这一问题。

Method: 将关系抽取任务重新定义为基于标注指南的推理任务，并引入R1-RE框架，利用小语言模型的推理能力进行标注。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型的域外准确率达到约70%，与GPT-4o等领先专有模型相当。

Conclusion: R1-RE框架不仅提升了关系抽取的域外泛化能力，还揭示了强化学习在关系抽取任务中的训练动态和推理行为。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未探索电商评论中情感检测与解释性文本识别的联合任务，无法理解触发顾客情感的原因。

Method: 提出EOT联合任务，基于Plutchik的8种基本情感理论，引入标注数据集EOT-X，并开发框架EOT-DETECT。

Result: 评估了23种大型语言模型，EOT-DETECT框架在零样本和思维链技术上表现优异。

Conclusion: EOT任务和框架为理解电商评论中的情感触发机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across
e-commerce domains.

Result: LOOM-Scope能够全面且高效地评估长上下文模型的性能。

Conclusion: LOOM-Scope为长上下文模型评估提供了标准化和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context processing has become a fundamental capability for large
language models~(LLMs). To assess model's long-context performance, numerous
long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成查询聚焦的可解释比较摘要（QF-CES）的新任务，利用多源意见摘要（M-OS）方法，并通过引入MS-Q2P数据集和大型语言模型（LLMs）实现。该方法在减少延迟和评估效果上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏全面的比较视角，无法满足产品推荐的需求。

Method: 采用多源意见摘要（M-OS）作为中间步骤，利用LLMs生成表格形式的比较摘要，并引入MS-Q2P数据集。

Result: M-OS比直接输入方法（DIA）减少约40%的延迟；QF-CES-PROMPT评估显示与人类判断的Spearman相关性为0.74。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成和评估查询聚焦的可解释比较摘要方面具有潜力，尤其在延迟和评估效果上表现突出。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型（如Wav2vec 2.0）如何学习并表征不同语言中的单词重音，特别是比较可变重音语言与固定重音语言之间的差异。

Method: 在五种语言（荷兰语、英语、德语、匈牙利语和波兰语）上训练诊断性重音分类器，分析S3M嵌入的表征能力。

Result: 分类器能高精度区分重音和非重音音节；重音表征具有语言特异性，可变重音语言与固定重音语言间的差异更显著。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型能有效学习单词重音的表征，且这些表征因语言类型而异。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犹太-阿拉伯语转写为阿拉伯文字存在挑战，如字母映射模糊、拼写不一致和频繁的语码转换，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两步法：先进行简单的字符级映射，再进行后校正以解决语法和拼写错误。

Result: 首次对LLMs在此任务上的表现进行了基准评估，并证明转写后阿拉伯NLP工具可进行形态句法标注和机器翻译。

Conclusion: 该方法为犹太-阿拉伯语文本的NLP处理提供了可行性，扩展了阿拉伯NLP工具的应用范围。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏对产品元数据的整合，且缺乏评估数据集，阻碍了多源意见摘要的发展。

Method: 引入M-OS-EVAL数据集，评估多源意见摘要的7个维度，并利用LLMs生成摘要。

Result: M-OS显著提升用户参与度，87%用户偏好M-OS摘要，且M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断相关性更高（ρ=0.74）。

Conclusion: 多源意见摘要结合元数据能有效提升摘要质量和用户参与度，M-OS-EVAL为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在资源受限的个人设备上实现实时个性化，云端模型缺乏本地用户信息，本地模型生成质量不足。

Method: 利用本地小模型的上下文感知与无关输出的logits差异作为引导信号，动态调整云端大模型的logits，实现隐私保护的个性化生成。

Result: 实验表明，CoSteer能有效生成个性化内容，保护隐私且计算开销可接受。

Conclusion: CoSteer通过协作框架平衡了生成质量与隐私保护，为个性化文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Motivation: 理解语言模型在记忆标签噪声时为何仍能保持推理能力。

Method: 使用两个可控的合成推理数据集（FDA和THR）分析模型记忆标签噪声的机制。

Result: 模型通过分布式编码和异常启发式记忆标签噪声，且记忆依赖于推理机制。

Conclusion: 标签噪声的记忆建立在推理机制之上，而非覆盖它们，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统在低资源场景下因标注数据不足而性能受限的问题。

Method: Spec-TOD框架结合了任务指令的端到端设计，并利用轻量级LLM进行高效训练。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上，Spec-TOD取得了竞争性结果，同时大幅减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD展示了在低资源场景下高效训练任务导向对话系统的潜力。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

Motivation: 现实应用中，领域特定的OR-CONVQA训练数据难以获取，但组织内存在大量文本文档，可用于自动生成训练数据。

Method: 提出一个流程，利用文本文档自动生成带标注的OR-CONVQA对话，包括问题-答案对、去语境化问题和基于文档的命题。

Result: 生成的合成对话可用于训练问题重写器，提升检索效率，并结合LLM生成系统响应。

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA提供了一种高效的数据生成和训练方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中语义表示的位置，以促进模型的可解释性和架构创新。

Method: 构建Transformer模型，嵌入层完全冻结，使用视觉结构的Unicode字形生成非语义嵌入。

Result: 模型在MMLU推理基准上优于传统可训练嵌入模型，表明语义是架构和数据的涌现属性。

Conclusion: 输入嵌入层的作用应从语义容器重新定义为结构基元。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注算法正确性，忽视了视觉保真度和交互完整性，阻碍了LLM在生成动态视觉内容方面的发展。

Method: 提出ArtifactsBench框架，通过程序化渲染生成物并捕捉其动态行为，利用多模态LLM（MLLM）结合细粒度任务清单进行评分。

Result: 评估30多个领先LLM，自动化评估与人类偏好（WebDev Arena）排名一致性达94.4%，与专家评估一致性超90%。

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个能可靠自动化评估人类感知质量的框架，开源以推动用户中心生成模型的发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Result: 用户研究和分析证明Co-DETECT能有效识别边缘案例并提升标注规则的质量。

Conclusion: Co-DETECT通过混合主动标注框架显著提升了文本分类中边缘案例的处理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models
(LLMs). Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset
provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and
quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Conclusion: 研究为不同LLMs在不同任务类型中的行为提供了实用见解，推动了基于指令的高效NLP系统研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Result: 在真实数据集上，SMART优于其他难度预测方法。

Conclusion: SMART通过改进的能力对齐，为题目难度预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最强大的共情LSLM模型多为封闭系统，缺乏透明性，阻碍了研究进展。OpenS2S旨在填补这一空白，推动共情语音系统的透明研究。

Method: 基于BLSP-Emo模型，采用流式交错解码架构实现低延迟语音生成，并利用自动化数据构建流程合成多样化的共情语音对话数据。

Result: OpenS2S成功构建了一个可扩展的训练语料库，并开源了模型、数据集及代码，为研究社区提供了资源。

Conclusion: OpenS2S为共情语音系统的研究提供了透明、开源的解决方案，有望加速该领域的创新。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合直接偏好优化（DPO）和课程学习的新框架，用于生成可靠且符合人类推理的新闻解释，特别针对低资源语言如印地语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等低资源语言提供可靠的新闻解释工具至关重要，但目前缺乏自动化工具。

Method: 通过整合DPO和课程学习，利用可信来源的事实核查解释作为首选响应，LLM输出作为非首选响应，并引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化DPO损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（如Mistral、Llama、mBART等）。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至低资源语言，有效应对错误信息并提升解释生成质量。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种新颖的奖励建模方法，通过将奖励建模视为策略判别器，显著提升了奖励模型的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，POLAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出POLAR方法，训练奖励模型以区分相同和不同的策略，捕捉策略间的相对差异。

Result: POLAR显著提升性能，如STEM任务准确率从54.8%提升至81.0%，并在RLHF中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR为开发通用且强大的奖励模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的上下文启动漏洞，并提出了一种名为“响应攻击”的方法，利用辅助LLM生成有害内容，从而诱导目标模型违规。该方法在多个LLMs中表现优于现有技术，并提出了缓解措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中未被探索的上下文启动漏洞，揭示其可能被滥用于生成违规内容的潜在风险。

Method: 提出“响应攻击”（Response Attack），通过辅助LLM生成有害响应并格式化对话，诱导目标模型生成违规内容。

Result: 在八个开源和专有LLMs中，该方法攻击成功率显著高于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过构建上下文感知的安全微调数据集，有效降低了攻击成功率，同时保留了模型能力。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注推理、规划和执行能力，而记忆能力的评估不足，缺乏系统性。

Method: 结合现有数据集和新构建的数据集，设计MemoryAgentBench，评估多种记忆代理。

Result: 当前方法在四个核心能力上表现不足，显示需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench为LLM代理的记忆能力提供了系统评估工具，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

Motivation: 传统交通网络建模方法孤立发展，缺乏统一框架，难以实现实时控制和多模式协调。

Method: 引入FTT架构，将起点-终点流、路径概率和链路旅行时间作为互联张量，支持梯度优化和张量分解。

Result: FTT实现了实时控制策略、多模式高效协调，并严格满足物理网络约束。

Conclusion: FTT填补了理论模型与实际部署之间的差距，为下一代综合交通系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration
of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement
learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have
traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through
Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin
destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected
tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a
consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization
across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports
multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups
with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor
decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large
scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control
strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and
operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT
framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and
practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation
integrated mobility systems.

Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing
rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes
industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control
devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic
implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a
stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level
Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level
physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their
sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the
system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization
scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at
the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic
integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL --
presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading
to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability
pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box
operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work
presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization
framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working
mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under
the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to
understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what
role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to
address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a
handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a
promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the
results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a
model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large
context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per
query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the
experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim
was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do
mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do
mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject
matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a
large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further
use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first
PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a
conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented
philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for
such work.

Motivation: 湍流模拟的稳态统计量优化在工程中有广泛应用，但现有方法因混沌性导致梯度发散而难以扩展。

Method: 开发了在线梯度流方法，结合在线梯度估计和有限差分估计，避免梯度发散。

Result: 在多个混沌方程（如Lorenz-63、Kuramoto-Sivashinsky和Navier-Stokes）中，OGF方法显著降低了损失并准确恢复最优参数。

Conclusion: OGF方法为高自由度混沌系统的稳态统计量优化提供了可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution
converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest
typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t}
\int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow
\infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the
Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x;
\theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization,
flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as
existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically
representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the
chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method
diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large
degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state
statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method
forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while
simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key
feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster
optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to
avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is
demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial
differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky
equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous
isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the
loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately
recovers the optimal parameters.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮、重叠或堆叠关系错位，难以平衡语义保真度和物理合理性。

Method: AutoLayout采用双系统框架：慢速系统通过RRG管道提取物体属性和空间约束；快速系统生成离散坐标和拓扑关系集，并通过LLM的ARL进行验证。

Result: 在8种场景中，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性上比SOTA方法提升了10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢-快协作推理和自验证机制，有效解决了布局生成中的问题，实现了物理稳定性和语义一致性的平衡。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Motivation: 传统导线排列设计依赖经验，复杂结构下难以实现，且现有研究常过度简化问题（如限制为2D平面或忽略导线交叉）。

Method: 采用多目标黑盒优化方法，优化三维连杆结构的导线排列，确保导线不交叉且满足目标轨迹的关节扭矩需求。

Result: 在不同条件下优化导线排列，验证了方法的有效性，并讨论了设计解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂结构下的导线排列设计提供了实用且高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同域之间的代理交互和环境特征差异，传统方法在利用多源数据集时存在域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本等问题。

Method: IMMP采用两步流程：预合并以捕获代理行为和交互，充分提取源域信息；合并以构建可适应模型，高效转移交互到目标域。

Result: 在多个规划基准和模型上评估，IMMP表现出优于传统方法的性能。

Conclusion: IMMP通过有效合并域信息，解决了运动规划中的域适应挑战，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Conclusion: EmbodieDreamer有效减少Real2Sim2Real差距，提升机器人策略在真实世界中的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Conclusion: StreamVLN通过慢-快设计实现了高效的多模态推理，适用于长视频流和实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,
yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied.
This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset
transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in
multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4
Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the
US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset
experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred
between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型在模拟极端气候事件（如热浪和寒潮）中的能力，尤其是在训练范围外的表现。

Method: 比较两种深度学习模型（NGCM和DLESyM）与传统高分辨率模型（HiRAM）在1900-1960年间的模拟结果。

Result: 两种深度学习模型在未见过的气候条件下表现良好，但在北美和北亚部分区域表现不佳。DLESyM因温度自相关性高估了极端事件频率，而NGCM表现更接近HiRAM。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在模拟极端气候事件方面具有潜力，但需进一步优化以减少区域偏差和自相关性影响。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as
fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their
training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid
Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning
Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution
land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All
models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over
1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960).
Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly
reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events
during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions
of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during
1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends
to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL
hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

Result: 实验表明，LLM-SAEA在标准测试案例中优于多种先进算法。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA通过LLMs实现了高效的动态配置，提升了SAEAs的性能。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds

recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic

Result: 实验表明SPEAR能有效在特定SynOps约束下压缩SNN。

Conclusion: SPEAR为资源受限的神经形态硬件部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Result: HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余脉冲，在静态和神经形态数据集上达到SOTA准确率，抗噪能力优于传统SNN和ANN。

Conclusion: HDRP机制在提升低延迟SNN性能和抗噪能力中起关键作用。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms
automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery
methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework
with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation
heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA
variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and
analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration,
exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse
these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis
combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features,
performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks.
The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm
structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both
a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist
evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over
the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that
higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and
faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how
behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics
outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the
open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide
insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm
generators.

biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

### [499] [Lightweight LSTM Model for Energy Theft Detection via Input Data Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02872)

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种双曲核图融合（HKGF）框架，用于多模态神经影像分析，以捕捉脑网络的层次结构，并在神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，无法有效捕捉脑网络的层次结构。HKGF旨在通过双曲空间表示和融合多模态数据，更好地分析神经认知衰退。

Method: HKGF框架包括多模态图构建模块、双曲核图神经网络（HKGNNs）学习模块、跨模态耦合模块和下游预测的双曲神经网络。HKGNNs在双曲空间中表示图，以捕捉脑区域的局部和全局依赖关系。

Result: 在超过4,000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在两种神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，能够客观量化与神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

TL;DR: CP-DRL是一种基于因果关系的课程强化学习框架，通过任务间因果差异和可学习性优化任务序列设计，显著提升了样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键，但现有方法依赖真实因果结构，不切实际。CP-DRL旨在通过交互数据近似因果差异，解决这一问题。

Method: CP-DRL结合任务新颖性（基于因果差异）和可学习性（基于奖励增益），形成统一目标，优化任务序列。

Result: 在Point Mass基准测试中，CP-DRL收敛更快且回报更高；在Bipedal Walker-Trivial中方差更低；在Infeasible变体中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率，CP-DRL为这一方向提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Method: 利用HuBERT的自蒸馏机制，直接替换原始模型，无需额外模块或架构约束。

Result: 在SUPERB基准上，DiceHuBERT在音素识别和ASR任务上分别提升21%和14%，并在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT是一种高效的知识蒸馏方法，显著优于现有方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多因素问题中的结构复杂性和多重共线性，特别是在碳排放分析中，提供一种客观的特征聚类和特征选择方法。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督学习以聚类特征，结合Elastic Net回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业的能源消耗数据（2000-2019），识别出16个类别，并定量评估了排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于分析复杂的区域挑战（如碳排放），并指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Motivation: BNN在安全关键应用中具有潜力，但现有分析方法存在可扩展性不足或可信度问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 开发了定制求解器和近似模型计数器，支持BNN约束的原生表示，并设计了专门的证明生成和检查流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为BNN的可靠验证提供了高效且可信的解决方案，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

### [505] [Echo State Transformer: When chaos brings memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917)
*Yannis Bendi-Ouis,Xavier Hinaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Echo State Transformers (EST)的混合架构，结合Transformer注意力机制和储层计算原理，解决了序列处理中的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在大规模语言处理中效率高，但与大脑认知任务处理方式不符，且序列处理的二次复杂度限制了其应用。

Method: EST结合Transformer注意力机制和储层计算，引入并行工作的随机循环网络作为独立记忆单元，动态调整储层参数。

Result: 在STREAM基准测试的12项任务中，EST在8项任务中优于GRUs、LSTMs和标准Transformers。

Conclusion: EST是GRUs和LSTMs的有效替代方案，尤其在资源受限和低数据场景下，能补充标准Transformer的不足。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems.
While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to
reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial
granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures
place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM
condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and
OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of
places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data
pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale
geospatial analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子预训练模型虽准确度高，但缺乏专家推理能力，MolProphecy旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用ChatGPT生成化学家知识，通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子图特征融合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于SOTA模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy提供了一种灵活且可推广的药物发现协作方法，支持真实化学家输入而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Result: 该方法能有效回答从简单图到蛋白质和超图的问题，且无需调整架构。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著简化了现有解决方案，并能轻松泛化到多种图结构。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上，MSE和MAE分别降低了81.3%和52.3%。

Conclusion: SDKD框架能有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,

GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive

framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: 使用LSTM网络预测五个城市的酒店KPIs，结果显示曼彻斯特和孟买预测准确率最高，迪拜和曼谷因季节性因素波动较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LSTM模型在城市酒店关键绩效指标（KPIs）预测中的有效性，并为全球城市的旅游和规划提供数据支持。

Method: 采用LSTM网络，结合时间序列分解和机器学习技术，使用2018-2025年的月度数据，80%训练，20%测试。

Result: 曼彻斯特和孟买预测准确率最高，迪拜和曼谷因季节性因素波动较大。

Conclusion: LSTM模型在城市酒店预测中有效，具有全球适用性，对旅游和城市规划有潜在价值。

Abstract: This study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast key
performance indicators (KPIs), Occupancy (OCC), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and
Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), across five major cities: Manchester,
Amsterdam, Dubai, Bangkok, and Mumbai. The cities were selected for their
diverse economic profiles and hospitality dynamics. Monthly data from 2018 to
2025 were used, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Advanced time series
decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and
trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the
highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and
Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven
influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban
hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven
decision-making. The models generalisability across global cities highlights
its potential utility for tourism stakeholders and urban planners.

TL;DR: 论文证明了通用逼近定理（UAT）系统对齐的基本数学限制，指出灾难性失败是任何有用计算系统不可避免的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用逼近器的表达能力与灾难性不稳定性之间的不可分割联系，揭示完美可靠控制的数学不可能性。

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和经验必要性三个层面的论证，证明任何通用逼近器架构都无法避免灾难性失败。

Result: 研究结果表明，完美对齐不是工程挑战，而是数学上的不可能，并提出了“不可能三明治”定量分析。

Conclusion: 论文将UAT安全性问题从“如何实现完美控制”重新定义为“如何在不可约不可控性下安全操作”，对UAT开发和治理具有深远影响。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvisibleInk是一个可扩展的长文本生成框架，通过差分隐私保护敏感信息，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM生成长文本时，如何安全地整合私有信息仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有令牌的小超集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 实验表明，计算成本降低8倍，生成的长文本质量与基线相当。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能以低于非私有生成10倍的计算成本生成长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据保护方法在生成式AI时代已不足，需重新定义保护范围并加强执行。

Method: 提出四层分类法，分析每层的技术方法并揭示监管盲点。

Result: 框架为开发者、研究者和监管者提供了数据保护与效用权衡的结构化视角。

Conclusion: 需重新思考现代AI技术中的数据保护，并提供及时指导。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于弱监督和Transformer的混合框架，结合少量金标准标签和大量银标准标签，用于罕见疾病的表型分类和预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病因低患病率和临床医生不熟悉而难以诊断，现有计算表型算法受限于标签数据稀缺和偏差。

Method: 采用弱监督的Transformer框架，结合金标准和银标准标签，通过医学概念嵌入和多层Transformer架构训练模型。

Result: 在罕见肺部疾病案例中，模型在表型分类、患者聚类和疾病进展预测方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展罕见疾病患者的识别和分层，适用于临床护理和研究。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

*Jialiang Wang,Junzhou Wang,Xin Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应立方正则化的二阶潜在因子分析（ACRSLF）模型，用于高效处理高维不完整数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整（HDI）数据在现实应用中广泛存在，但现有二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性导致优化不稳定，需引入阻尼项和参数调优。

Method: ACRSLF采用自调谐立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，动态缓解非凸优化不稳定性并精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在两个工业HDI数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF收敛更快且表示精度高于现有基于优化器的LFA模型。

Conclusion: ACRSLF通过自适应立方正则化和精确二阶信息处理，显著提升了HDI数据的建模效率和准确性。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

TL;DR: Optimas是一个统一框架，用于优化复合AI系统，通过局部奖励函数（LRF）实现组件独立优化，同时确保局部改进提升全局性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合AI系统（如LLM、专用工具和传统ML模型）的优化因非可微结构和多样化配置而具有挑战性。

Method: Optimas为每个组件维护一个局部奖励函数（LRF），满足局部-全局对齐属性，并在迭代中适配LRF以最大化局部奖励。

Result: 在五个实际复合系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas提供了一种通用且有效的方法来优化复合系统。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Result: 优化方法存在灾难性遗忘和过拟合等固有缺陷，世界建模方法能避免这些问题。

Conclusion: AI领域需超越机器学习，探索其他方法以实现真正的人工认知。

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，在保持性能的同时超越性能阈值，比2:4稀疏更灵活且存储开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模增长，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏）因灵活性不足和对异常权重的敏感性而表现不佳。

Method: 研究了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，并应用稀疏结构化模式处理显著权重，同时采用方差校正和SmoothQuant类权重均衡技术提升稀疏模型性能。

Result: 8:16稀疏方法在性能上超越阈值，比2:4稀疏更灵活且存储开销更小（0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element）。结构化稀疏方法对异常权重的处理与非结构化方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏方法在性能和灵活性上优于传统稀疏方法，结合简单技术可进一步提升稀疏模型表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐机制的脆弱性，并指出需要开发更鲁棒的微调策略以保持模型行为的预期一致性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细连续的移动轨迹，为人类移动模式提供更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing

TL;DR: LLMs表现出矛盾行为：初始回答过度自信，被质疑时又过度怀疑。研究发现其存在选择支持性偏见和不一致建议的过度重视，偏离贝叶斯更新规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在自信与怀疑之间的矛盾行为，揭示其决策机制。

Method: 开发新实验范式，利用LLMs获取无记忆干扰的置信度估计，测试模型（Gemma 3、GPT4o等）的选择支持性偏见和不一致建议处理方式。

Result: LLMs表现出强烈的选择支持性偏见，对不一致建议过度敏感，偏离贝叶斯规范。

Conclusion: LLMs的自信机制由维持一致性和对矛盾反馈的过度敏感共同解释，揭示了其固执与易受批评的根源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

TL;DR: DOTResize是一种基于离散最优传输理论的Transformer压缩方法，通过合并相似神经元减少模型宽度，优于现有剪枝技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少大型预训练模型的成本和不可访问性，同时保持性能，针对神经元级冗余进行压缩。

Method: 将神经元宽度减少问题建模为离散最优传输问题，结合熵正则化和矩阵分解，重新投影整个神经元宽度。

Result: DOTResize在多个LLM家族和规模上优于现有剪枝技术，显著降低实际计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize提供了一种有效的模型压缩方法，能够在减少计算成本的同时保持性能。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路由模型在神经网络中基于神经元信号选择架构，但缺乏对共享信号的抑制机制，导致效率不足。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制数据统计中共享信号，使路由模型能针对每个数据样本选择专用路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升通用任务性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型中未被充分研究的方法，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升大语言模型的科学推理能力提供了挑战性诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP)的方法，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）在交互式问答任务中的查询策略，通过利用一致性预测集来更准确地估计不确定性，从而减少查询次数并提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的信息追求（IP）方法在LLM中难以准确估计互信息或条件熵，导致查询选择不优和预测性能下降。因此，需要一种更稳健的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 提出C-IP方法，利用一致性预测集与条件熵之间的关系，通过预测集的平均大小来估计不确定性，替代传统的条件熵方法。

Result: 在20 Questions任务中，C-IP表现出更好的预测性能和更短的查询链；在医疗问答数据集MediQ上，C-IP与单轮预测性能相当，同时提供更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布无关且稳健的不确定性估计方法，能够显著提升LLM在交互式问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

*Guangyan Li,Yongqiang Tang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多粒度自适应参数分配方法（MGAA），用于大语言模型（LLM）的低秩近似压缩，解决了传统方法中统一压缩比的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵采用统一压缩比，忽略了其对模型性能的差异化影响，且启发式搜索策略效率低、泛化能力差。

Method: MGAA方法通过两个组件实现自适应参数分配：1）基于子层输入输出余弦相似度分配压缩比；2）基于权重矩阵能量分布特性分配压缩比。

Result: 在多个LLM主干模型和基准数据集上的评估表明MGAA性能优越，且在多模态模型LLaVA上表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: MGAA方法能够自适应地分配参数，显著提升压缩效率和模型性能。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不规则采样时间序列中的因果发现问题，因传统方法无法处理多尺度交互和缺失数据，神经方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出ReTimeCausal，结合ANM和EM，通过核化稀疏回归和结构约束，迭代优化缺失值和因果图。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，ReTimeCausal在挑战性条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal有效解决了不规则采样和缺失数据问题，为因果发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Conclusion: 世界模型的核心目标是模拟现实世界的可行动可能性，新架构为实现这一目标提供了可能。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的摘要对语言模型仍具挑战性，现有方法如微调资源消耗大，而提示工程难以保持主题聚焦。

Method: 提出三种logits重新加权技术：常量偏移（Constant Shift）、因子缩放（Factor Scaling）和阈值选择（Threshold Selection）。

Result: 在NEWTS数据集上的实验表明，这些技术能有效增加主题相关词汇的使用，其中阈值选择方法在不影响摘要质量的情况下提升了主题聚焦。

Conclusion: 直接重新加权logits是一种资源高效且实用的替代微调方法，为精确控制生成文本的主题内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and

to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular
representation learning.

Result: 实验证明MAFG能有效自动化特征生成并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MAFG为科学数据特征生成提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

### [545] [Predicting Business Angel Early-Stage Decision Making Using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03721)
*Yan Katcharovski,Andrew L. Maxwell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用AI模型克服Critical Factor Assessment (CFA)工具的限制，通过训练大型语言模型(LLMs)和机器学习分类模型，成功提高了对初创企业融资决策的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期科技初创企业依赖外部资金，但天使投资人的决策过程主观且资源密集。CFA工具虽准确但耗时，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 研究使用LLMs为600份初创企业融资演讲分配CFA因素，并训练机器学习模型，以LLM生成的CFA分数为输入特征。

Result: 最佳模型预测天使投资决策的准确率达85.0%，与传统人工评估显著相关（Spearman's r = 0.896）。

Conclusion: AI与结构化决策框架结合，提供了一种可扩展、可靠且减少偏见的初创企业评估方法，解决了CFA工具的限制。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

detachment control with the DIII-D lower divertor camera. Using D2 gas, we
demonstrate feedback divertor detachment control with a mean absolute
difference of 2% from the target for both detachment and reattachment. This
automatic training and linear processing framework can be extended to any image
based diagnostic for regulatory compliant controller necessary for future
fusion reactors.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,

hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to
generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度集成框架的机器学习方法，用于减少PDE系统中自回归推断的误差累积，并在多个物理系统中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，机器学习替代模型在长期预测中因误差累积而准确性下降，需要一种更稳健的方法。

Method: 采用深度集成框架，训练多个随机初始化的ML替代模型，并在推断时聚合预测结果以减少误差传播。

Result: 在三种PDE驱动的动态系统中验证，显著减少了误差累积，且推断时间远快于传统数值求解器。

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在多样物理系统中表现出高效性和准确性，是传统求解器的潜在替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Result: 该方法显著提升了在线策略学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和LLM的RL方法在健康行为干预中具有潜力。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面临从未见过的动态系统，且测量数据稀疏、噪声大，需要一种无需模型的方法来重建动态。

Method: 结合神经隐式表示和DMD，利用神经网络的表达能力捕捉复杂空间结构，DMD的线性动态模态提供训练引导和低维表示。

Result: 在北美近地表风场和银河系中心黑洞附近等离子体演化任务中，NeuralDMD表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文学等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

Motivation: 解决AI与人类视觉在形状依赖、抗干扰和对抗攻击等方面的显著差异。

Method: 从人类视觉发展过程中汲取灵感，设计了一种发展性视觉训练方法（DVD）。

Result: DVD方法在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优于传统大规模训练模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化学习方式而非增加数据量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种无法治愈的神经退行性疾病，早期检测对延缓病情进展至关重要。本研究旨在通过患者历史访问数据预测病情进展阶段。

Method: 使用Transformer模型预测AD患者的下一次临床访问阶段，并与多种RNN模型（LSTM、GRU、minimalRNN）进行比较，评估不同特征类别和访问历史的重要性。

Result: 模型在数据缺失和不平衡的情况下表现出色，尤其在识别病情恶化的患者方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该模型在早期诊断和改善患者预后方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential
for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature
directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops

Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent
temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal
temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the
thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical

Motivation: SAM在训练中通过损失景观几何提升泛化能力，但面临噪声数据和隐私问题。现有数据影响评估工具（如IF）无法直接应用于SAM的双层计算结构。

Method: 开发了两种数据评估方法：基于Hessian的IF（仅依赖训练模型权重）和基于梯度轨迹的IF（利用训练中的梯度信息）。

Result: 实验证明两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了高效且准确的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and

depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD实现了新的SOTA性能，首次在10M环境步数内超越人类专家表现，并解锁所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD是一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体的性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: CAPIMAC能有效提升多模态数据融合质量，代码已公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

Abstract: This paper presents HERO (Hierarchical Testing with Rabbit Optimization), a
novel black-box adversarial testing framework for evaluating the robustness of
deep learning-based Prognostics and Health Management systems in Industrial
Cyber-Physical Systems. Leveraging Artificial Rabbit Optimization, HERO
generates physically constrained adversarial examples that align with
real-world data distributions via global and local perspective. Its
generalizability ensures applicability across diverse ICPS scenarios. This
study specifically focuses on the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system,
chosen for its highly dynamic operational conditions, complex degradation
mechanisms, and increasing integration into ICPS as a sustainable and efficient

vulnerabilities in even state-of-the-art PHM models, underscoring the critical
need for enhanced robustness in real-world applications. By addressing these
challenges, HERO demonstrates its potential to advance more resilient PHM
systems across a wide range of ICPS domains.

### [561] [When Data-Free Knowledge Distillation Meets Non-Transferable Teacher: Escaping Out-of-Distribution Trap is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04119)
*Ziming Hong,Runnan Chen,Zengmao Wang,Bo Han,Bo Du,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ATEsc的方法，用于在数据自由知识蒸馏（DFKD）中抵御不可信教师（NTL）的误导，通过识别和过滤OOD样本来提升知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但忽略了不可信教师（NTL）可能通过误导生成器转移OOD知识而非ID知识的问题。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，利用NTL教师对OOD样本更强的对抗鲁棒性，将合成样本分为脆弱组（ID-like）和鲁棒组（OOD-like），分别用于正常知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD在NTL教师下的性能。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD在不可信教师场景下提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

TL;DR: 提出一种非自回归框架，通过学习排列直接生成旅行商问题的解，无需显式搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中需要显式搜索和序列决策的问题，利用问题的内在结构指导组合优化。

Method: 通过相似变换处理哈密顿循环，利用连续松弛近似排列矩阵。

Result: 在无监督条件下，性能与经典启发式方法相当。

Conclusion: 表明组合优化可通过问题结构直接指导，无需序列决策。

Abstract: We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem
where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations without explicit
search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the
model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations.
Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical
heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can
effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential
decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Tsetlin机器（TM）的概率评分和不确定性量化技术，以增强模型的解释性。通过模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集的应用，验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升Tsetlin机器的解释性，通过概率评分和不确定性量化技术，使其预测更透明且可解释。

Method: 分析TM学习动态，推导出概率评分，并通过模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集验证不确定性量化技术。

Result: TM概率评分与数据基础概率相关，且在训练数据域外预测时信心较低，与神经网络的外推现象形成对比。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化技术为TM模型提供了新见解，并可能改进现有图像分类模型。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的Retformer模型，用于通过视网膜影像检测阿尔茨海默病（AD），并结合可解释AI技术提供决策依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病缺乏有效治疗方法，早期诊断对延缓疾病进展至关重要。视网膜影像作为一种非侵入性检测手段具有潜力。

Method: 使用多模态视网膜影像数据集训练Retformer模型，结合Grad-CAM算法可视化特征重要性。

Result: Retformer在多种性能指标上优于基准算法，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: Retformer为AD早期诊断提供了一种高效且可解释的方法，视网膜影像特征与AD诊断密切相关。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法通过优化敏感数据可能强化其暴露，违背最小化使用原则。

Method: 利用生成模型自身生成导致分布崩溃的特性，部分触发崩溃以遗忘敏感数据。

Result: 理论证明PMC收敛于遗忘目标，实验显示其更有效移除隐私信息。

Conclusion: PMC为符合现实隐私约束的全面遗忘提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）的自监督学习任务忽视了农业景观的独特时间特性（如自然周期），因此提出针对性的任务以填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三种农业特定的自监督学习任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF）。

Result: 在SICKLE数据集上，FF在作物测绘任务中达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；在印度全国尺度上，FF在FTW India数据集上达到54.2% IoU。

Conclusion: 提出的农业特定自监督学习任务显著优于现有基线方法，验证了其在农业遥感任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Motivation: 设计靶向特异性环肽因训练数据有限而未被充分探索，CP-Composer旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将复杂环化模式分解为单位约束，通过几何条件引入扩散模型，训练时学习线性肽的约束组合，推理时输入新约束。

Result: 模型能生成多样化的靶向结合环肽，不同环化策略的成功率为38%至84%。

Conclusion: CP-Composer展示了从线性肽训练数据生成环肽的潜力，为靶向药物设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer处理长序列成本过高，而次二次架构成本过低，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核以避免内存和带宽瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种高效且灵活的长序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在安全对齐中因过度拒绝良性提示而影响用户体验和模型效用的问题。

Method: 利用多样查询的内部激活模式，精确识别并调整触发拒绝的激活组件，仅微调单一模型层。

Result: 在多个基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力和模型整体效用。

Conclusion: ACTOR提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，优化LLMs的拒绝机制，提升用户体验。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Motivation: 扩散模型在数据集蒸馏任务中表现良好，但在低IPC（每类图像数）设置下生成的样本缺乏多样性。

Method: 从信息论角度出发，识别并最大化原型信息（I(X;Y)）和上下文信息（H(X|Y)），提出IGDS方法，通过变分估计实现。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上的实验表明，IGDS在所有IPC设置下均显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC情况下。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论指导的采样方法，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能，尤其在低IPC场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS方法在真实部署中面临适应性差、搜索成本高和性能不一致的问题，需要一种更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Method: DANCE将架构搜索重新定义为连续演化问题，引入连续架构分布、统一架构空间和多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上均优于现有NAS方法，且能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE通过连续演化和多阶段优化，显著提升了神经网络架构搜索的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多领域表现优异，但幻觉问题限制了其可信度和应用潜力。现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理，增加了推理时间。

Method: 提出SEED方法，通过识别、隔离和净化模型内部知识的幻觉，并将净化后的知识蒸馏回模型，实现自进化。同时提出Mode-Seeking Evolving方法和Hallucination Elimination Adapter。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SEED的优越性，显著减少了LLaVA-1.5和InternVL2等模型的幻觉问题。LLaVA-1.5的POPE-Random F1分数从81.3提升至88.3。

Conclusion: SEED方法有效减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能，且不增加额外推理时间。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合了FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，解决了KANs的高计算成本和性能问题。在函数回归任务中表现优异，但在图像和文本分类中需调整基函数数量以避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs因其可学习的单变量函数而受到关注，但存在高计算成本和分类任务性能不足的问题。MJKAN旨在克服这些限制。

Method: MJKAN整合了FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构，结合了KANs的非线性表达能力和MLPs的效率。

Result: 在函数回归任务中表现优于MLPs，但在图像和文本分类中需调整基函数数量以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KANs的理论优势，同时提高了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Motivation: 实际应用中，数据点标注成本差异和预算限制阻碍了主动学习策略的采用。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ConBatch-BAL策略减少了迭代次数和成本，甚至优于无约束基线。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在预算和成本约束下有效，适用于标注成本高的场景。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Motivation: 概率电路（PCs）在表示学习中未充分探索，现有方法依赖外部神经嵌入或激活编码。

Method: APCs通过联合建模数据和嵌入，利用可处理的概率推理获取嵌入表示，并与神经解码器集成。

Result: APCs在重建质量、嵌入生成和缺失数据处理上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APCs是一种强大灵活的表示学习方法，展示了在鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏中的潜力。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Result: 成功提取密码、邮箱地址和账号等PII，证明小型LLMs也存在隐私漏洞。

Conclusion: 需加强隐私保护技术，如差分隐私和数据清理，并进一步研究隐私保护机器学习方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their ability to memorize training data poses significant privacy risks.
This paper investigates model inversion attacks on the Llama 3.2 model, a
multilingual LLM developed by Meta. By querying the model with carefully

findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks
and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation
strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for
further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.

Conclusion: 结论指出，该研究为LLM-based RAG系统提供了可靠且经济高效的归因技术，填补了强大归因方法与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在领域专业化任务中计算效率低且性能不佳，需改进。

Method: LoSiA通过梯度稀疏分析动态定位关键子网络并优化，减少额外矩阵乘法；LoSiA-Pro是其高效实现。

Result: LoSiA在领域专业化和常识推理任务中性能接近全微调，训练时间最短；LoSiA-Pro延迟降低27%。

Conclusion: LoSiA高效且性能优异，减少遗忘，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多异常检测任务中，目标变量的正常性受上下文变量影响，但这些变量本身并非异常指标。现有方法未充分建模不确定性。

Method: 基于异方差高斯过程回归，将Z-score视为随机变量，提供反映异常评估可靠性的置信区间。

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学实际应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有CAD方法。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性驱动的决策过程，在医疗等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Motivation: 在线强化学习中样本效率低的问题源于探索效率不足，而现有方法未能充分利用专家演示和模拟器重置功能。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的困难探索环境中，该方法实现了最先进的样本效率。

Conclusion: 合理利用专家演示和模拟器重置功能，结合安全性指导的初始状态分布选择，可显著提升在线强化学习的样本效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Conclusion: any4是一种高效、无需预处理的4位量化方法，适用于多种大型语言模型，并开源了相关代码。

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large
language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without
requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy
compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

Result: 通过AR/VR应用的视觉问答和扩散驱动图像生成的案例研究验证了MLLM-SC的有效性。

Conclusion: MLLM-SC框架能够有效支持6G网络中任务导向和上下文感知的无线通信。

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Conclusion: UrbanMind为实现未来城市中的通用LLM代理迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Motivation: DRL系统在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但其安全性研究不足，尤其是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出两种新型攻击：TrojanentRL（利用组件级漏洞植入持久后门）和InfrectroRL（无需训练数据的后训练攻击）。

Result: 在六种Atari环境中，攻击效果与现有训练时后门攻击相当，且能规避两种主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了DRL供应链的严重漏洞，呼吁加强防御机制。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Motivation: 现有物理推理方法通常依赖自回归模型，无法灵活处理多时间步条件。

Method: 采用对象中心的去噪扩散模型架构，具有时间平移不变性和对象置换不变性。

Result: 模型能解决多条件任务，并在推理时适应对象数量和轨迹长度的变化。

Conclusion: 该方法为物理推理提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Conclusion: EAMil为自身免疫疾病的检测和分类提供了可解释的框架，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across

Motivation: 现有的大规模、非结构化数据集成本高、质量难以评估且存在隐私和伦理问题，因此需要一种更高效、安全的训练方法。

Method: 利用多个小规模、领域特定的数据集，结合元学习在Meta-Album集合上训练上下文学习模型，并在不同设置下评估其性能。

Result: 模型在训练域外表现出良好的泛化能力，性能与单一大规模数据集训练的模型相当，同时在模块化和可替换性方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据集集合训练，Transformer模型仍能实现有效的上下文预测，并提供额外的灵活性和安全性优势。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Conclusion: 通过状态工具和多轮交互，能够显著提升大型语言模型在推理计算中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注孤立的成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义PPI网络的能力，这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个包含21,484个蛋白质和186,818个相互作用的高质量多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种评估范式：拓扑导向任务和功能导向任务。

Result: 实验表明，现有PPI模型在恢复PPI网络的结构和功能特性方面存在潜在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台，支持真实的生物应用。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试中，模型排名存在矛盾，阻碍了模型选择和比较，作者希望通过统一微调解决这一问题。

Method: 采用“train-before-test”方法，对61个模型在24个基准测试上进行统一的基准特定微调后再评估。

Result: 该方法显著提高了模型排名的一致性，减少了排名分歧，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将“train-before-test”作为语言模型基准测试的默认组成部分。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

### [592] [Does Overnight News Explain Overnight Returns?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04481)
*Paul Glasserman,Kriste Krstovski,Paul Laliberte,Harry Mamaysky*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: 过去30年，美国股市的收益主要来自隔夜交易，而日内交易收益为负或持平。研究发现，这一现象与日内和隔夜新闻特征密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨美国股市日内与隔夜收益差异的原因，尤其是新闻对市场的影响。

Method: 使用240万篇新闻文章，采用监督主题分析技术，筛选能解释同期市场收益的新闻主题。

Result: 新闻主题的时间变化和对新闻的不同反应共同导致日内与隔夜收益差异。模型能预测哪些股票在隔夜表现优异或日内表现不佳。

Conclusion: 新闻是解释隔夜收益的重要机制，与其他文献提出的机制形成对比。

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have
been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or
flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through
features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4
million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis
that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous
market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics
and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the
difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our
approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and
particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of
continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the
effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain
overnight returns.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自然语言中量词表达的逻辑与算术特征结合，提出了一种片段化的形式化系统，并研究了其扩展与复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自然语言中逻辑与算术特征的结合，超越定性/定量的严格划分，探索其在语言和数学实践中的表现。

Method: 使用一阶逻辑与计数算子的片段化方法，提供范式形式，研究其可定义性和复杂性，并扩展到二阶逻辑和模态逻辑。

Result: 确定了有限和无限模型上可定义的算术概念，揭示了逻辑与算术的相互定义性，并展示了某些逻辑的不可判定性。

Conclusion: 形式化系统与自然语言量词结构相符，提出了重新思考定性/定量划分的观点，并建议与认知科学实证研究结合。

Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical
and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and
quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common
linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural
language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and
cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and
drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a
small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning
about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide
normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical
notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we
discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,
and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form
methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to
additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple
counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We
also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility
relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such
as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the
architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and
syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of
logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the
qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical
findings in cognitive science.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用SRL理论特征改进e-learning平台中学生自我调节学习的建模，提升预测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有e-learning平台难以有效支持学生的自我调节学习（SRL），因其循环和无方向性的特点难以用传统机器学习框架建模。

Method: 应用SRL理论特征对学习轨迹数据建模，以提升预测性和解释性。

Result: 实验表明，这些特征显著提高了预测准确性，验证了循环建模技术的价值。

Conclusion: 研究支持进一步探索循环建模技术，以更好地理解和优化e-learning环境中的SRL活动。

Abstract: Many e-learning platforms assert their ability or potential to improve
students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected
nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for
representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply
SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students'
SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the
causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that
these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further
research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.

Abstract: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education requires
teachers to develop AI competencies while preparing students for a society
influenced by AI. This study evaluates the impact of an online teacher training
program on German in-service teachers' AI literacy, usage behaviors, and
attitudes toward AI. A pre-post design study was conducted with teachers (N1 =
291 for AI literacy, N2 = 436 for attitude assessment) participating in the
course. The program combined synchronous and asynchronous learning formats,
including webinars, self-paced modules, and practical projects. The
participants exhibited notable improvements across all domains: AI literacy
scores increased significantly, and all attitude items regarding AI usage and
integration demonstrated significant positive changes. Teachers reported
increased confidence in AI integration. Structured teacher training programs
effectively enhance AI literacy and foster positive attitudes toward AI in
education.

Motivation: 探究生成式AI在STEM教育评估中的表现及其对学生的影响，以应对技术进步带来的机遇与挑战。

Method: 构建了一个高质量的大学STEM问题数据集，分析了问题特征对AI和学生表现的影响，并比较了四种模型家族和五种提示策略的效果。

Result: 最佳AI模型平均正确率为58.5%，但在涉及视觉内容的问题上表现不如学生。人类表现稳定但受学科影响，而AI表现受问题和学科特征双重影响。

Conclusion: 研究为教育者提供了优化问题设计的建议，以在不增加学生负担的情况下提升学术诚信。

Abstract: Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input
capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these
advancements could influence assessment design and question answering,
presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we
introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions,
manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity,
and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI
performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five
prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses
per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of
the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently
outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human
performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject,
whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question
features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating
how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that
challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for
students.

Conclusion: 研究为CS教育和竞赛中LLMs的应用提供了见解，并发布了公开数据集和教育应用以支持未来研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various
domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising
questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This
study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)
dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science
competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived
such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for
others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The
Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical
programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current
LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),
providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition
settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding
educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM
usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and
policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly
available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational
application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using
the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

TL;DR: 英国在AI监管上采取了介于欧盟和美国之间的独特路径，成为全球AI安全协调的领导者。从2012年关注偏见问题到2022年的“支持创新”策略，再到2023年成立AI安全研究所并举办国际峰会，但未直接监管前沿AI开发。2024年新政府承诺填补这一空白，但尚未行动。建议建立灵活的原则性监管机构，应对生物设计工具风险，并更新法律框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨英国如何在促进AI创新与管控风险之间找到平衡，以展示民主社会如何有效利用AI。

Method: 分析英国AI监管的历史演变及现状，提出建立原则性监管机构、更新法律框架等建议。

Result: 英国在AI监管上取得一定进展，但仍需填补前沿AI开发的监管空白，并应对新兴风险。

Conclusion: 英国若能完善AI监管，可为民主社会在利用AI优势的同时管控风险提供示范。

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than
the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a
global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from
companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about
catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time
focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved
into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing
regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but
avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived
in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The
UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and
hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -
refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new
government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the
time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:
harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating
risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based
regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures
against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more
technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated
misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,
discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but
important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic
societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.

Method: 分析研究员电脑中的文本文件（如文章、邮件、草稿）和非文本数据，估计约100万字的训练数据，用于微调GPT-4等模型。

Result: 研究发现数据量足以高保真地复制研究员的写作风格、专业知识和修辞声音，并提出了扩展应用的可能性。

Conclusion: AI驱动的电子副本在智力遗产保存和增强方面具有潜力，但需解决伦理和安全问题。

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a
deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored
in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited
researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and
drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for
AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained
models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise,
and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential
enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the
AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include
communication between living researchers and their electronic copies,
collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and
interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information
access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership
and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for
responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for
AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶车辆的定义无法涵盖其与人类和机器的交互、目标适应等更广泛的认知和社交能力，因此需要引入AgVs的概念。

Method: 通过整合代理AI、机器人技术、多智能体系统和人机交互的进展，提出一个系统级框架，重点关注AgVs的认知和通信层。

Result: AgVs通过高级推理和工具使用，能够作为嵌入移动生态系统中的交互代理，而不仅仅是计算工具。

Conclusion: 论文指出了AgVs开发和治理中的关键挑战，包括安全性、实时控制、公众接受度、伦理对齐和监管框架。

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity
to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly,
autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their
environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.
However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase
vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE
levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,
contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly
with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.
These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the
broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered
mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles
(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and
interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level
framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative
layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant
advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine
interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and
tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive
agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key
challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety,
real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI热潮的持续，组织面临压力，可能夸大或淡化其AI使用，甚至违背事实。研究旨在探讨这种虚假声明对消费者的影响。

Method: 通过2x2实验设计（N=401），研究虚假夸大和虚假否认对消费者态度和购买意图的影响，并分析感知背叛的中介作用。

Result: 虚假否认比诚实否认引发更负面的道德判断，而虚假夸大无显著影响。感知背叛是这些结果的中介因素。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI-washing如何侵蚀信任，为政策制定者、营销人员和研究人员提供了明确的伦理启示，强调透明性的重要性。

Abstract: As AI hype continues to grow, organizations face pressure to broadcast or
downplay purported AI initiatives - even when contrary to truth. This paper
introduces AI-washing as overstating (deceptive boasting) or understating
(deceptive denial) a company's real AI usage. A 2x2 experiment (N = 401)
examines how these false claims affect consumer attitudes and purchase
intentions. Results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: deceptive denial evokes more
negative moral judgments than honest negation, while deceptive boasting has no
effects. We show that perceived betrayal mediates these outcomes. By clarifying
how AI-washing erodes trust, the study highlights clear ethical implications
for policymakers, marketers, and researchers striving for transparency.

Motivation: 社会学可以补充其他学科在聊天机器人研究中的不足，关注社会结构对使用行为的影响。

Conclusion: 社会学理论有助于推动人类与聊天机器人互动的理论发展和社会公益应用。

Abstract: Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI
agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial
intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this
growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine,
psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest
sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four
sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two
theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new
insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook
sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic
discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines
individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional
dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory,
fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of
chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by
leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to
cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance
communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value
of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot
interaction and developing chatbots for social good.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助认证框架高效且可行，适用于大规模物联网网络。

Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across
vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications.
Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and
motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and
study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in
IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is
optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as
possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are
offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another
challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy
arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the
UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices
to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our
solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to
attestation by 30%.

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a
fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a
key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental
data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this
work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the
positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the
growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence.
Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust,
data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through
comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the
logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of
determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time
series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the
Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high
computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning
algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for
practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening
new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time
series data are available.

### [608] [Bittensor Protocol: The Bitcoin in Decentralized Artificial Intelligence? A Critical and Empirical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02951)
*Elizabeth Lui,Jiahao Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文通过比较Bittensor与比特币的代币经济学、去中心化特性、共识机制和激励结构，探讨Bittensor是否能成为去中心化人工智能领域的比特币。研究发现Bittensor存在代币和奖励的高度集中问题，并提出了一系列协议级干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bittensor是否具备成为去中心化人工智能领域比特币的潜力，并解决其代币和奖励集中的问题。

Method: 利用64个活跃Bittensor子网的链上数据，分析代币和奖励分布，并提出激励调整和安全漏洞缓解的协议级解决方案。

Result: 研究发现Bittensor的代币和奖励高度集中，激励与质量不匹配。提出的解决方案包括性能加权排放分配、复合评分和信任奖励乘数，以及代币持有上限。

Conclusion: Bittensor目前存在代币和奖励集中的问题，但通过协议级干预措施可以有效改善激励结构和安全性。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of
decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics,
decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure
against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor
subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and
rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake,
highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a
remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions.
For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted
emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for
mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and
empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the
median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust
across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使是最先进的LLM和防御措施仍易受多轮越狱攻击，尤其是Crescendo攻击。这种攻击通过逐步引导模型输出看似良性的内容，最终实现有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮越狱攻击对LLM系统的安全部署构成威胁，现有单轮防御措施对此无效，需研究其机制以开发针对性防御。

Method: 通过分析Crescendo多轮攻击在模型中间表示层面的效果，探究其如何逐步引导模型输出良性内容。

Result: 研究发现，随着对话轮数增加，安全对齐的LLM更倾向于将Crescendo响应视为良性，导致防御失效。

Conclusion: 多轮攻击需针对性防御措施，填补单轮防御的不足，确保LLM系统安全。

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses
remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only
closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a
significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We
study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of
intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often
represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the
number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each
turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of
representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful
requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses
like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks,
motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

### [610] [A Novel Active Learning Approach to Label One Million Unknown Malware Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02959)
*Ahmed Bensaoud,Jugal Kalita*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新颖的主动学习方法，用于标记一百万恶意软件样本，其中ViT-BNN方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低标记样本的成本，通过主动学习选择模型最不确定的样本进行标注。

Method: 提出两种模型：Inception-V4+PCA结合多种SVM算法，以及ViT-BNN（基于Vision Transformer的贝叶斯神经网络）。

Result: ViT-BNN在处理不确定性时更稳定和鲁棒。

Conclusion: ViT-BNN是一种先进的主动学习方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling
samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least
certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can
provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior
distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by
posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel
active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to
different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA
combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM,
SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural
Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning
approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular
task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in
handling uncertainty.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用交互式图可视化技术提升隐私政策的可理解性，并通过图挖掘算法识别关键主题，以增强用户对个人数据的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私政策通常冗长复杂，非专家用户难以理解，导致数据收集、处理和共享的透明度不足。随着对在线隐私的担忧增加，开发自动化工具分析隐私政策并识别潜在风险至关重要。

Method: 采用交互式图可视化技术将政策条款表示为结构化图模型，并使用图挖掘算法（如t-SNE和PCA）识别关键主题（如用户活动和设备信息）。

Result: 研究发现基于图的聚类提高了政策内容的可解释性，揭示了用户跟踪和数据共享的模式，支持法医调查和识别监管违规。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合交互式可视化和图挖掘，推动了AI驱动的隐私政策审计工具的发展，增强了透明度和信任。

Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for
non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the
collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online
privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing
privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the
potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of
privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This
approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make
informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining
algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device
Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to
assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based
clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in
user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and
identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools
for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with
graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力参数矩阵标准差分布的鲁棒LLM指纹方法，用于模型认证和版权保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM训练成本增加和模型重用普及，版权和知识产权保护面临挑战，现有水印技术对持续训练不鲁棒。

Method: 通过分析不同层注意力参数矩阵的标准差分布，发现其独特且稳定的模式，作为模型指纹。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，并发现华为Pangu Pro MoE模型可能源自Qwen-2.5 14B模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模模型开发中的知识产权保护提供了重要工具，持续训练无法完全掩盖模型来源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant copyright and intellectual
property challenges as the cost of training increases and model reuse becomes
prevalent. While watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect model
ownership, they may not be robust to continue training and development, posing
serious threats to model attribution and copyright protection. This work
introduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based
on intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation
distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit
distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued
training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints
that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright
infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication. Notably,
our investigation uncovers evidence that a recently Pangu Pro MoE model
released by Huawei is derived from Qwen-2.5 14B model through upcycling
techniques rather than training from scratch, highlighting potential cases of
model plagiarism, copyright violation, and information fabrication. These
findings underscore the critical importance of developing robust fingerprinting
methods for protecting intellectual property in large-scale model development
and emphasize that deliberate continued training alone is insufficient to
completely obscure model origins.

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）方法，通过结构化、基于规则的奖励信号重新定义优势函数和奖励信号，应用于漏洞检测任务。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO在泛化能力、推理能力和性能方面优于标准监督微调（SFT）。

Conclusion: RL-based训练有潜力显著提升LLMs在漏洞检测中的性能和推理能力。

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based
security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we
present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning
techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as
their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing
to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for
guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its
application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage
functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the
field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing
multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization,
reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised
finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of
RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of
LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

TL;DR: CollabIoT是一个基于LLM的系统，用于在瞬态IoT环境中实现安全无缝的设备协作，通过自动生成细粒度访问控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瞬态IoT环境中设备协作的复杂性，尤其是非专家用户难以手动实现细粒度访问控制策略，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的方法将用户意图转化为访问控制策略，并使用基于能力的授权和轻量级代理实现策略执行。

Result: LLM策略生成准确率达100%，设备配置时间约150毫秒，网络和控制开销分别不超过2毫秒和0.3毫秒。

Conclusion: CollabIoT在安全性和效率上表现优异，适用于瞬态IoT环境中的设备协作。

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and
actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services,
enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling
such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact
with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,
fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure
interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for
non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically
configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.
Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and
seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs
a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level
intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless
device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for
authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing
hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto
configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in
large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation
pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%
accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new
devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of
up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在越狱攻击中的普遍现象——注意力滑移，并提出了一种直接对抗该现象的新防御方法——注意力锐化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会和技术中的重要性增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要。越狱攻击利用漏洞绕过安全防护，但目前对其机制理解不足。

Method: 研究发现越狱攻击中普遍存在注意力滑移现象，并提出注意力锐化方法，通过温度缩放直接调整注意力分数分布。

Result: 实验表明，注意力锐化能有效抵抗多种越狱攻击，同时在良性任务上保持性能，且无额外计算或内存开销。

Conclusion: 注意力锐化是一种高效且实用的防御方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and
technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit
vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.
However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this
paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:
Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the
attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack
process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is
consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token
replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.
Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token
Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention
Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of
mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,
a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the
attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four
leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)
show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while
maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention
Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it
an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨低精度量化如何影响语言模型的安全对齐，以防止参数操纵攻击。

Method: 提出梯度引导攻击，包括渐进位级搜索算法和词级攻击，并在不同量化方案下测试。

Result: FP8和INT8量化模型对攻击表现较强抵抗力，但INT4和FP16模型较脆弱；攻击后的量化转移性差异显著。

Conclusion: 量化（特别是FP8）能增强模型安全性，但需注意攻击后的量化转移漏洞。

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet
their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks,
such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly
deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper
investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across
different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a
tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a
comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on
Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and
weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization
significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high
success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack
budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and
50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8
models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to
INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation
locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,
with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,
jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent
FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced
transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common
quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct
parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist,
especially through post-attack quantization.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击评估方法不一致且不可靠，导致结果偏差和虚假安全感。

Result: AttackBench提供了标准化和可复现的评估条件，帮助识别最可靠的攻击方法。

Conclusion: AttackBench为鲁棒性验证提供了可靠的基础，支持持续更新。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion
attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often
remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched
models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can
lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness
claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a
false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation
reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess
the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible
conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack
implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers
and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in
subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing
conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for
robustness verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本引导图像编辑中的伦理和版权问题，防止未经授权的修改。

Method: 将图像分类为允许和禁止集，设计不同的训练目标（允许集保持高质量编辑，禁止集鼓励模糊或语义模糊的输出），并通过轻量级微调实现。

Result: SecureT2I在多个数据集和模型上有效降低了禁止图像的编辑质量，同时保持允许集的性能，且优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SecureT2I提供了一种有效的解决方案，平衡了编辑权限控制与编辑质量，适用于通用和领域特定模型。

Abstract: Text-guided image manipulation with diffusion models enables flexible and
precise editing based on prompts, but raises ethical and copyright concerns due
to potential unauthorized modifications. To address this, we propose SecureT2I,
a secure framework designed to prevent unauthorized editing in diffusion-based
generative models. SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and
domain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning
without architectural changes. We categorize images into a permit set and a
forbid set based on editing permissions. For the permit set, the model learns
to perform high-quality manipulations as usual. For the forbid set, we
introduce training objectives that encourage vague or semantically ambiguous
outputs (e.g., blurred images), thereby suppressing meaningful edits. The core
challenge is to block unauthorized editing while preserving editing quality for
permitted inputs. To this end, we design separate loss functions that guide
selective editing behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and
models show that SecureT2I effectively degrades manipulation quality on
forbidden images while maintaining performance on permitted ones. We also
evaluate generalization to unseen inputs and find that SecureT2I consistently
outperforms baselines. Additionally, we analyze different vagueness strategies
and find that resize-based degradation offers the best trade-off for secure
manipulation control.

Motivation: 准确的恶意软件家族分类可以自动化样本标注和理解，提升如VirusTotal等平台的效率。

Method: 研究使用FSS特征，类似RAG的方式，开发了一个评估框架，涵盖67个家族的4,347个样本，分析了2,500万字符串，并对四个主要模块的设计选择进行了消融研究。

Result: 通过详细实验评估了不同设计选择对MFC的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，传统二进制字符串特征在LLMs和RAG时代仍可用于MFC，FSS特征是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Malware Family Classification (MFC) aims to identify the fine-grained family
(e.g., GuLoader or BitRAT) to which a potential malware sample belongs, in
contrast to malware detection or sample classification that predicts only an
Yes/No. Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample
labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as
VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In
this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary
string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how
Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to
RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework
covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25
million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of
different design choices in four major modules.

Conclusion: 提出了一个防御框架和基于任务向量的投毒检测方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data
poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional
manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning
models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While
existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we
propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP)
threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP
adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous
and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task
within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent
conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image
corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole
continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on
past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm.
Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison
task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at
https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .

unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are
vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of
mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework
AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen
content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution
environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling
over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58
reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content,
while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14
popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to
be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile
GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings
reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading
third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted
attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the
employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess
training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and
opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and
data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.

*Hyunwook Choi,Sangyun Won,Daeyeon Hwang,Junhyeok Choi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: README框架通过深度水印技术实现高容量、抗错误的数字签名嵌入，显著提升零比特错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习水印技术容量低且易受比特错误影响，无法满足高安全性应用（如数字签名）的需求。

Method: 结合裁剪容量扩展机制和轻量级错误纠正模块（ERPA），利用DCSS定位并纠正比特错误。

Result: 在2048位数字签名嵌入中，零比特错误率从1.2%提升至86.3%。

Conclusion: README填补了信号级水印与密码学安全之间的空白，适用于高安全性应用。

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for
robust image authentication and protection. However, existing models are
limited by low embedding capacity and vulnerability to bit-level errors, making
them unsuitable for cryptographic applications such as digital signatures,
which require over 2048 bits of error-free data. In this paper, we propose
README (Robust Error-Aware Digital Signature via Deep WaterMarking ModEl), a
novel framework that enables robust, verifiable, and error-tolerant digital
signatures within images. Our method combines a simple yet effective
cropping-based capacity scaling mechanism with ERPA (ERror PAinting Module), a
lightweight error correction module designed to localize and correct bit errors
using Distinct Circular Subsum Sequences (DCSS). Without requiring any
fine-tuning of existing pretrained watermarking models, README significantly
boosts the zero-bit-error image rate (Z.B.I.R) from 1.2% to 86.3% when
embedding 2048-bit digital signatures into a single image, even under
real-world distortions. Moreover, our use of perceptual hash-based signature
verification ensures public verifiability and robustness against tampering. The
proposed framework unlocks a new class of high-assurance applications for deep
watermarking, bridging the gap between signal-level watermarking and
cryptographic security.

Abstract: The persistent threat of Android malware presents a serious challenge to the
security of millions of users globally. While many machine learning-based
methods have been developed to detect these threats, their reliance on large
labeled datasets limits their effectiveness against emerging, previously unseen
malware families, for which labeled data is scarce or nonexistent.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a novel zero-shot learning framework
that combines Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) with Siamese Neural
Networks (SNN) to identify malware without needing prior examples of specific
malware families. Our approach leverages graph-based representations of Android
applications, enabling the model to detect subtle structural differences
between benign and malicious software, even in the absence of labeled data for
new threats.
  Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
MaMaDroid, especially in zero-day malware detection. Our model achieves 96.24%
accuracy and 95.20% recall for unknown malware families, highlighting its
robustness against evolving Android threats.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their
exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating
human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges,
methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a
foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling
technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in
AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep
learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack
contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate
LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper
contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for
intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting
LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven
NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is
proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection
workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this
paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster
innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By
presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire
advancement in next-generation network security systems.

Result: 大规模实验揭示了攻击与防御在现实条件下的未知局限性和失败模式。

Conclusion: BackFed为研究人员提供了可靠评估工具，并为联邦学习安全提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model
updates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and
defenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and
unrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce
BackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline,
and reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on
practical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its
multi-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation
and the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via
well-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed
as a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably
evaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale
studies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer
Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures
and experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of
proposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of
failures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable
guidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of
FL systems. Our framework is openly available at

Conclusion: 强调需加强RAG系统文档加载过程的安全性，防止隐蔽内容操纵。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since
ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a
key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge.
However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new
vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading
stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by
exploiting document ingestion.
  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce
two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection --
targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit
implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data
loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further
validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box
pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants --
demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass
filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the
urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against
covert content manipulations.

Conclusion: sc-iLTL和MCTS结合为复杂感知任务提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

Motivation: 传统博弈论假设完全理性，无法真实反映驾驶员决策的复杂性，尤其是在无保护左转场景中。

Method: 提出两玩家标准形式博弈模型，使用QRE求解，结合EM算法和神经网络优化参数。

Result: 模型能更准确地捕捉驾驶员的有限理性和决策倾向，比NE模型更现实高效。

Conclusion: 该模型为自动驾驶系统提供了更真实和鲁棒的决策行为分析。

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究开发了可解释的深度学习模型，结合临床数据和影像学信息，预测大血管闭塞（LVO）卒中患者的功能性结局和个体化治疗效果（ITE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机械取栓已成为LVO卒中的标准治疗，但仅50%成功治疗患者预后良好，因此需要更精准的预测工具。

Method: 利用449名LVO卒中患者的随机临床试验数据，结合临床变量、非增强CT（NCCT）和血管造影（CTA）扫描，通过深度学习模型预测功能结局和ITE。

Result: 临床变量对二元功能结局预测有较好效果（AUC 0.719），加入CTA影像后略有提升（AUC 0.737），但NCCT或联合NCCT与CTA未带来改善。ITE估计的区分能力有限（C-for-Benefit约0.55）。

Conclusion: 模型整合了影像和临床特征，实现了先进的预测性能，但需进一步研究以改进ITE估计。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光条件下传统图像增强方法噪声放大且细节丢失，事件相机虽有潜力但现有融合方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出EvRWKV框架，结合Cross-RWKV模块和EISFE模块，实现时空对齐与噪声抑制。

Result: 在真实低光数据集上表现优异，噪声抑制、细节恢复和视觉清晰度提升显著。

Conclusion: EvRWKV为低光成像提供了一种高效解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Capturing high-quality visual content under low-light conditions remains a
challenging problem due to severe noise, motion blur, and underexposure, which
degrade the performance of downstream applications. Traditional frame-based
low-light enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve
structural details, especially in real-world scenarios. Event cameras, offering
high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously
capturing brightness changes, emerge as promising alternatives for low-light
imaging. However, existing event-image fusion methods suffer from simplistic
fusion strategies and inadequate handling of spatial-temporal misalignment and
noise. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that
enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our
approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted
Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion,
and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly
performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain
deformable convolution alignment. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on real-world low-light datasets(SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that
EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image
quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving
visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.

Abstract: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is
visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively
record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify
their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In
this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging
event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We
demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even
for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental
distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality
at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提高了分类性能，还通过概念化特征和可解释的映射过程，推动了深度学习在PolSAR图像分类中的可解释性研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) based methods have received extensive and
sufficient attention in the field of PolSAR image classification, which show
excellent performance. However, due to the ``black-box" nature of DL methods,
the interpretation of the high-dimensional features extracted and the
backtracking of the decision-making process based on the features are still
unresolved problems. In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt
to achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image
classification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition
(PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique
to the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the
polarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept
Bottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are
transformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable
polarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)
is used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise
and understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced
non-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR
datasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of
achieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the
analytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can
be obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the
interpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.

Conclusion: EdgeSRIE在资源有限环境下实现了高质量的实时超声成像，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details,
leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based
techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their
high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as
portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a
lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image
enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed
framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch,
which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a
deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware
implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and
deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption.
In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE
achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient
magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based
methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time
inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational
requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These
results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality
ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强解决了高光谱图像数据不足和噪声问题，提高了癌细胞细胞质检测的准确性。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images are commonly used to detect
nuclear or cancerous regions in cells from images captured by a microscope.
Identifying cancer cytoplasm is crucial for determining the type of cancer;
hence, obtaining accurate cancer cytoplasm regions in cell images is important.
While CMOS images often lack detailed information necessary for diagnosis,
hyperspectral images provide more comprehensive cell information. Using a deep
learning model, we propose a method for detecting cancer cell cytoplasm in
hyperspectral images. Deep learning models require large datasets for learning;
however, capturing a large number of hyperspectral images is difficult.
Additionally, hyperspectral images frequently contain instrumental noise,
depending on the characteristics of the imaging devices. We propose a data
augmentation method to account for instrumental noise. CMOS images were used
for data augmentation owing to their visual clarity, which facilitates manual
annotation compared to original hyperspectral images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high
spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity
through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications
such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS
faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating
realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial
network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method
incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules
and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological
plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the
framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to
produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions.
Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in
downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for
data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS
datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data
limitations.

*Zetian Feng,Juan Fu,Xuebin Zou,Hongsheng Ye,Hong Wu,Jianhua Zhou,Yi Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的混合视图注意力（HVA）网络，用于3D TRUS中的临床显著前列腺癌分类，结合了CNN和Transformer架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRUS在诊断前列腺癌时存在低对比度和各向异性空间分辨率的局限性，需要更准确的分类方法。

Method: 采用CNN提取局部特征，Transformer的HVA模块建模全局依赖关系，并通过混合视图自适应融合模块动态聚合特征。

Result: 在590名患者的内部数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HVA网络显著提升了临床显著前列腺癌的分类性能。

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men,
and accurate identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) is critical
for timely intervention. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is widely used for
prostate biopsy; however, its low contrast and anisotropic spatial resolution
pose diagnostic challenges. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
hybrid-view attention (HVA) network for csPCa classification in 3D TRUS that
leverages complementary information from transverse and sagittal views. Our
approach integrates a CNN-transformer hybrid architecture, where convolutional
layers extract fine-grained local features and transformer-based HVA models
global dependencies. Specifically, the HVA comprises intra-view attention to
refine features within a single view and cross-view attention to incorporate
complementary information across views. Furthermore, a hybrid-view adaptive
fusion module dynamically aggregates features along both channel and spatial
dimensions, enhancing the overall representation. Experiments are conducted on
an in-house dataset containing 590 subjects who underwent prostate biopsy.
Comparative and ablation results prove the efficacy of our method. The code is
available at https://github.com/mock1ngbrd/HVAN.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为PhotIQA的数据集，用于开发和测试图像质量评估（IQA）方法，特别针对光声成像（PAI），并展示了HaarPSI$_{med}$在相关性上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏质量评分的医学图像，现有的IQA方法主要针对自然图像开发，但在医学图像（如光声成像）中应用时存在不一致性。

Method: 构建了包含1134张光声重建图像的数据集PhotIQA，由专家对五种质量属性进行评分，并提供地面真实数据用于全参考评估。

Result: 实验表明，HaarPSI$_{med}$在相关性上显著优于SSIM（SRCC：0.83 vs. 0.62）。

Conclusion: PhotIQA数据集为光声成像的IQA研究提供了重要资源，并展示了HaarPSI$_{med}$的潜力。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel
algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning
based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most
commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA)
have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application
inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not
surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In
photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for
assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a
multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be
solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to
both, acoustic and optical, artifacts.
  To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures
we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic
(PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties
(overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background
intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow
full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used,
providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$
significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC:
0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续学习框架，通过双对齐策略（CNA和CRA模块）缓解医学图像分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法未能捕捉任务间的复杂依赖关系，导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用双对齐策略：CNA模块对齐当前与历史网络的瓶颈层特征，CRA模块对齐当前网络从历史缓冲数据和当前输入数据学到的特征。

Result: 实验证明该框架在医学图像分割任务中有效缓解了领域偏移下的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架通过复杂依赖关系的建模，显著提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning in medical image segmentation involves sequential data
acquisition across diverse domains (e.g., clinical sites), where task
interference between past and current domains often leads to catastrophic
forgetting. Existing continual learning methods fail to capture the complex
dependencies between tasks. We introduce a novel framework that mitigates
forgetting by establishing and enhancing complex dependencies between
historical data and the network in the present task. Our framework features a
dual-alignment strategy, the cross-network alignment (CNA) module aligns the
features extracted from the bottleneck layers of the current and previous
networks, respectively, while the cross-representation alignment (CRA) module
aligns the features learned by the current network from historical buffered
data and current input data, respectively. Implementing both types of alignment
is a non-trivial task. To address this, we further analyze the linear and
nonlinear forms of the well-established Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(HSIC) and deliberately design feature mapping and feature pairing blocks
within the CRA module. Experiments on medical image segmentation task
demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
under domain shifts.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用填充撕裂表面的方法分离主动脉夹层中的真假腔，为医生诊断提供视觉辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉夹层是一种严重疾病，需要紧急处理。通过分离真假腔，可以更好地辅助医生诊断，并推动相关研究（如配准、分割和血流动力学）。

Method: 使用数学形态学操作和Aktouf等人提出的闭合算法生成3D填充表面，利用这些表面切断真假腔之间的连接。

Result: 首次将填充撕裂表面作为图像处理操作符，成功分离了真假腔，并提供了主动脉夹层的初步图谱。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能辅助医生诊断，还为后续研究（如配准和血流动力学分析）提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency
management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the
normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then
creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens
are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of
connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection
3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us
to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and
characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces
are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the
framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the
intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete
data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling
surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these
holes.
  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections
between lumens in order to separate them.
  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image
processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen
separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic
dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.
  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance
several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).

Result: 在仿真和实验光学系统中验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了测量过程，降低了成本，同时保持了成像质量。

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture
imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide
field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of
low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is
introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the
camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's
spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and
complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes
changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates
measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a
novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane
intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without
knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in
simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

TL;DR: PLUS框架通过增强非对比CT（NCCT）图像上的肝脏病灶分析，显著提高了良恶性病灶的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D分割方法在区分良恶性肝脏病灶时存在局限性，且依赖专用成像模态，而NCCT更普遍。

Method: 提出PLUS，一种即插即用框架，用于增强任意3D分割模型在NCCT图像上的病灶分析能力。

Result: 在8,651名患者的实验中，PLUS显著提升了病灶级和患者级的F1分数。

Conclusion: PLUS有潜力通过广泛可用的NCCT成像显著改善恶性肝脏病灶的筛查。

Abstract: Focal liver lesions (FLL) are common clinical findings during physical
examination. Early diagnosis and intervention of liver malignancies are crucial
to improving patient survival. Although the current 3D segmentation paradigm
can accurately detect lesions, it faces limitations in distinguishing between
malignant and benign liver lesions, primarily due to its inability to
differentiate subtle variations between different lesions. Furthermore,
existing methods predominantly rely on specialized imaging modalities such as
multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging, whereas
non-contrast CT (NCCT) is more prevalent in routine abdominal imaging. To
address these limitations, we propose PLUS, a plug-and-play framework that
enhances FLL analysis on NCCT images for arbitrary 3D segmentation models. In
extensive experiments involving 8,651 patients, PLUS demonstrated a significant
improvement with existing methods, improving the lesion-level F1 score by
5.66%, the malignant patient-level F1 score by 6.26%, and the benign
patient-level F1 score by 4.03%. Our results demonstrate the potential of PLUS
to improve malignant FLL screening using widely available NCCT imaging
substantially.

<details>

Motivation: 血管分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有算法难以处理血管的低对比度和复杂拓扑结构，导致分割不完整或拓扑错误。

Method: PASC Net包含两个模块：SSL模块优化卷积核设计以增强对血管结构的适应性，HTC模块通过分层拓扑约束确保血管连通性。

Result: 在U-Net、FCN等架构中替换标准卷积为SSL卷积后，性能一致提升；在nnUNet框架中表现最佳，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: PASC Net通过结合SSL和HTC模块，有效解决了血管分割中的关键问题，显著提升了分割精度和拓扑准确性。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation is crucial to assist in clinical diagnosis by
medical experts. However,
  the intricate tree-like tubular structure of blood vessels poses significant
challenges for existing
  segmentation algorithms. Small vascular branches are often overlooked due to
their low contrast
  compared to surrounding tissues, leading to incomplete vessel segmentation.
Furthermore, the
  complex vascular topology prevents the model from accurately capturing and
reconstructing vascular
  structure, resulting in incorrect topology, such as breakpoints at the
bifurcation of the vascular tree.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vessel segmentation
framework called PASC Net. It includes two key modules: a plug-and-play shape
self-learning convolutional (SSL) module
  that optimizes convolution kernel design, and a hierarchical topological
constraint (HTC) module
  that ensures vascular connectivity through topological constraints.
Specifically, the SSL module
  enhances adaptability to vascular structures by optimizing conventional
convolutions into learnable
  strip convolutions, which improves the network's ability to perceive
fine-grained features of tubular
  anatomies. Furthermore, to better preserve the coherence and integrity of
vascular topology, the HTC
  module incorporates hierarchical topological constraints-spanning linear,
planar, and volumetric
  levels-which serve to regularize the network's representation of vascular
continuity and structural
  consistency. We replaced the standard convolutional layers in U-Net, FCN,
U-Mamba, and nnUNet
  with SSL convolutions, leading to consistent performance improvements across
all architectures.
  Furthermore, when integrated into the nnUNet framework, our method
outperformed other methods
  on multiple metrics, achieving state-of-the-art vascular segmentation
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于网格的多模态配准框架（Grid-Reg），用于解决机载SAR与星载光学图像配准的挑战，包括新的域鲁棒描述符提取网络（HSCMLNet）和网格求解器（Grid-solver）。

Motivation: 机载SAR与星载光学图像的配准对SAR图像解译和地理定位至关重要，但由于几何和辐射差异显著，现有方法难以处理。

Method: 提出Grid-Reg框架，包括HSCMLNet（混合Siamese相关度量学习网络）和Grid-solver（网格求解器），采用无检测器和全局匹配损失策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，Grid-Reg表现出优于现有技术的性能。

Conclusion: Grid-Reg通过全局匹配和网格求解器有效解决了跨平台异构图像配准问题。

Abstract: Registering airborne SAR with spaceborne optical images is crucial for SAR
image interpretation and geo-localization. It is challenging for this
cross-platform heterogeneous image registration due to significant geometric
and radiation differences, which current methods fail to handle. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a novel grid-based multimodal registration
framework (Grid-Reg) across airborne and space-born platforms, including a new
domain-robust descriptor extraction network, Hybrid Siamese Correlation Metric
Learning Network (HSCMLNet) and a grid-based solver (Grid-solver) for
transformation parameters estimation. Our Grid-Reg is based on detector-free
and global matching loss rather than accurate keypoint correspondences. These
accurate correspondences are inherently difficult in heterogeneous images with
large geometric deformation. By Grid-Solver, our Grid-Reg estimates
transformation parameters by optimizing robust global matching loss-based patch
correspondences of whole images in a coarse-to-fine strategy. To robustly
calculate the similarity between patches, specifically that have noise and
change objects, we propose HSCMLNet, including a hybrid Siamese module to
extract high-level features of multimodal images and a correlation learning
module (CMLModule) based equiangular unit basis vectors (EUBVs). Moreover, we
propose a manifold loss EUBVsLoss to constrain the normalized correlation
between local embeddings of patches and EUBVs. Furthermore, we curate a new
challenging benchmark dataset of SAR-to-optical registration using real-world
UAV MiniSAR data and optical images from Google Earth. We extensively analyze
factors affecting registration accuracy and compare our method with
state-of-the-art techniques on this dataset, showing superior performance.

Abstract: COVID-19 is a severe and acute viral disease that can cause symptoms
consistent with pneumonia in which inflammation is caused in the alveolous
regions of the lungs leading to a build-up of fluid and breathing difficulties.
Thus, the diagnosis of COVID using CT scans has been effective in assisting
with RT-PCR diagnosis and severity classifications. In this paper, we proposed
a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on
GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including
Label Distribution Aware Loss(LDAM Loss) and Class-balanced(CB) Loss to solve
the long-tail problem existing in datasets. Our model reaches more than 0.983

Result: 在EndoVis2018和EndoVis2017数据集上分别达到0.80和0.54的mIoU。

Conclusion: 该模型显著减轻专家负担，帮助学员独立理解复杂手术环境。

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables
surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools,
and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm
intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide
detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This
challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to
trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones
inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a
solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.
However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,
rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an
hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel
prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.
Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the
EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust
and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces
the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently
and effectively understand complex surgical environments.

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for
patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated
during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training
sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive
language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for
surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves
reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement
of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has
shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions,
texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.
CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic
context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL
module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through
iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018
and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming
state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This
superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive
learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Ovarian tumor, as a common gynecological disease, can rapidly deteriorate
into serious health crises when undetected early, thus posing significant
threats to the health of women. Deep neural networks have the potential to
identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public
datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian
tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains
\textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496
patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three
subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from
2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations
of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients.
It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian
tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of
ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset
Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion
of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and
complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves
as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification
of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method
exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the
two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance
of 85\%. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Multi-source data classification is a critical yet challenging task for
remote sensing image interpretation. Existing methods lack adaptability to
diverse land cover types when modeling frequency domain features. To this end,
we propose a Dynamic Frequency Feature Fusion Network (DFFNet) for
hyperspectral image (HSI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) / Light Detection
and Ranging (LiDAR) data joint classification. Specifically, we design a
dynamic filter block to dynamically learn the filter kernels in the frequency
domain by aggregating the input features. The frequency contextual knowledge is
injected into frequency filter kernels. Additionally, we propose
spectral-spatial adaptive fusion block for cross-modal feature fusion. It
enhances the spectral and spatial attention weight interactions via channel
shuffle operation, thereby providing comprehensive cross-modal feature fusion.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our DFFNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-source data classification. The codes will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/DFFNet.

Conclusion: FB-Diff为4D医学图像时间插值提供了一种更精确的方法，适用于临床呼吸运动建模。

Abstract: The temporal interpolation task for 4D medical imaging, plays a crucial role
in clinical practice of respiratory motion modeling. Following the simplified
linear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models
to interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions
should be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by
this property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency
perspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed
FB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration,
physiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics
of temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately
devised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors
and case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational
Autoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions
with motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and
ending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases
via the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation
task in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal
consistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics. Codes are
available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏一个全面的端到端模型来描述光输入与像素强度输出之间的相互作用，这对需要精确颜色和光谱数据解释的应用至关重要。

Abstract: The spectral response of a digital camera defines the mapping between scene
radiance and pixel intensity. Despite its critical importance, there is
currently no comprehensive model that considers the end-to-end interaction
between light input and pixel intensity output. This paper introduces a novel
technique to model the spectral response of an RGB digital camera, addressing
this gap. Such models are indispensable for applications requiring accurate
color and spectral data interpretation. The proposed model is tested across
diverse imaging scenarios by varying illumination conditions and is validated
against experimental data. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving
color fidelity and spectral accuracy, with significant implications for
applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and spectral imaging. This
approach offers a powerful tool for optimizing camera systems in scientific,
industrial, and creative domains where spectral precision is paramount.

*Zhengyue Zhuge,Jiahui Xu,Shiqi Chen,Hao Xu,Yueting Chen,Zhihai Xu,Huajun Feng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DDU的高效深度展开框架，用于解决DSSI系统中的重建问题，通过分析解和网络初始化策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSSI系统的重建算法研究有限，现有方法因光学编码机制不兼容而效果不佳。

Method: 提出DDU框架，包括分析解的数据保真项和网络初始化策略，兼容现有SOTA模型。

Result: 实验验证DDU性能优越，参数和计算复杂度与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: DDU为DSSI中的展开方法提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems acquire spectral data cubes through
compressed sensing. Recently, diffractive snapshot spectral imaging (DSSI)
methods have attracted significant attention. While various optical designs and
improvements continue to emerge, research on reconstruction algorithms remains
limited. Although numerous networks and deep unfolding methods have been
applied on similar tasks, they are not fully compatible with DSSI systems
because of their distinct optical encoding mechanism. In this paper, we propose
an efficient deep unfolding framework for diffractive systems, termed
diffractive deep unfolding (DDU). Specifically, we derive an analytical
solution for the data fidelity term in DSSI, ensuring both the efficiency and
the effectiveness during the iterative reconstruction process. Given the
severely ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ a network-based
initialization strategy rather than non-learning-based methods or linear
layers, leading to enhanced stability and performance. Our framework
demonstrates strong compatibility with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,
which effectively address the initialization and prior subproblem. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of the proposed DDU framework, showcasing
improved performance while maintaining comparable parameter counts and
computational complexity. These results suggest that DDU provides a solid
foundation for future unfolding-based methods in DSSI.

*Sungrae Hong,Sol Lee,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于传统Copy-Paste（CP）增强技术的新数据增强方法CP-Dilatation，用于解决医学图像分割中数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI诊断需要大量训练数据，但医学图像分割标注成本高且专家稀缺。

Method: 在传统CP技术基础上增加扩张操作，保留恶性肿瘤边界上下文信息。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他先进基线。

Conclusion: CP-Dilatation方法有效提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical AI diagnosis including histopathology segmentation has derived
benefits from the recent development of deep learning technology. However, deep
learning itself requires a large amount of training data and the medical image
segmentation masking, in particular, requires an extremely high cost due to the
shortage of medical specialists. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data
augmentation method built upon the conventional Copy and Paste (CP)
augmentation technique, called CP-Dilatation, and apply it to histopathology
image segmentation. To the well-known traditional CP technique, the proposed
method adds a dilation operation that can preserve the boundary context
information of the malignancy, which is important in histopathological image
diagnosis, as the boundary between the malignancy and its margin is mostly
unclear and a significant context exists in the margin. In our experiments
using histopathology benchmark datasets, the proposed method was found superior
to the other state-of-the-art baselines chosen for comparison.

### [655] [SPIDER: Structure-Preferential Implicit Deep Network for Biplanar X-ray Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04684)
*Tianqi Yu,Xuanyu Tian,Jiawen Yang,Dongming He,Jingyi Yu,Xudong Wang,Yuyao Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SPIDER是一种新型监督框架，用于从双平面X射线图像重建CT体积，通过结合组织结构和隐式神经表示解码器，解决了传统方法在骨骼几何和软组织边界上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双平面X射线成像在临床应用中因深度信息缺失和软组织模糊性导致3D重建困难，现有方法在骨骼几何和软组织边界上表现不佳。

Method: SPIDER通过统一的编码器-解码器架构，将组织结构作为先验知识嵌入隐式神经表示解码器，联合学习图像强度和结构。

Result: 实验表明，SPIDER仅需两个投影即可生成解剖学准确的CT重建，并在下游分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SPIDER在个性化治疗规划和图像引导手术导航中具有潜力。

Abstract: Biplanar X-ray imaging is widely used in health screening, postoperative
rehabilitation evaluation of orthopedic diseases, and injury surgery due to its
rapid acquisition, low radiation dose, and straightforward setup. However, 3D
volume reconstruction from only two orthogonal projections represents a
profoundly ill-posed inverse problem, owing to the intrinsic lack of depth
information and irreducible ambiguities in soft-tissue visualization. Some
existing methods can reconstruct skeletal structures and Computed Tomography
(CT) volumes, they often yield incomplete bone geometry, imprecise tissue
boundaries, and a lack of anatomical realism, thereby limiting their clinical
utility in scenarios such as surgical planning and postoperative assessment. In
this study, we introduce SPIDER, a novel supervised framework designed to
reconstruct CT volumes from biplanar X-ray images. SPIDER incorporates tissue
structure as prior (e.g., anatomical segmentation) into an implicit neural
representation decoder in the form of joint supervision through a unified
encoder-decoder architecture. This design enables the model to jointly learn
image intensities and anatomical structures in a pixel-aligned fashion. To
address the challenges posed by sparse input and structural ambiguity, SPIDER
directly embeds anatomical constraints into the reconstruction process, thereby
enhancing structural continuity and reducing soft-tissue artifacts. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on clinical head CT datasets and show that SPIDER
generates anatomically accurate reconstructions from only two projections.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong potential in downstream
segmentation tasks, underscoring its utility in personalized treatment planning
and image-guided surgical navigation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了合成图像（通过PGGAN生成）对糖尿病黄斑水肿（DME）分割任务中U-Net模型性能的影响，发现FID（衡量图像相似性）越低，合成数据对性能提升越显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像数据有限的问题，探索合成图像作为数据增强的有效性。

Method: 使用PGGAN生成合成图像，通过FID评估其与真实图像的相似性，并用于增强U-Net模型的训练数据。

Result: FID越低，合成数据对分割性能提升越显著；合成数据比标准增强技术更有效。

Conclusion: 合成图像在数据增强中表现优异，但需注意FID的相似性阈值。

Abstract: Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging
datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A
common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this
study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement
which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative
Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular
Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with
limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with
standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments.
Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve
segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets
decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and
robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is
significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations
follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model
performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard
augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower
FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the
results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are
sufficiently dissimilar.

Abstract: Brain tumor resection is a complex procedure with significant implications
for patient survival and quality of life. Predictions of patient outcomes
provide clinicians and patients the opportunity to select the most suitable
onco-functional balance. In this study, global features derived from structural
magnetic resonance imaging in a clinical dataset of 49 pre- and post-surgery
patients identified potential biomarkers associated with survival outcomes. We
propose a framework that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) with
neuroimaging-based feature engineering for survival assessment, offering
guidance for surgical decision-making. In this study, we introduce a global
explanation optimizer that refines survival-related feature attribution in deep
learning models, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Our findings
suggest that survival is influenced by alterations in regions associated with
cognitive and sensory functions, indicating the importance of preserving areas
involved in decision-making and emotional regulation during surgery to improve
outcomes. The global explanation optimizer improves both fidelity and
comprehensibility of explanations compared to state-of-the-art XAI methods. It
effectively identifies survival-related variability, underscoring its relevance
in precision medicine for brain tumor treatment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MurreNet的多模态表示解耦网络，用于改进癌症生存分析，通过分解模态特征并优化融合策略，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在多模态特征融合中未能充分捕捉模态间和模态内的交互，导致预测性能受限。

Method: 提出多模态表示分解模块（MRD）和深度整体正交融合策略（DHOF），结合新型训练正则化方法优化特征表示。

Result: 在六个TCGA癌症队列上的实验表明，MurreNet达到了最先进的生存预测性能。

Conclusion: MurreNet通过解耦和优化多模态特征，显著提升了癌症生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Cancer survival prediction requires integrating pathological Whole Slide
Images (WSIs) and genomic profiles, a challenging task due to the inherent
heterogeneity and the complexity of modeling both inter- and intra-modality
interactions. Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies
for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture
modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited
understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance.
To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation
Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis.
Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD)
module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and
modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between
modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined
then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes
constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of
modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated
into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF)
strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts
demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
survival prediction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SASHA是一种基于深度强化学习的方法，通过智能采样和选择性放大高分辨率区域，高效分析病理图像，匹配全分辨率分析方法的性能，同时显著降低计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）尺寸巨大，计算资源有限，且诊断标签通常仅适用于整个切片，精细标注成本高。此外，诊断信息通常仅占图像的一小部分，全分辨率分析效率低下。

Method: SASHA采用轻量级分层注意力多实例学习（MIL）模型学习特征，通过深度强化学习智能采样并选择性放大10-20%的高分辨率区域进行诊断。

Result: SASHA在性能上匹配全分辨率分析方法，同时显著降低计算和内存成本，优于其他稀疏采样方法。

Conclusion: SASHA为处理大尺寸、信息稀疏的医学图像提供了一种高效的智能采样解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology.
Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering
it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution.
Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert
annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive.
Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small
fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full
resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based
{\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep
reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological
images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight
hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second,
SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction
(10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show
that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at
high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs.
In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods.
We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging
challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images
containing sparsely informative features.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成更高分辨率且视角可控的图像。

Conclusion: 该方法对临床应用、医学教育和数据扩展具有重要意义。

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal
human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary
information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring
images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates
clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from
a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range,
resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer
to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for
stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over
viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for
clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension,
enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and
analysis. Our code is available at GitHub.

Abstract: The identification of cardiac phase is an essential step for analysis and
diagnosis of cardiac function. Automatic methods, especially data-driven
methods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an
unsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection
through self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from
4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for
manual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric
measurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable
spatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the
approach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2
frames (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised
methods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust
performance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for
ES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized
heart views due to fetal heart positioning variability. Our results demonstrate
the potential of the proposed latent motion trajectory strategy for cardiac
phase detection in adult and fetal echocardiography. This work advances
unsupervised cardiac motion analysis, offering a scalable solution for clinical
populations lacking annotated data. Code will be released at

Result: 数据集包含443张图像的实例分割标注和548张图像的SvdH评分，支持多种RA相关研究任务。

Conclusion: 该数据集有望推动腕骨RA及相关CAD研究的进展。

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the
focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In
clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the
screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist
is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this
area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality
instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with
narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring
detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression
in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,
which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating
expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist
bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)
Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for
wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional
radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level
instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548
images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks
related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression
quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte
detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal
bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the
barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within
the RA-related domain.

Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a
crucial problem in the realm of digital humans and the virtual metaverse.
Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this
field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However,
several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference
and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial
expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal
information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)
defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural
rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning
process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the
interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately
enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion
strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring
effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency,
making it suitable for real-world applications.

Result: 在多种3D网格和图像上验证了方法的有效性，能够实现全局一致和局部精确的编辑。

Conclusion: 3D PixBrush为3D网格的局部编辑提供了一种高效且无需用户输入的解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local
regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a
synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image.
Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise.
Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and
automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces
masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method
does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to
achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization
mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to
the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted
localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated
image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a
wide variety of meshes and images.

Result: F-Hash在多种时间变化体积数据集上实现了最先进的训练收敛速度。

Conclusion: F-Hash为特征跟踪和演化可视化提供了一种统一的编码解决方案，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its
complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works
transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous
Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression,
rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However,
training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling
large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash,
a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to
greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding
methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design
incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D
multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding
capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to
time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution
for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash
achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying
volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray
marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the
time-varying neural representation.

Conclusion: PointAMaLR在多尺度语义理解和实际应用中均表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in
point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on
reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective
utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely
for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel
self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and
processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.
PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local
regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while
upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling
complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature
representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in
the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate
PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset
ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model
achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only
validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but
also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

### [667] [A3FR: Agile 3D Gaussian Splatting with Incremental Gaze Tracked Foveated Rendering in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04147)
*Shuo Xin,Haiyu Wang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为A3FR的高效渲染框架，通过并行化注视跟踪和注视点渲染过程，显著降低了渲染延迟，同时保持了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实（VR）中的图像渲染对计算资源要求高，尤其是实时渲染时，延迟问题严重影响用户体验。现有的注视点渲染技术虽然能减少渲染成本，但注视跟踪过程本身的计算开销可能抵消其优势。

Method: 提出A3FR框架，并行化注视跟踪和注视点渲染过程，并采用3D高斯泼溅技术作为渲染算法。

Result: 实验表明，A3FR能将端到端渲染延迟降低至多2倍，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: A3FR框架有效解决了注视点渲染中的延迟问题，为VR应用提供了更高效的渲染解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces,
greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by
increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various
industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.
Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high
computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior
visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image
rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices
such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual
behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user
experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,
a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's
gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated
rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering
process.
  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the
computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes
outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To
address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework
called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated
rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering
processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a
state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate
that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while
maintaining visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型神经网络方法，用于实时动态头发模拟，突破了现有方法的限制，实现了高效稳定的模拟效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时头发模拟对虚拟角色真实感至关重要，但现有神经方法无法捕捉动态行为，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用完全自监督的神经网络方法，无需人工干预或艺术家生成数据，支持与头发重建方法集成。

Result: 方法在多种发型上验证有效，展示了实际应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态头发模拟提供了高效、稳定的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual
avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic
behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character
movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the
overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for
simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly
optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art
neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to
capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural
method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable
dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a
fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual
intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be
integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end
methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,
memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing
for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational
resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Wave Field Synthesis（WFS）在VR认知研究中增强听觉沉浸的可行性，发现WFS能提供更自然的听觉体验，但存在高度定位等局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR研究中听觉线索常被忽视，WFS能提升生态效度，因此研究其应用潜力。

Method: 通过实验比较WFS和传统立体声耳机在静态和动态声源定位中的表现，分析虚拟环境、声音类型和时长的影响。

Result: 立体声定位更准确，但WFS提供更自然的听觉体验，尤其在方向线索上。WFS系统存在高度定位不足等问题。

Conclusion: WFS在复杂声景研究中具有潜力，但需解决当前系统的局限性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the viability of Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) for
enhancing auditory immersion in VR-based cognitive research. While Virtual
Reality (VR) offers significant advantages for studying human perception and
behavior, auditory cues are often underutilized. WFS, an advanced audio
rendering technique, can create highly realistic and spatially accurate
soundscapes, potentially increasing ecological validity. This study evaluates
WFS by implementing a sample experiment where participants localize static and
moving sound sources in both a WFS-rendered environment and a conventional
stereo headphone setup. The research explores the impact of virtual
environments, sound types, and durations on localization accuracy and search
behavior. Findings indicate that while stereo setups can achieve higher
accuracy, WFS provides a more natural and intuitive auditory experience,
particularly for directional cues. The study also highlights limitations of
current WFS systems, such as the lack of height localization, occlusion
simulation, and user-dependent optimization, which affect performance,
especially for centrally located sound sources. Despite these challenges, WFS
shows promise for specialized auditory perception research, particularly for
complex soundscapes where directional information is paramount.

Result: 提出了混合现实（XR）技术作为视频会议局限性的潜在解决方案。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来研究者开发和测试混合现实技术，以改善视频会议的体验。

Abstract: Video conferencing has become a central part of our daily lives, thanks to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, so have its many limitations, resulting
in poor support for communicative and social behavior and ultimately, Zoom
fatigue. New technologies will be required to address these limitations,
including many drawn from mixed reality (XR). In this paper, our goals are to

Toward this end, we first survey research on the shortcomings of video
conferencing systems, as defined before and after the pandemic. We then
consider the methods that research uses to evaluate support for communicative
behavior, and argue that those same methods should be employed in identifying,
improving, and validating promising video conferencing technologies. Next, we
survey emerging XR solutions to video conferencing's limitations, most off
which do not employ head-mounted displays.

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by
human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in
tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating
human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and
aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA
fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert
AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D
printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA
fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic
preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic
appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration
in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human
feedback into AI design processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户偏好的多指标平行坐标图（PCP）优化权重方法，并通过雷达图和UMAP降维实现直观可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多指标情况下PCP颜色渐变难以直观表示的问题，避免线性加权的不明确性。

Method: 基于特定偏好组合计算最优权重，使用雷达图和UMAP降维在二维平面上可视化指标权衡。

Result: 在行人流引导规划中，方法成功识别了不同用户偏好下的控制参数重要性模式。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持用户在多指标场景下的直观选择和决策。

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the
relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an
interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is
challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present.
Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly
weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this
problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal
weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can
simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric
problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them
to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to
visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the
analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique
patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate
AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key
limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific
evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines
interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk
assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned
language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models
(LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI
explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to
support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a
mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the
conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear
understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific
evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported
that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

Motivation: 当前数字人类生成的瓶颈在于如何根据文本或语音输入生成自然的角色动作。

Method: 基于DiffuseStyleGesture模型，引入快速文本转录作为语义条件，并实现情感引导的无分类器扩散，使用轻量级Transformer架构融合多模态特征。

Result: 在ZeroEGGS数据集上，DeepGesture在人类相似度和上下文适当性上优于基线，支持情感状态插值和泛化到分布外语音。

Conclusion: DeepGesture为完全多模态、情感感知的数字人类迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware
digital humans.

Motivation: 研究如何通过界面设计鼓励用户输入更长的提示，以增强其对生成内容（如短篇故事）的心理所有权感。

Method: 采用两种交互技术（长按提交按钮和滑动滑块）进行实验，并进一步测试AI生成的扩展建议对提示长度和心理所有权的影响。

Result: 实验表明，这些界面修改显著增加了提示长度并提升了心理所有权；AI扩展建议进一步增加了提示长度，但未改善心理所有权。

Conclusion: 简单的界面修改可以有效促使用户输入更多内容并增强心理所有权，但AI扩展建议仅对提示长度有额外帮助。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering,
human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping

Result: 通过系统验证可区分真实计算现象与测量伪影，为AI心理学研究建立稳健基础。

Conclusion: 透明实践和验证工具是确保AI心理学研究有效性的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through
an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic
validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement
artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent
practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical
foundation for AI psychology research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI创造力工具缺乏对发散与收敛思维复杂协调的支持，限制了创意探索的深度和多样性。

Method: Reverger通过递归探索故事修改的高层方向（发散）和合成具体变体（收敛），支持用户灵活迭代。

Result: 用户研究表明，Reverger比基线工具更能探索意外和多样的方向，且用户感觉控制更精细、成果更有价值。

Conclusion: Reverger通过支持发散与收敛的灵活迭代，显著提升了创意探索的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas
(divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent
combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are
often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools
(CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and
convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate
variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding
flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool
enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for
modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows
users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into
concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence
until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that
Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse
high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that
they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在教育工具中的普及，研究其交互方式对用户表现的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，15名高中生分别在三种交互方式下完成编程任务，分析任务完成时间和用户反馈。

Result: 协作交互方式显著优于被动和主动方式，任务完成时间更短，用户满意度更高。

Conclusion: LLMs的交互设计应注重互动性和用户中心化，尤其是对新手程序员。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and
programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should
interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles
with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance
on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where
fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under
three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a
specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions
automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative
analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly
improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions.
Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when
working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an
LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact
learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing
LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive,
adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.

Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from
the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the
Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the
introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0),
challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading
researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots
must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims
to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from
short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level
needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI,
this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs
called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of
human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot
effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with
robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Motivation: 化妆对自我表达和自信至关重要，但现有辅助工具未能满足视力障碍者在化妆过程中的复杂需求。

Method: 通过15名视力障碍化妆用户的实地调查和5名专业化妆师的访谈，分析了化妆行为和信息需求。

Result: 研究发现视力障碍者依赖触觉策略，面临对称性和评估挑战，需要实时反馈。

Conclusion: 提出了非视觉化妆反馈需求的分类，并设计了未来辅助系统的方向，支持独立化妆实践。

Abstract: Makeup plays a vital role in self-expression, identity, and confidence - yet
remains an underexplored domain for assistive technology, especially for people
with vision impairments. While existing tools support isolated tasks such as
color identification or product labeling, they rarely address the procedural
complexity of makeup routines: coordinating step sequences, managing product
placement, and assessing the final look with accessible feedback. To understand
the real-world process, we conducted a contextual inquiry with 15 visually
impaired makeup users, capturing real-time makeup application behaviors and
their step-by-step information needs and assessment approaches. Our findings
reveal embodied, tactile-first strategies; persistent challenges in blending,
symmetry, and assessment; and a desire for honest, real-time, goal-aligned
feedback. We also interviewed five professional makeup artists, who reviewed
participant makeup videos and provided expert responses to participant-raised
questions and assessment practices. We contribute a taxonomy of feedback needs
in non-visual makeup, and outline design implications for future assistive
systems - emphasizing hands-free, conversational interaction and context-aware,
procedural support for expressive and independent beauty practices.

### [684] [Infrastructuring Contestability: A Framework for Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05187)
*Andreas Mayer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CDAVP的社会技术框架，旨在解决AI系统中用户代理和价值多元化的缺失问题，通过社区定义的价值配置和动态生态系统实现价值协商。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的价值对齐方法缺乏用户和社区的参与，导致用户代理丧失和信任危机，亟需一种新框架来解决这一问题。

Method: CDAVP框架允许社区定义和维护明确的价值配置，用户可动态激活这些配置，AI系统透明解释并调解冲突。

Result: CDAVP通过社区参与和动态价值协商，增强了算法的可问责性和用户代理，实现了更具人性化的AI系统。

Conclusion: CDAVP为价值多元化和用户代理提供了一种可行的解决方案，是实现可争议、以人为本的AI的必要路径。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
(CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value
pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,
top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This
leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded
in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy
and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),
a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design
problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic
ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables
diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value
profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only
preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are
then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control
(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,
are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,
adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The
designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect
of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a
necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and
genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，仅降低限速不足以有效减少车速，街道设计对限速遵守至关重要。通过计算机视觉和机器学习分析，窄街和高密度建筑环境有助于降低车速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过街道设计提高30公里/小时限速的遵守率，以增强道路安全和可持续交通。

Method: 利用计算机视觉语义分割模型分析Google街景图像，并结合机器学习预测车速。

Result: 窄街和高密度建筑环境降低车速，而开阔视野和更大天空视野则增加车速。方法在米兰、阿姆斯特丹和迪拜验证有效。

Conclusion: 街道设计对限速遵守至关重要，机器学习模型为城市规划者提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h
to 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote
sustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these
new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates
drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how
street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that
the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving
speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can
improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply
computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View
images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built
environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater
visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the
influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed
methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to
Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and
Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric
design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in
Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines
for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a
machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street
characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the
compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed
limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners,
supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: TopoMAS是一个交互式人机框架，通过多智能体系统加速拓扑材料的发现流程，结合动态知识图谱和人类专家协作，成功识别新拓扑相SrSbO3，并在计算效率上显著优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑材料的跨尺度设计因低效的发现流程而受限，需要一种更高效的方法来加速材料发现。

Method: TopoMAS结合用户定义查询、多源数据检索、理论推断、晶体结构生成和第一性原理验证，并通过动态知识图谱持续优化知识。

Result: TopoMAS成功识别新拓扑相SrSbO3，并在计算效率和准确性上优于其他大型语言模型。

Conclusion: TopoMAS不仅推动了拓扑材料的研究，还为材料科学领域提供了一个可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to
their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale
design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we
introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive
human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery
pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through
theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles
validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating
computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous
knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already
guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by
first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust
adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B
model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens
required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses
twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an
accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational
agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not
only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes
a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.

Motivation: 提升符号音乐理解的性能，通过设计新的预训练目标来更好地捕捉音乐知识。

Method: 设计了两种预训练目标：标记校正（对噪声标记进行去噪）和钢琴卷预测（从噪声标记预测钢琴卷表示）。

Result: 在12个下游任务中表现优异，验证了预训练目标的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的预训练目标能有效提升模型在符号音乐理解任务中的性能。

Abstract: We propose a pre-trained BERT-like model for symbolic music understanding
that achieves competitive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks.
To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely
token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note
tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the
model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to
predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the
corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better
learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we
propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord
estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合视觉特征（面部表情和动作）与文本提示，提升音乐生成的表达力和时间准确性。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（PEFT）对预训练文本到音乐模型进行微调，引入时间平滑策略对齐多模态数据。

Result: 生成的音乐在音乐性、创造力、节奏一致性、视频时间对齐和文本遵循方面优于基线方法和现有视频到音乐生成模型。

Conclusion: Expotion展示了多模态控制在音乐生成中的潜力，并提供了一个新的同步视频数据集，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal
Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls -
specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a
novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing
expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and
interactive music generation.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Audio-JEPA是一种基于JEPA框架的自监督学习方法，专为音频数据设计，通过预测掩码频谱块的潜在表示而非原始音频重建，性能与wav2vec 2.0和data2vec相当，但训练数据量更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对音频数据的自监督学习需求，提出Audio-JEPA，旨在高效预测掩码频谱块的潜在表示，减少训练数据依赖。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer骨干网络，在未标记的AudioSet片段上预训练，通过随机掩码mel频谱块预测潜在表示。

Result: 在X-ARES测试套件中表现与wav2vec 2.0和data2vec相当，但仅用不到五分之一的训练数据且无需超参数调优。

Conclusion: Audio-JEPA是一种高效的自监督音频表示学习方法，性能优越且资源需求低，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a
recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations
of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data.
Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent
representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw
audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch
masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a
straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still
show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than
one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code
and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: RECA-PD是一种新型、鲁棒且可解释的交叉注意力架构，用于基于语音的帕金森病早期检测，性能与最先进模型相当，同时提供更一致且临床意义更强的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）影响全球超过1000万人，语音障碍常早于运动症状数年出现，因此语音成为早期、非侵入性检测的重要模态。现有深度学习模型虽准确率高，但缺乏临床所需的可解释性。

Method: 提出RECA-PD架构，结合可解释的语音特征与自监督表示，通过交叉注意力机制实现高性能和可解释性。此外，通过分段处理长录音缓解某些语音任务（如独白）的性能下降。

Result: RECA-PD在语音检测PD方面达到最先进性能，同时提供更一致且临床相关的解释。研究表明性能与可解释性并非互斥。

Conclusion: RECA-PD为PD早期检测提供了高性能和可解释性的解决方案。未来工作将提升解释对非专家的可用性，并探索严重程度估计以增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度学习技术显著提升了语音情感识别的泛化能力和精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data
analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different
methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle
emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article,
we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to
bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory
perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a
novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques.
MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and
spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to
highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle
variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge
performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS,
89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO.
Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high
precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep
Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse
datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment
in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

Conclusion: 研究旨在澄清音乐生成AI的开放性概念，推动其透明和负责任的发展。

Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite
significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical
ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along
with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the
importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI
Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled
as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In
this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for
assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of
110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we
refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13
openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is
fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work,
we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote
its transparent and responsible development.

Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary
on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano
performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical
expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation
that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based
architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the
traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in
continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous
values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal
usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions
with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the
influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic
dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with
different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new
environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two
baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical
analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and
introduces an overestimation bias.

Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and
speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion.
The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an
important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used
independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically
addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that
aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme
sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on
disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these
factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms
using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours,
phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for
intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks
using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the
proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high
intelligibility and speaker similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲-巴西Maracatu传统音乐的复杂节奏模式对传统模型提出了挑战，需要更高效的方法来减少标注工作量并提高性能。

Method: 采用两种预训练网络架构（分别用于起始点检测和节拍跟踪），并通过分层再训练策略对五种传统打击乐器进行微调。

Result: 在最佳情况下，F1分数达到0.998，性能提升超过50个百分点，跨任务适应对时间保持乐器尤为有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为音乐信息检索提供了更高效的工具，适用于非西方音乐背景，强调了乐器特定适应策略的重要性。

Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the
Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns
that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network
architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for
beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per
instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies
for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up
to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage
points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly
effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat
positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument,
highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This
approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions,
offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation
effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive
music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.

Conclusion: LAPS-Diff在提升合成歌唱的自然性和表现力方面具有显著优势，尤其在声乐风格和音高变化的捕捉上。

Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements
in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches.
However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and
language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in
low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion
model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided
learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We
curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract
word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation.
Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to
compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness
and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal
style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec
models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional
priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on
objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff
significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the
considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is
typical of the low resource scenario.

Result: 部分用例效果显著（如提示评估任务准确率提升至64.0%），部分改进有限。

Conclusion: DSPy能提升LLM性能，但效果依赖任务特性，需针对性评估。

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This
study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization
framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five
use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code
generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how
prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases
demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use
case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed
notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a
substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the
router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and
of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was
explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,
using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.
Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt
optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning
and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by
task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt
optimization research.

### [698] [Efficient Detection of Intermittent Job Failures Using Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04173)
*Henri Aïdasso,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少样本学习（FSL）的新方法，用于检测持续集成中的间歇性任务失败，解决了现有启发式方法因误标而性能受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续集成中的间歇性任务失败（如不稳定测试或基础设施问题）难以区分，现有基于机器学习的启发式方法因误标问题在实践中效果不佳。

Method: 通过少样本学习（FSL）微调小型语言模型，生成丰富的日志嵌入，再训练分类器，仅需少量手动标注样本。

Result: 在5个工业项目和1个开源项目中，FSL方法F1分数达70-88%，优于现有方法的34-52%。

Conclusion: 研究表明数据质量比数量更重要，并提出了一种更高效、实用的间歇性任务失败检测框架。

Abstract: One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous
integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job
failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky
tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such
as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large
datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or
regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on
non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job
failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not
an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In
fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1
open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job
failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using
few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model
using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich
embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based
approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,
outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4
projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over
quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the
detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述分析了37项研究，探讨了LLM助手对软件开发生产力的影响，发现其既有显著益处（如加速开发）也有风险（如降低协作）。研究多关注满意度、性能和效率，但沟通和活动维度研究不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开发者广泛采用LLM助手，缺乏对其如何影响生产力的综合理解，因此需要系统梳理现有研究。

Method: 对2014年至2024年的37项同行评审研究进行系统文献综述，分析LLM助手对开发生产力的多维影响。

Result: LLM助手能减少代码搜索时间、加速开发，但也可能导致认知卸载和团队协作减少。研究多聚焦满意度、性能和效率，沟通和活动研究较少。

Conclusion: LLM助手对开发生产力有复杂影响，未来需更多纵向和团队研究，以更全面评估其效果。

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to
transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these
tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and
design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how
LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we
present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published
between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis
reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical
risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated
development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,
studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team
collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of
studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two
SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer
productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial
room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency
are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and
Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and
methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.
This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future
research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly

use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like
BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular
for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop
word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising
after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software
projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug
localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on
specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation
metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold
cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust
statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to
provide useful insights for practitioners.

Motivation: 理解细胞形态、基因表达和空间组织如何共同影响组织功能是生物学中的核心挑战。现有机器学习方法通常孤立或低分辨率分析这些模态。

Method: SPATIA通过跨注意力融合细胞形态和转录组信息，并使用Transformer模块在多个尺度上捕获空间依赖性，同时结合生成扩散模型合成高分辨率细胞图像。

Result: SPATIA在12个任务中优于13个现有模型，能够生成反映转录组扰动的真实细胞形态。

Conclusion: SPATIA为整合多模态空间转录组数据提供了统一框架，显著提升了性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

Motivation: 传统射线追踪方法依赖于环境模型和电磁特性的准确性，而计算机视觉和机器学习的进步使得重建详细的环境模型成为可能。本文旨在结合这些技术，提出一种更高效的模拟方法。

Method: 使用可微分射线追踪模拟器，直接在点云上操作，模拟多路径传播（包括镜面反射和漫散射），并利用语义标签学习环境的电磁特性。

Result: 在两个室内场景中，模拟了最多五次交互的多路径传播，每次模拟时间少于90毫秒，展示了高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效模拟多路径传播，还能通过可微分计算结合语义标签学习环境电磁特性，为无线电传播模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation
simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The
accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its
electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine
learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models
augmented with semantic segmentation labels.
  In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio
propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the
efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up
to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two
indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate
how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with
segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.

Motivation: 当前AI系统的高计算成本和功耗限制了其广泛部署和扩展，现有硬件方法面临效率瓶颈。

Method: ZettaLith通过放弃通用GPU应用，采用多种协同设计的架构创新，基于成熟的数字电子技术实现高效能。

Result: 预计到2027年，单个ZettaLith机架可实现1.507 zettaFLOPS，性能提升1047倍，能效提升1490倍，成本效益提升2325倍。

Conclusion: ZettaLith为AI推理提供了一种高效、低成本且可扩展的解决方案，适用于从桌面到移动设备的不同规模系统。

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated
AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further
scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This
paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to
reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current
GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections,
a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 -
representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x
better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current
leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture
achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via
the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations
using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper.
ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS
desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x
advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the
complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively

Motivation: 现有PEFT框架在多适配器场景下存在GPU资源浪费、资源管理不灵活、隐私保护不足等问题。

Method: 采用分离执行技术，将客户端特定适配器与冻结的基础模型层解耦，实现资源共享和灵活管理。

Result: 在Llama2-13B上的评估显示，Symbiosis在相同GPU和时间下可微调4倍多的适配器。

Conclusion: Symbiosis为多适配器场景提供了高效、灵活且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the
task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the
original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to
creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or
fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,
each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in
excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular
inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow
independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They
cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and
fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to
expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we
address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.
The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning
processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of
client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering
them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,
to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and
works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our
evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can
fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Conclusion: 研究为自动口音分析和发音建模提供了新见解，对语音处理应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory
features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare
phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based
references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength.
The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory
inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of
read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines
correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength
proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent
strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two
dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back
vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory
modeling for speech processing applications.

Conclusion: MMMOS在多领域音频质量评估中显著优于基线方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating
audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive
assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging
diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose
MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that
estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity,
Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and
environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained
encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with
four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30%
reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus
baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and
ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant
substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals
coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a
single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts
the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that
translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this
mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons
and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,
linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,
while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by
shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive
or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of
calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition
suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold
of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting
accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and
flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators
could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively
modulating the synaptic weight updates.

*Mohid Farooqi,Alejandro Comas-Leon*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文提出LILITH架构，通过模拟大脑多区域化学信号通信，探索意识涌现的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI范式局限于神经元层面的前馈网络，扩展至多脑区域化学信号层面可能有助于理解意识涌现。

Method: LILITH结合模块化语言模型的发育训练与类脑令牌通信协议，模拟大脑区域分工与信号传递。

Result: 该框架支持通过信息整合理论直接实证研究意识涌现，并提供模块间信号模式的独特见解。

Conclusion: LILITH为意识研究提供新视角，但实现仍面临巨大挑战。

Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward
networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that
expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be
a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We
propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of
modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication
protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models
distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory,
sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent
token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike
traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training
where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences,
developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental
interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct
empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information
Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module
signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness
emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into
different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates,
contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics.
The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the
substantial challenges in implementing such a system.

Method: 基于文献，提出了四种评估框架：VITs、无金标准评估、联合检测与量化任务评估、多维参数输出评估。

Result: 这些框架为QI方法的评估提供了实用工具，但各有局限性。

Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple
clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective
evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need,
multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on
previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation
studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials
(VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation
framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a
framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks
is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output
multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these
frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine
future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent
advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the
development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks
in the context of PET.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM4Hint，利用中等规模LLM生成查询优化提示，通过轻量级模型、查询重写策略和匹配提示提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需手动调优，学习型方法泛化能力有限，LLM的成功启发其用于优化器增强。

Method: 结合轻量级模型生成软提示、查询重写策略和匹配提示，降低LLM推理延迟和微调成本。

Result: LLM4Hint在效果和泛化能力上优于现有学习型优化器。

Conclusion: LLM4Hint通过LLM理解查询的能力，显著提升优化器性能，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS,
and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances
in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome
hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face
limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large
Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how
LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.
Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly
including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost
and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token
sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical
features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to
alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint}
that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization
hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model
to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the
SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously
reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting
strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the
backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit
matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight
model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show
that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the
query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in
terms of both effectiveness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统vug识别方法存在主观性强、劳动密集和参数调整不灵活的问题，亟需自动化解决方案以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 采用六步法：top-k模式提取、自适应阈值、轮廓识别、聚合、高级过滤及可选低vug区域过滤，结合统计分析和数据预处理。

Result: 模型验证显示其准确性优于专家手动标注，并提供了vug数量、均值和标准差等详细指标。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升了vug识别的效率和准确性，有助于更好地理解储层特性。

Abstract: Image logs are crucial in capturing high-quality geological information about
subsurface formations. Among the various geological features that can be
gleaned from Formation Micro Imager log, vugs are essential for reservoir
evaluation. This paper introduces an automated Vug Detection Model, leveraging
advanced computer vision techniques to streamline the vug identification
process. Manual and semiautomated methods are limited by individual bias,
labour-intensity and inflexibility in parameter finetuning. Our methodology
also introduces statistical analysis on vug characteristics. Pre-processing
steps, including logical file extraction and normalization, ensured
standardized and usable data. The sixstep vug identification methodology
encompasses top-k mode extraction, adaptive thresholding, contour
identification, aggregation, advanced filtering, and optional filtering for low
vuggy regions. The model's adaptability is evidenced by its ability to identify
vugs missed by manual picking undertaken by experts. Results demonstrate the
model's accuracy through validation against expert picks. Detailed metrics,
such as count, mean, and standard deviation of vug areas within zones, were
introduced, showcasing the model's capabilities compared to manual picking. The
vug area distribution plot enhances understanding of vug types in the
reservoir. This research focuses on the identification and characterization of
vugs that in turn aids in the better understanding of reservoirs.

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural
variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex
scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce
AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable
generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines
a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics
system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned
distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code
generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The
system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering
ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular
genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration
reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export.
We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user
study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM-MAS在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但其通信和协调中的安全风险尚未充分研究。

Method: 设计了四种攻击范式，并在集中式、分散式和分层通信结构中进行评估；提出心理学检测框架AgentXposed，结合HEXACO人格模型和Reid技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击具有强破坏性，检测框架能有效识别恶意行为，但意图隐藏攻击的检测率略低于基线。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了意图隐藏攻击的结构和行为风险，为通过心理学视角保障LLM-MAS安全提供了见解。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit
strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and
coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically
investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four
representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while
maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized,
decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on
six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic,
and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities.
To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework
AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid
Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based
monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our
detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors.
The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that
of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal
the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer
valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through
psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of
multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解集体行为中的领导动态是动物生态学、群体机器人和智能交通的关键挑战，传统方法在噪声或短数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 利用速度、加速度和方向等多变量时间滞后相关性构建动态影响图，无需大量数据或参数敏感离散化。

Result: 在多智能体模拟中验证，网络方法在有限时空观测下优于传统方法，更一致地识别真实领导者。

Conclusion: 动态网络推断方法在领导关系识别中具有优势，尤其适用于数据有限或噪声环境。

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge
in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional
information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and
Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer
leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or
short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability
estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference
using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,
acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs
over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need
for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate
our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek
model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and
independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the
network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited
spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence
metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害频发，机场在救灾中成为瓶颈，信息不对称和资源不足是主要问题，需研究其对操作性能的影响。

Method: 创建基于代理的模型，模拟不同信息不确定性下的资源分配策略，并进行专家校准与验证。

Result: 单个未计划飞机影响可忽略，但多架未计划飞机会显著增加等待时间。

Conclusion: 信息不对称和资源不足对机场救灾操作性能有显著影响，需优化资源分配策略以减少等待时间。

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many
people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important
hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the
airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden
need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational
side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,
first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,
and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand
the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource
allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an
airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing
realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information
uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in
the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,
which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting
times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are
negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned
aircraft.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent
systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability,
robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world
tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable,
or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing
next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire,
an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI
teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated
wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial
observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The
environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language
interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and
evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks,
uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges
in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon
planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable
architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a
critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Method: 采用冻结文本嵌入和简单多层感知器分类器的轻量级流程，在集中式和联邦式配置下进行实验，测试了六种嵌入模型和三种分类器架构。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了构建可扩展、隐私保护的医疗编码系统的可行路径，并为未来联邦学习和领域自适应临床AI研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning
(FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the
MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training
or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable
pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and
deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly
suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both
centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly
available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard
and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits
assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially
outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that
federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized
conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than
state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1
scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the
simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way
toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step
toward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI.

Result: 数学专业化和长推理能力导致检索性能下降，视觉语言和代码专业化模型在零样本检索中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为跨领域和跨模态融合的统一检索任务提供了方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense
retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval
effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines
how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities,
an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling
text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments
with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned,
code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across
zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot
retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code
retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance,
all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical
specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation
in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and
semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs
demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even
surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance
to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising
directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and
cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Although the amount of available spoken content is steadily increasing,

propose a novel navigational method for speech archives that leverages recent
advances in language and multimodal generative models. We demonstrate our
approach with a Web application that organizes data into a structured format
using interactive mind maps and image generation tools. The system is
implemented using the TED-LIUM~3 dataset, which comprises over 2,000 speech
transcripts and audio files of TED Talks. Initial user tests using a System

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic
representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential
recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,
while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.
Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to
improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing
that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale
corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and
fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We
attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute
features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that
compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions
(e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of
specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at

Abstract: Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A
common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to
enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these
combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful
feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While
feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically
limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for
high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due
to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature
combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{TayFCS}$, a
lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves
model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer
(TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead
of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly
running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to
approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can
be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation
model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and
their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which
estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction
performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test
results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start
problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on
transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the
target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the
underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain
alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target
domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space
distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal
data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first
employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features
and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt
learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion
module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This
approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and
understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping
users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature
vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of
cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the
Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SBR模型忽视会话间关系和语义细节，导致性能受限。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIPHOP通过语义学习和意图引导优化，有效提升会话推荐质量。

Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will
likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous
session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,
ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some
methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and
irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on
item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their
ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable
LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.
First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models
(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item
embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item
transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing
module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we
design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user
intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively
exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an
intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.
Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive
learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available:

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of
wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and
complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial
intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and
utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks
(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting
their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we
propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the
structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly
apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to
wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language
model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI
tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats
compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt
extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI
through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human
activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI
achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an
improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%
reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN
design.

Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner
has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have
for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while
efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of
designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and
target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior
knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is
in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each
SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias
towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less
informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general
prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of
constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer
guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression
with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$
rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to
the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real
datasets support the theory.

Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions,
their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has
shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time
discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to
autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first
introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and
learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those
established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved
upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching
performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and
corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with
up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training
steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC
transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the
analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the
computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and
generation.

Motivation: 共形预测（CP）作为一种不确定性表示技术，其作为UQ工具的概念地位尚不明确，本文旨在通过范畴论方法澄清其内在结构特性。

Conclusion: CP的结构特性使其成为强大的UQ工具，且在隐私保护中具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that
delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine
Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has
remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP --
framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined
categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal
assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities
are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges
(and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic
approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a
conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This
observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added
locally does not break coverage.
