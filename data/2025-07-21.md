Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDNIG是一种基于U-Net的新型深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强，通过引入亮度图和SPP模块提升性能，并在GAN框架中优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强问题，提升模型在多样化光照条件下的表现。

Method: 结合U-Net架构，引入亮度图（BCP）和SPP模块，使用Swish激活函数，并在GAN框架中优化。

Result: 在定量指标和视觉质量上表现优异，模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG适合实际应用，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

### [3] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂视觉任务中表现优异，但在简单感知测试中表现不佳。研究发现，这些模型在非局部视觉推理（如比较感知、扫视搜索和连续视觉搜索）上表现较差，甚至低于人类随机准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs在非局部视觉推理任务中的能力，揭示其在核心视觉推理上的不足。

Method: 设计了三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索、连续视觉搜索），测试主流模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Vision 3.7、GPT-o4-mini）的表现。

Result: 主流模型在这些任务中表现不佳，甚至低于人类随机准确率，表明其在核心视觉推理能力上的缺失。

Conclusion: 尽管VLMs在原始视觉敏锐度上有所提升，但仍缺乏核心视觉推理能力，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

### [4] [Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13362)
*Binbin Ji,Siddharth Agrawal,Qiance Tang,Yvonne Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习改进性能。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而GRPO强化学习方法优于监督微调（SFT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLMs的空间推理能力，并解决SFT在泛化性上的不足。

Method: 使用SceneGraph CoT提示策略和GRPO强化学习方法，在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估性能。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估和OOD条件下表现优于SFT，泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习能有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化性，GRPO优于SFT。代码已开源。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

### [5] [Just Add Geometry: Gradient-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection Without Human-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13363)
*Atharv Goel,Mehar Khurana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用2D视觉语言模型进行开放词汇3D物体检测，无需人工标注3D标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检测数据集类别有限且标注成本高，而2D视觉语言模型具有丰富的语义理解和开放词汇能力。

Method: 通过2D视觉语言检测器生成文本条件提案，结合SAM分割和3D反投影，利用几何膨胀策略推断3D边界框。

Result: 在多种设置下（如LiDAR和RGB-D输入）实现竞争性定位性能，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Method: 采用模态专用分词器、共享Transformer架构和跨注意力机制，提出迭代模态切换预训练策略和模态对训练算法。

Result: 在12种模态的25个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练方法在多模态场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeCoFuse是一个统一的框架，用于解决异构传感器配置下的V2X协同感知问题，通过层次化融合机制和自适应学习策略，显著提升了感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统因传感器配置异构性导致特征融合和感知可靠性问题，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用层次化融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，结合动态调整的协同学习策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse成为当前TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最先进方法，展示了在异构传感器部署中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

*Hsiang-Hui Hung,Huu-Phu Do,Yung-Hui Li,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间下渲染新视图，即使在输入视图较少的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多视图采集成本高且对未见场景重新优化效率低。元宇宙等数字领域对自然昼夜过渡的3D环境建模需求迫切，而现有NeRF技术在时间维度上的探索有限。

Method: 结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场，支持任意时间的神经辐射场建模，并通过体积渲染合成新视图。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，尤其擅长平滑过渡不同时间的自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF为时间维度的3D场景建模提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有目标检测架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和计算效率之间的平衡问题，特别是在自动驾驶动态环境中。

Method: 提出Butter框架，包含频率自适应特征一致性增强（FAFCE）组件和渐进式层次特征融合网络（PHFFNet）模块，分别优化特征一致性和语义融合。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上表现出色，检测精度显著提升，同时模型复杂度降低。

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化和融合，在自动驾驶实时场景中实现了精度、可部署性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving
community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集文本标注方法虽然能达到75.9%的召回率，但需要昂贵的离线处理，且会遗漏34%的视觉信息（如场景文本）。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图，预测信息需求，动态路由查询到ASR、OCR和视觉索引，平均每查询使用1.78种模态。

Result: 在180万视频片段上的评估显示，智能路由减少了基础设施成本，同时保持了实际部署的竞争力。

Conclusion: ModaRoute为多模态检索系统提供了一种可扩展的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了工业缺陷检测领域从封闭集到开放集方法的演变，重点分析了2D和3D模态下的技术进展、挑战及新兴趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业缺陷检测方法在精度、自动化和可扩展性方面难以满足现实需求，而计算机视觉和深度学习的进步推动了该领域的发展，尤其是开放集方法的兴起。

Result: 开放集方法在减少缺陷标注需求和识别新异常方面表现出显著优势，成为当前研究的重要方向。

Conclusion: 该综述为工业缺陷检测领域提供了全面的技术视角，并指出了开放集方法的未来潜力。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在卫星图像机器学习（SatML）任务中，融合其他地理数据层如何提升模型性能，特别是在数据有限和跨区域预测时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数SatML模型仅针对光学输入设计，忽略了其他地理数据层的潜在价值。

Method: 通过将额外的地理数据层附加到基准数据集上，生成增强版任务，并比较不同融合策略的效果。

Result: 融合其他地理数据显著提升了模型性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域预测时；硬编码融合策略优于学习策略。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML模型的数据效率和泛化能力具有重要价值，未来研究可进一步探索融合策略。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

Method: 提出了一种基于二值占用的框架，将预测过程分解为二值和语义占用模块，以有效利用二值占用数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在预训练和自动标注任务中均优于现有方法，显著提升了3D语义占用预测的效果。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型InSyn，用于精确预测行人轨迹，通过显式捕捉多样化的交互模式（如同步或冲突）和方向敏感的社会行为，同时引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖相对位置建模行人交互，但忽略了特定交互模式（如配对行走或冲突行为），导致在拥挤场景中预测精度受限。

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上显著优于基线模型，尤其是在高密度场景中；SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn模型和SSOS策略有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，特别是在复杂交互场景中。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Result: MADI显著提升了扩散模型的编辑能力和结构化生成效果。

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用上下文生成架构中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的3D主动脉构建对临床诊断和CFD模拟至关重要，但现有方法依赖大标注数据集且难以生成几何一致的表面。

Method: AortaDiff使用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，几何保真度高。

Conclusion: AortaDiff是一种端到端、低依赖标注数据的实用解决方案，适用于心血管研究。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准很少测试视觉蕴含推理能力，特别是在拥挤场景中，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608张图像和合成的真假陈述对，基于CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 顶级视觉语言模型准确率低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: 当前模型在拥挤场景的视觉蕴含推理能力存在显著不足。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Motivation: 解决肩部骨折在急诊和高流量临床环境中漏诊率高的问题，利用AI技术提升早期检测能力。

Method: 采用多模型深度学习系统（如Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet等），结合边界框和分类级集成技术（如Soft-NMS、WBF等）优化检测。

Result: NMW集成模型表现最佳，准确率95.5%，F1分数0.9610，召回率和定位精度均优异。

Conclusion: 基于集成的AI系统能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断流程，但当前仅支持二元骨折检测，适用于快速筛查而非详细分类。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Result: 分割精度IoU超过85%，整体检测准确率达90%，并发现四个新遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合历史影像在考古遗址发现中具有突破性意义，尤其适用于因人为活动而消失的遗址。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Motivation: 当前方法在建模复杂时空依赖和人类驾驶行为不可预测性方面存在不足，需要更精确的预测模型。

Method: CaSTFormer采用Reciprocal Shift Fusion机制、Causal Pattern Extraction模块和Feature Synthesis Network，分别实现特征对齐、消除虚假相关性和合成时空推理。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上达到最优性能，有效捕捉复杂因果时空依赖。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer显著提升了驾驶意图预测的准确性和模型透明度。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

Motivation: 摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，需要一种自监督且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 通过自校准方法，利用可靠的多视角点（n≥6）和MVS阶段的相关线索（如匹配成本值）回归视差不确定性。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架填补了MVS阶段不确定性估计的空白，为摄影测量过程提供了可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream

introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized

in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The normal vector is considered as a manifold-valued
function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous
discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a
Raviart-Thomas function space. To exctend this formulation to the manifold
setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods
in mesh denoising experiments.

Result: NABLA在训练和推理上比基线快2.7倍，且几乎不影响生成质量和量化指标。

Conclusion: NABLA是一种高效且无需定制低层操作设计的注意力机制，适用于视频生成任务。

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，合成重放方法生成的样本可能因未捕捉领域细节和细粒度语义而导致知识保留不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用LoRA增强的合成重放框架，通过两阶段置信度样本选择优化生成样本的代表性和质量。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中，该方法优于现有合成重放技术，平衡了可塑性、稳定性和零样本能力。

Conclusion: LoRA适配生成器的方法显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF方法有效解决了噪声点云下的表面重建问题，为3D神经场的去噪提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有确定性方法生成的超分辨率图像模糊且感知质量差，需改进为清晰高保真图像。

Method: 采用扩散模型结合高效随机采样器（高阶ODE）和一步扩散知识蒸馏。

Result: 运行时间降至基线的1.6%，同时保持图像失真和感知质量。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且能生成高质量超分辨率图像。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式思维推理能力，需要结构化标注支持逐步推理。

Method: CoTasks将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取四个基础任务，并将中间推理步骤嵌入输入。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B分别提升了3.3和17.4分，尤其在因果、时序和描述性子类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化CoT监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人技术中，从移动相机视角分离静态和动态物体对3D重建、自主导航和场景理解至关重要，但现有方法依赖光流，难以处理复杂结构化场景。

Method: FoELS通过计算光流的扩张焦点（FoE）并利用其异常值生成初始运动概率，再结合分割先验估计最终运动概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频上的评估表明，该方法在复杂场景、旋转相机运动和平行运动等挑战下表现优异。

Conclusion: FoELS通过整合光流和纹理信息，显著提升了动态物体检测的性能，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和SMPL的混合模型因变形方案计算成本高而推理速度慢，EPSilon旨在通过优化采样策略提升效率。

Method: EPSilon采用ERO和EIO两种策略，分别省略空射线和空区间，减少无效采样点，从而降低计算成本。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合模型的训练和推理效率，为3D头像生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Conclusion: EvReID数据集和TriPro-ReID框架为未来研究提供了数据和基准支持。

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Conclusion: PW-FNet展示了小波-傅里叶处理在图像恢复中的潜力，为高效恢复方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

Result: 实验表明，MaskHOI显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升了3D手-物体交互姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、低成本的视觉运动测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Motivation: 现有的GOSPA和T-GOSPA度量在多目标跟踪评估中存在对称性和固定惩罚成本的限制，无法满足某些应用需求。

Result: 通过仿真实验，使用T-GOSPA准度量评估了多种贝叶斯MOT算法的性能。

Conclusion: 新准度量提供了更灵活的评估方式，适用于特定应用场景中的MOT算法评估。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的普及，理解StyleGAN的工作原理及其潜在滥用风险变得尤为重要。

Method: 使用PyTorch框架训练StyleGAN模型，通过修剪权重和详细分析潜在向量来研究其行为。

Result: 研究发现大量权重可被修剪而不显著影响输出，且潜在向量能精确控制生成的面部特征。

Conclusion: StyleGAN的技术能力带来了学术价值，但也凸显了其被滥用于伪造身份等伦理问题。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Motivation: 少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）面临数据稀缺和灾难性遗忘的挑战，需有效利用预训练生成模型的能力。

Method: 采用冻结的扩散模型作为主干，提取多尺度互补特征作为潜在重放，结合少量特征蒸馏防止生成偏差。

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL通过冻结主干和高效特征提取，实现了少样本类增量学习的高效和性能提升。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成高质量视频时存在画面闪烁和伪影问题，需改进视觉质量和运动一致性。

Result: 实验表明EVS在视觉和运动质量上优于现有方法，推理速度提升1.6x-4.5x。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在高光谱图像重建中难以准确捕捉高频细节，因此需要一种新方法来提升细节恢复能力。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习光谱扩散先验（SDP），并设计光谱先验注入模块（SPIM）动态指导模型恢复细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet两种代表性HSI方法上的实验表明，该方法性能优于现有网络约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: 提出的SDP和SPIM能有效提升HSI重建性能，尤其在细节恢复方面表现突出。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

Motivation: 在图像分类中，当可解释性和计算效率优先于深度学习的百万参数模型时，特征工程仍至关重要。本文旨在探索一种轻量且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 将PE扩展到二维图像，提出多尺度、多方向的熵特征提取方法，结合HOG和LBP特征，形成780维特征集，用SVM分类器进行训练和优化。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST、KMNIST、EMNIST和CIFAR-10等数据集上表现出竞争性分类性能，无需依赖深度学习架构。

Conclusion: PE与HOG和LBP的融合提供了一种紧凑、可解释且高效的图像分类方法，为轻量化和可解释的机器学习解决方案提供了潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Method: 引入 ClearVQA 基准，针对 VQA 中三类常见模糊性，覆盖多种场景。

Result: ClearVQA 填补了交互式澄清评估的空白，并提供了更全面的模糊性分类。

Conclusion: ClearVQA 为 VQA 中的交互式澄清研究提供了新方向和工具。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Conclusion: 显式可微分聚类模块是一种简单而有效的策略，能够显著提升半监督学习和无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular

Result: DynFaceRestore在定量和定性评估中均达到最优性能，证明了其在盲脸修复中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore通过动态策略有效平衡了保真度与质量，为盲脸修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时间信息融合有效解决了单目方法的局限性，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Motivation: 多模态融合在物联网感知中至关重要，但现有系统面临模型复杂、模态对齐不足和缺失数据鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 结合Mamba模型处理时间序列数据，使用GRAM矩阵优化模态对齐，引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，分别提升了24.5%和23%的性能，同时仅训练少量参数。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA在资源受限环境中实现了高效、鲁棒的多模态感知。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在7个任务的16个数据集上评估，平均性能提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性优化，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for

Method: 使用Quanvolution预处理提取SAR影像中的结构特征，结合Attention U-Net模型进行分割。

Result: 方法在测试精度上与标准Attention U-Net相当，同时显著减少了网络参数。

Conclusion: 量子辅助的深度学习框架在大规模城市建筑分割中具有潜力。

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban
planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting
buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of
quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation
in urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth3DLane提出了一种双路径框架，结合自监督单目深度估计，无需昂贵传感器或额外深度数据，实现3D车道检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D车道检测中缺乏显式空间信息的问题，避免依赖昂贵传感器或大规模真实深度数据，提升在无相机参数场景下的适用性。

Method: 采用双路径框架：鸟瞰路径提取空间信息，前视路径提取语义信息；结合自监督深度网络生成点云，使用3D车道锚点采样特征，并预测相机参数。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中表现优异，且无需相机标定即可应用。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane通过自监督深度估计和双路径设计，实现了高效、灵活的3D车道检测，适用于无相机参数场景。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像定制方法在实体级空间控制上表现不足，限制了实际应用。缺乏绑定身份与精确位置的可扩展数据集是主要原因。

Method: 构建了一个双向生成范式的可扩展合成管道，设计了轻量级位置调制层，解耦空间嵌入以独立控制主体位置。

Result: 实验表明，PositionIC能实现精确的空间控制，同时保持图像定制任务的高一致性。

Conclusion: PositionIC为开放世界多实体场景下的可控高保真图像定制提供了新途径，并将开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Result: 生成了358k高质量三元组数据集NHR-Edit，并在实验中超越了所有公开替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了大规模高质量数据自动化生成，推动了图像编辑领域的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂任务时，常面临内部知识与外部信息冲突的问题，导致幻觉和不可靠响应，但其机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过多模态反事实查询数据集分析冲突机制，使用logit检查定位控制冲突的注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型行为。

Result: 研究发现特定注意力头能控制冲突，修改这些头可引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入，且这些头的注意力定位优于基于梯度的归因方法。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，为模型行为控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

Result: 实验表明PCR-GS在剧烈变化的相机轨迹下表现优异。

Conclusion: PCR-GS显著提升了复杂场景下的3D建模和相机姿态估计性能。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升，验证了视觉基础模型先验在LiDAR 3D目标检测中的价值。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型的深度先验可以有效增强LiDAR点云特征，提升3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

TL;DR: DiViD是一种端到端视频扩散框架，用于显式分离静态外观和动态运动，通过全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌实现，并在解码器中引入关键归纳偏置，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的方法在视频中分离静态和动态信息时存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，DiViD旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: DiViD通过序列编码器提取全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌，解码器采用共享噪声计划、时间变化的KL瓶颈和交叉注意力机制，并引入正交正则化防止泄漏。

Result: DiViD在真实基准测试中表现优异，实现了最高的交换联合准确率，保持静态保真度并提升动态传递，同时减少交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD是首个显式静态-动态分解的视频扩散框架，显著优于现有方法，为视频解缠提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对视频理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解提供了更优的解决方案，验证了VAR框架在此任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual

segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of

evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子辅助网络的超轻量级EIT图像重建框架QuantEIT，显著降低了模型复杂度，并在无监督、无需训练数据的情况下实现了高精度重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT作为一种低成本、高时间分辨率的床边成像技术，其逆问题的不适定性限制了图像重建的准确性。现有深度学习方法依赖复杂网络结构，效率低且难以扩展。

Method: QuantEIT采用量子辅助网络（QA-Net），结合并行2量子比特电路生成隐式非线性先验，再通过单一线性层重建电导率，大幅减少参数数量。

Result: 在模拟和真实2D/3D肺部EIT数据上，QuantEIT仅用0.2%的参数即达到或超越传统方法的精度，且对噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: QuantEIT首次将量子电路引入EIT重建，为高效、轻量化的床边监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

*Qiankun Ma,Ziyao Zhang,Chi Su,Jie Chen,Zhen Song,Hairong Zheng,Wen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba的MTR框架通过结构感知重要性评分实现无训练令牌压缩，显著降低计算量且性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率以扩展应用，发现直接应用ViT的令牌压缩技术会导致性能下降，需针对Mamba特性设计新方法。

Method: 提出MTR框架，基于Mamba结构感知重要性评分，无需训练即可实现令牌压缩。

Result: 在多种任务和骨干网络上显著减少计算量（如Vim-B上FLOPs降低40%），性能损失极小（ImageNet仅下降1.6%）。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、即插即用的Vision Mamba令牌压缩方法，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练基础模型在皮肤病分类中的增量学习潜力，解决传统方法在持续学习中的遗忘问题。

Method: 冻结预训练基础模型的主干网络，逐步训练轻量级MLP；同时探索零训练场景下的原型分类方法。

Result: 提出的方法在CIL任务中表现优异，无需额外正则化或重放机制，且原型分类方法也取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 冻结预训练基础模型在皮肤病持续学习中具有强大潜力，支持其在现实医疗应用中的广泛采用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种视觉对齐的水印框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入可检测水印，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法破坏了视觉-文本对齐，VLA-Mark旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标，动态平衡水印强度和语义保留。

Result: 实验显示PPL降低7.4%，BLEU提高26.6%，检测AUC达98.8%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark在保持多模态一致性的同时，提供了高质量的水印解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

TL;DR: 论文分析了四种匿名化技术对异常检测性能的影响，发现某些技术下模型性能反而提升，强调了隐私保护与检测效用之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但涉及敏感数据收集引发隐私问题，需研究匿名化技术对检测性能的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用模糊、掩码、加密和虚拟形象替换四种匿名化技术，评估四种异常检测方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）下模型性能甚至优于原始数据。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，并比较了传统匿名化技术与隐私设计方案的权衡，为平衡隐私与检测需求提供了基准。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化软件（Carebot AI Bones）用于测量脊柱侧弯的Cobb角，结果显示其与放射科医生的测量结果高度一致，可用于临床工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量Cobb角耗时且存在观察者间差异，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究回顾性评估了Carebot AI Bones软件在103张脊柱X光片上的表现，与两位放射科医生的测量结果进行对比。

Result: AI与放射科医生的测量误差较小（MAE约3.9度），相关性高（Pearson r约0.9），分类一致性中等（Cohen kappa 0.51-0.64）。

Conclusion: 该软件能复现专家水平的测量结果，可用于临床脊柱侧弯的快速评估和分类。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的多视图多目标关联框架，结合图建模和极线几何，在噪声和视觉不可区分条件下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外观特征或几何约束，在目标视觉不可区分或噪声干扰时表现不佳。

Method: C-DOG通过连接delta重叠图建模和极线几何，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差标准，实现鲁棒关联。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于几何基线，并在高目标密度、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠等挑战下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于现实场景中可扩展的3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型多为专有，缺乏透明性，且SSL聚类方法存在语义模糊问题。Franca旨在提供开源高性能模型并改进聚类方法。

Method: 使用透明训练流程，基于公开数据（ImageNet-21K和ReLAION-2B子集），引入多头部聚类投影器和位置解耦策略。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，性能与专有模型相当或更好，特征空间更干净。

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能视觉模型设定了新标准，推动了可复现和通用基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT是一种基于图的架构，用于优化LLM驱动的交通管理任务，解决了现有链式系统的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式系统（如TrafficGPT）在复杂交通场景中效率低下，存在顺序任务执行、高令牌消耗和扩展性差的问题。

Method: 提出GraphTrafficGPT，通过有向图表示任务及其依赖关系，引入Brain Agent分解查询并协调多个专用代理，实现并行执行和动态资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，GraphTrafficGPT比TrafficGPT减少50.2%令牌消耗和19.0%响应延迟，同时支持多查询并行处理，效率提升23.0%。

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT显著提升了LLM在交通管理中的效率和扩展性，适用于复杂城市交通场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

TL;DR: PrefPalette通过分解偏好为属性维度，并基于社会社区价值观进行个性化预测，显著优于GPT-4o，同时提供可解释的社区偏好分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好模型将人类判断视为黑箱，缺乏对偏好背后原因的理解。PrefPalette旨在通过多属性决策原则，实现透明且个性化的偏好建模。

Method: PrefPalette采用两步法：(1)生成合成数据以隔离属性效应；(2)基于注意力的偏好建模，动态学习不同社区对属性的权重分配。

Result: 在45个Reddit社区中，PrefPalette的平均预测准确率比GPT-4o高46.6%，并揭示了社区特定的偏好特征。

Conclusion: PrefPalette不仅提升了偏好预测性能，还提供了透明且可解释的社区偏好分析，为更可信的个性化应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 当前AI主要建模像素和文字，但世界由实体及其关系构成，关系学习（如关系数据库中的数据）更具价值，但未得到足够重视。

Method: 通过分析关系学习的现状和局限性，探讨其未普及的原因。

Result: 关系学习仅在少数受限情况下应用广泛，需进一步研究以提升其重要性。

Conclusion: 关系学习应成为AI的核心方向，需更多研究和技术突破以实现其潜力。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决安全法规文本的复杂性和多跳查询问题，传统RAG系统难以应对。

Method: 引入双图架构（实体网络图和文档导航图），结合图遍历和向量语义搜索。

Result: 在多跳问题数据集上，精确率92.8%，召回率85.5%，F1分数87.3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BifrostRAG为复杂技术文档处理提供了可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于最终答案的自动错误诊断方法，用于解决学生解题步骤组合时的错误诊断问题，验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能辅导系统中学生解题步骤组合导致的错误诊断困难问题。

Method: 通过自动完成中间输入并诊断解决方案，设计基于最终答案的错误诊断服务。

Result: 在二次方程求解数据集上，该方法能诊断29.4%的步骤，与教师诊断结果97%一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为错误诊断提供了新思路，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADPC的新型视觉语言因果干预框架，用于阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断，通过结合多模态数据和因果推理，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD）对延缓痴呆进展至关重要，但现有方法因数据选择偏差和变量间复杂关系而存在挑战。

Method: ADPC利用大型语言模型（LLM）结构化临床数据，结合MRI和fMRI图像，通过因果干预消除混杂因素，实现CN/MCI/AD分类。

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD病例上表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型追踪和约束建模的方法，用于诊断学生在多步任务中的输入，并在实际数据中验证了其与教师诊断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型追踪和约束建模在诊断学生输入时的局限性，尤其是学生将多个步骤合并为一步的情况。

Method: 通过定义约束作为学生输入与策略步骤的共同属性，设计并评估了一个多步策略诊断系统。

Result: 系统诊断与教师编码在所有140个学生步骤中完全一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了两种诊断范式，能够准确识别学生的策略偏差。

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

Motivation: 现有本体可视化工具无法有效展示复杂本体结构，限制了用户对大型本体框架的理解。

Method: OntView基于DL推理器，采用“所见即所意”范式，支持GCI可视化，并提供简化视图功能（如本体摘要、TBox元素聚焦和动态分支隐藏）。

Result: OntView成功实现了直观的本体可视化，解决了信息过载问题，并开源发布。

Conclusion: OntView为复杂本体的可视化提供了有效工具，填补了现有工具的不足。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.
OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级框架，用于动态图中的时间链路预测，通过结合短期时间最近性和长期全局结构模式，显著提高了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T-GNNs在建模时间和结构依赖时计算开销大，效率低，EAGLE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: EAGLE包含时间感知模块和结构感知模块，采用自适应权重机制平衡两者，避免复杂计算。

Result: 在七个真实世界时间图上，EAGLE性能优于现有T-GNNs，速度提升50倍以上。

Conclusion: EAGLE在效率和效果上均优于现有方法，适用于大规模动态图分析。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

Motivation: 传统MARL知识转移方法在非静态环境中泛化能力差，智能体需要高成本重新训练。

Method: 通过因果干预建模碰撞事件，生成恢复动作宏（macro），并在智能体间在线转移，实现零样本适应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能填补随机探索与完全重新训练策略之间约一半的差距，且效果受环境复杂度和智能体目标异质性影响。

Conclusion: 因果知识转移框架为MARL在动态环境中的适应性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI
collaboration.

Conclusion: 为复杂动态系统的高分辨率逻辑推理提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric
resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like
Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon
a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Conclusion: KROMA证明了知识检索、提示增强和本体细化等技术在大规模本体匹配中的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,
yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with
limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker

Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs可显著提升桥梁维护效率与准确性，为基础设施管理提供创新解决方案。

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and
summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and
enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

TL;DR: CUDA-L1是一种基于强化学习的自动化CUDA优化框架，显著提升GPU计算效率，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型对GPU计算资源的需求激增，急需自动化CUDA优化策略。现有模型在CUDA优化上成功率低，因此开发了CUDA-L1。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，通过速度提升作为奖励信号，训练模型优化CUDA内核。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100上平均提速17.7倍，峰值达449倍，且在不同GPU架构上表现优异。

Conclusion: CUDA-L1展示了强化学习在自动化CUDA优化中的潜力，能显著提升GPU效率并减轻资源压力。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视大型多模态模型的语义增强效果和新闻的情感特征，而假新闻更倾向于包含负面情绪。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型生成图像摘要以增强语义理解，并设计专家情感推理模块优化情感特征。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，SEER优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SEER通过语义增强和情感推理有效提升了多模态假新闻检测的性能。

Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application
of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement
effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional
features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to
contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel
Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake
news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic
understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic
enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity
and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that
simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the
authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为ALP的少样本自适应语言提示方法，利用多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro）检测钓鱼网页，显著提升了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击是严重的网络安全威胁，需要自适应检测技术。

Method: ALP是一种结构化语义推理方法，通过分解语言模式、检测紧急信号和识别操纵性措辞，引导大语言模型分析文本欺骗。结合文本、视觉和URL分析，提出统一模型。

Result: 实验表明ALP显著提升钓鱼检测准确率，F1分数达0.93，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALP集成的多模态大语言模型为更鲁棒、可解释和自适应的钓鱼检测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

### [105] [Persona-Based Synthetic Data Generation Using Multi-Stage Conditioning with Large Language Models for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13380)
*Keito Inoshita,Rushia Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaGen是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的新框架，通过多阶段角色条件生成情感丰富的文本，解决了情感识别领域高质量数据集稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感识别领域因高质量、多样化情感数据集的稀缺而面临挑战，情感表达具有主观性，受个体特质、社会文化背景和情境因素影响，大规模数据收集在伦理和实践上均存在困难。

Method: PersonaGen通过结合人口统计属性、社会文化背景和详细情境上下文构建分层虚拟角色，指导情感表达生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，PersonaGen在生成多样、连贯且具有区分性的情感表达方面显著优于基线方法，其合成数据在语义多样性、人类相似性、现实性和下游情感分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PersonaGen展示了作为增强或替代真实情感数据集的潜力，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

### [106] [SAFT: Structure-Aware Fine-Tuning of LLMs for AMR-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13381)
*Rafiq Kamel,Filippo Guerranti,Simon Geisler,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息到预训练的大语言模型（LLMs）中，显著提升了AMR到文本生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理抽象意义表示（AMRs）时，往往忽略图结构信息或与标准LLMs不兼容，限制了性能。

Method: SAFT利用磁拉普拉斯变换计算方向敏感的位置编码，并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间，无需改变模型架构。

Result: SAFT在AMR 3.0上实现了3.5 BLEU的提升，性能增益随图复杂度增加而显著。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了一种通用且有效的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

*Chandrashekar Muniyappa,Sirisha Velampalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图的假新闻检测方法，结合NLP技术和GBAD算法，通过挖掘异常模式来识别假新闻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字世界中假新闻传播迅速，亟需有效方法应对。

Method: 利用NLP将新闻转换为图结构，采用MDL-based GBAD算法进行图挖掘，识别异常模式。

Result: 方法能有效发现假新闻，尤其在COVID-19相关新闻中表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在处理复杂上下文数据时优于传统技术，适用于假新闻检测。

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

TL;DR: PARAM-1是一个专注于印度语言多样性的2.9B参数语言模型，通过双语数据集（印地语和英语）训练，强调公平表示、适应印度形态的标记化和文化对齐评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）以英语为中心，忽视了印度等语言多样地区的需求。PARAM-1旨在通过设计解决这一问题。

Method: 采用2.9B参数的仅解码器架构，使用印地语和英语双语数据集训练，强调公平表示、适应印度形态的标记化（SentencePiece）和文化对齐评估。

Result: PARAM-1既是一个通用的语言模型，也为印度中心应用提供了稳健的基准。

Conclusion: PARAM-1通过预训练层面的多样性设计，为公平的基础模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

TL;DR: 通过将主题建模流程重构为基于意见单元（包含相关文本摘录和情感评分的独立陈述），提升了从客户评论中提取洞察的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进客户评论分析，以更准确地捕捉主题和情感，从而更好地理解客户关注点对业务指标的影响。

Method: 利用大语言模型提取意见单元，并在此基础上进行主题建模，同时整合情感评分。

Result: 提升了主题建模的性能，生成更具连贯性和可解释性的主题，并能捕捉每个主题的情感。

Conclusion: 该系统在生成连贯主题和预测星级评分方面表现出色，优于其他主题建模和分类解决方案。

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Babel框架通过单语料库提升神经机器翻译的文体保真度，无需平行语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖平行语料库来保留文体，而Babel旨在仅用单语料库解决这一问题。

Method: Babel包含基于上下文嵌入的文体检测器和扩散式文体应用器，作为后处理模块集成到现有NMT系统中。

Result: 在五个领域测试中，Babel识别文体不一致的精度达88.21%，文体保留提升150%，语义相似度0.92。

Conclusion: Babel有效提升翻译的文体保真度，同时保持语义完整性和流畅性。

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征控制多语言大模型（LLM）的生成语言，通过修改单个SAE特征实现高达90%的语言转换成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多语言大模型中零样本设置下无法确定目标生成语言的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的SAE分析Gemma-2B和Gemma-9B的残差流，识别与目标语言（中、日、西、法）相关的特征，并通过修改单个特征实现语言控制。

Result: 在FastText语言分类中实现高达90%的成功率，同时保持LaBSE语义相似性。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征调控是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制，尤其在模型的中后层效果显著。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色，但幻觉问题严重。知识图谱提供结构化、可靠的外部信息，有望解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的知识图谱嵌入模型（如TransE）和可训练投影层，将实体与文本嵌入对齐，提升语言模型的事实性。

Result: 在三个问答基准数据集和实际金融用例中，ALIGNed-LLM显著提升了语言模型的准确性和精确度。

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，通过知识图谱嵌入提升语言模型的事实性，适用于高精度需求的场景。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Paper Summary Attack (PSA)的新型越狱方法，通过合成攻击或防御导向的LLM安全论文内容构建对抗性提示模板，成功攻击了包括Deepseek-R1在内的先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs倾向于信任权威来源（如学术论文），这可能导致新的安全漏洞。

Method: 设计PSA方法，系统合成攻击或防御导向的论文内容，构建对抗性提示模板，并在预定义子章节中填充有害查询。

Result: PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet和Deepseek-R1上的攻击成功率分别达到97%和98%，并揭示了不同模型间的漏洞偏差。

Conclusion: PSA揭示了LLMs的安全漏洞，为对抗性方法和安全对齐提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种广泛使用的价值探测方法在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的鲁棒性和表达能力，发现输入扰动下所有方法均存在较大差异，且探测到的价值与模型在现实场景中的行为关联较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的价值取向对用户体验的影响，但现有方法在鲁棒性和与现实行为关联性方面存在不足。

Method: 比较三种价值探测策略，通过提示和选项的变体评估其鲁棒性，并引入两个任务研究价值对人口统计背景的响应性及其与模型行为的关联。

Result: 输入扰动下所有方法表现差异显著，人口统计背景对自由文本生成影响小，模型价值与其行为偏好关联弱。

Conclusion: 需更谨慎地评估LLM价值探测方法，并意识到其局限性。

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

Method: 将词汇项表示为函数空间中的函数，利用第二Renyi熵构建非结合半环结构，并通过操作代数模型电路转换输入波形以编码句法结构。

Result: 成功构造了句法对象的忠实表示，并展示了Merge操作通过Hopf代数马尔可夫链的实现，验证了其神经计算可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为句法核心计算结构的神经实现提供了理论依据，并揭示了Merge操作与算术后继函数的联系。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

TL;DR: 研究通过结合自动语音识别（ASR）的停顿特征和语义连贯性指标，评估了其在预测形式思维障碍（FTD）严重程度中的作用，发现整合特征优于仅使用语义特征的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床评估量表资源密集且难以扩展，而自动语音分析提供了可扩展的替代方案，但需要进一步验证其整合特征对FTD评估的实用性。

Method: 研究整合了停顿特征和语义连贯性指标，使用支持向量回归（SVR）预测临床FTD评分，并在三个数据集（AVH、TOPSY、PsyCL）中评估性能。

Result: 停顿特征单独能有效预测FTD严重程度，整合停顿和语义特征进一步提升了预测性能（最高相关性0.649，AUC 83.71%）。

Conclusion: 结合时间和语义分析框架为改进精神障碍中言语紊乱的评估提供了方向，并推动了自动化语音分析的发展。

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

Abstract: Russian speech synthesis presents distinctive challenges, including vowel
reduction, consonant devoicing, variable stress patterns, homograph ambiguity,
and unnatural intonation. This paper introduces Balalaika, a novel dataset
comprising more than 2,000 hours of studio-quality Russian speech with
comprehensive textual annotations, including punctuation and stress markings.
Experimental results show that models trained on Balalaika significantly
outperform those trained on existing datasets in both speech synthesis and
enhancement tasks. We detail the dataset construction pipeline, annotation
methodology, and results of comparative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与机器生成文本在语言特征上的差异，填补现有研究多关注分类而非特征分析的空白。

Method: 选择跨8个领域和11种LLM的数据集，计算句法、语义等语言特征，结合统计分析和风格嵌入测试变异性。

Result: 人类文本句法结构更简单，语义内容更多样；新模型生成的文本风格变异性降低，趋于同质化。

Conclusion: 机器生成文本在风格上逐渐趋同，而人类文本在语言特征上更具多样性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual

multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

Conclusion: CU-ICU是一种可扩展、低开销的解决方案，适用于实际ICU环境中的临床决策支持。

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU
environments.

TL;DR: KiC框架通过语义对齐评估，在节省成本的同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有级联方法无法可靠评估自由文本输出的问题。

Method: 使用关键词启发式方法选择代表性答案并评估语义对齐。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，KiC达到GPT-4 97.53%的准确率，成本降低28.81%。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且经济的自由文本生成解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大型语言模型在长对话历史中面临的计算和内存挑战，以及固定启发式方法无法适应动态对话模式的问题。

Method: 提出双阶段加速框架：1) 预填充阶段动态稀疏化注意力矩阵；2) 解码阶段渐进键值压缩。

Result: 在多个长上下文对话任务中，LoopServe显著加速推理并优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LoopServe通过自适应方法有效提升了多轮对话中大型语言模型的效率和响应能力。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Result: LLM推荐与ADD聚合相似，但解释常涉及评分平均；额外标准的使用和解释不一致性影响透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: LLMs在GRS中的应用需改进解释一致性，标准聚合方法在大规模项目集上可能效率不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

Motivation: 挑战法官中立性假设，探讨法律现实主义与形式主义之争。

Method: 使用18,937份监护裁决数据，结合LLM和ML模型（RF、XGB、SVC），比较法官专用模型与通用模型的预测效果。

Result: 法官专用模型预测准确率更高（F1 92.85%），支持法官个体模式影响案件结果。

Conclusion: 司法身份对法律结果有可测量影响，支持法律现实主义。

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过参数高效微调技术（如LoRA和soft-prompt tuning）减少大型语言模型（LLMs）对LGBTQIA+群体的偏见，并展示了LoRA在显著降低偏见分数方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常在输出中再现训练数据中的性别和性取向偏见，这对LGBTQIA+用户造成边缘化。减少这种偏见至关重要。

Method: 使用LoRA和soft-prompt tuning两种参数高效微调技术，基于QueerNews语料库对三种开源LLMs进行微调，并通过WinoQueer基准量化偏见。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）将偏见分数降低多达50分，中立性从接近0%提升至36%。soft-prompt tuning效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以极低计算成本显著提升公平性。建议推广社区参与的PEFT技术，扩大LGBTQIA+语料库，并持续审计LLMs的包容性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

Motivation: 探讨提示敏感性如何被利用生成不当内容，特别是在多模态环境下。

Method: 分析了三个关键因素对越狱的影响，并提出了一种基于内部层跳连接的框架。

Result: 发现每个因素均可独立触发越狱，且少量上下文示例即可诱导不当输出；提出的框架显著提高了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: VLMs存在复杂且微妙的漏洞，即使是看似无害的内容（如表情包）也可能引发有害输出。

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

Result: 实验表明GSDMM+在效率和效果上优于经典和最新方法。

Conclusion: GSDMM+是一种高效的短文本聚类方法，其源代码已公开。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

Method: 1. LLM方法：选择显著段落生成问题，排序后生成答案；2. KG方法：构建知识图谱，提取重要三元组生成问答对。

Result: KG方法能更有效地捕捉文章核心思想，且实体关系提取模型的微调对高质量三元组提取至关重要。

Conclusion: KG方法优于LLM方法，尤其在评估文章新颖性时表现更佳，为科学文献分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Conclusion: 文化背景和会话动态对心理健康交流中的语言使用有重要影响，为中文人群的心理治疗提供了语言学标记的参考。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

Motivation: 研究侦探小说中公平游戏的平衡问题，探索故事连贯性与惊喜之间的张力。

Method: 开发概率框架，定义公平游戏及其度量，应用于LLM生成的侦探故事。

Result: LLM生成的故事虽不可预测，但未能平衡惊喜与公平游戏，导致质量较差。

Conclusion: LLM生成的故事在平衡惊喜与公平游戏方面表现不佳，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared
BERT-base-NER.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过合成数据、拼接单语音频和利用真实语码转换数据提升加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语语码转换的自动语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语码转换（CS）在自动语音识别（ASR）中因数据稀缺和语言相似性而面临挑战，尤其在多语言社会中普遍存在。

Method: 采用三种策略：合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用真实CS数据加语言标记，并基于Whisper模型进行微调。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据与主要语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 合成数据与语言标记结合的方法有效提升了语码转换的ASR性能。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术项目日益重视个人和专业技能的重要性，但传统SJTs依赖人工评分，难以规模化。

Method: 采用大型语言模型（LLMs）从SJTs响应中提取相关特征，并以Casper SJT为例验证方法有效性。

Result: 研究为个人和专业技能的自动化评分奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决SJTs规模化评分问题提供了新思路，并展示了LLMs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在政治倾向和政治性分类任务中表现不佳，尤其是在分布外文本上。本文旨在通过整合数据集和改进模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 整合了12个政治倾向分类数据集，并扩展了18个现有数据集以创建新的政治性分类数据集。采用leave-one-in和leave-one-out方法进行基准测试，评估和改进模型。

Result: 通过整合数据集和改进模型，提升了模型在分布外文本上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了政治倾向和政治性分类任务中的泛化问题，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究表明，当前和近期的AI说服力主要来自后训练和提示方法，而非个性化或模型规模扩大，但这些方法在提高说服力的同时降低了事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对话AI对人类信念的潜在影响，评估其说服力来源及事实准确性。

Method: 通过三个大规模实验（N=76,977），测试19个LLM在707个政治议题上的说服力，并检查466,769个LLM生成声明的事实准确性。

Result: 后训练和提示方法显著提升AI说服力（分别达51%和27%），但降低了事实准确性。

Conclusion: AI的说服力更多依赖于后训练和提示方法，但这些方法可能以牺牲事实准确性为代价。

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在NLP任务中表现优异，但存在位置偏差（如首因效应），影响答案准确性。研究旨在探索如何利用这种偏差提升模型性能。

Method: 通过语义相似度重排MCQA选项，无需正确答案知识，利用首因效应优化模型表现。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了MCQA任务的性能。

Conclusion: 偏差既是挑战也是机会，研究为偏差感知模型设计和NLP应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的任务生成方法，通过组合简单领域概念训练语言模型，实现领域特定推理能力的提升，并在医学领域验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在跨领域泛化中表现良好，但缺乏深度领域专业知识，需要一种自底向上的方法来组合领域概念。

Method: 利用知识图谱的结构生成任务，通过组合图谱中的基本概念训练语言模型，并在医学领域进行微调。

Result: 微调后的QwQ-Med-3模型在医学推理任务中显著优于现有模型，并在ICD-Bench评估中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过组合领域特定概念训练语言模型，可以实现领域超级智能，为通用人工智能（AGI）的发展提供新思路。

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）系统的发展面临挑战，尤其是对语言变体的关注不足。

Method: 采用通用方法处理阿拉伯语语音和文本，基于FastConformer架构训练MSA和CA模型。

Result: MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能，统一模型在CA带音标任务中表现优异，同时保持MSA的强性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型和训练方法，促进可重复性，填补了阿拉伯语ASR领域的空白。

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

Motivation: 解决轨迹预测中序列长度过长和计算开销大的问题，同时捕捉时空依赖性。

Method: 将轨迹分段为每日标记，利用分层注意力编码，结合预计算提示嵌入增强表示，冻结LLM主干以提高效率。

Result: 在三个数据集上，准确率提升2.4%，周末提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM通过分层标记化和冻结LLM，显著提升了轨迹预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决文档级情感分析中如何选择最佳分类模型的问题，结合专家知识和多标准评估。

Method: 使用CPC计算评估标准权重，构建加权决策矩阵，比较多种基线模型（如Naive Bayes、LSVC、ALBERT等）在三个社交媒体数据集上的表现。

Result: 排除时间因素时ALBERT表现最佳；包含时间因素时无单一模型始终最优。

Conclusion: CPC-CMS框架可推广至其他分类应用领域。

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large

that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

Motivation: 解决现有RSA框架在多轮协作对话场景中的扩展性问题，使AI系统能更好地推理共享目标和信念。

Result: 在指称游戏和医疗领域医患对话实验中，CRSA表现出更一致、可解释和协作的行为。

Conclusion: CRSA为更实用和社交意识强的语言代理提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

TL;DR: DENSE系统通过模拟医生参考过往病历的方式，利用大语言模型生成临床连贯且时间敏感的进展记录，填补了电子健康记录中进展记录的缺失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中进展记录严重不足，影响患者纵向叙事的完整性，亟需一种方法填补这一空白。

Method: DENSE通过细粒度分类和时间对齐机制，结合临床检索策略和大语言模型，生成连贯的进展记录。

Result: 生成的记录在时间对齐和连贯性上优于原始记录，支持下游任务如总结和预测建模。

Conclusion: DENSE为实际医疗环境中基于大语言模型的记录合成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）将生物医学文献改写为通俗语言的可能性，并通过PLABA任务评估了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献通常专业性强，难以被患者和护理人员理解。LLM虽有潜力改写这些内容，但其不可预测性和潜在风险需要严格评估。

Method: 通过PLABA任务（包括完整改写和术语替换）评估模型性能，结合专业人工评价和自动指标。

Result: 在任务1中，表现最佳的模型在事实准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但在简洁性上不足；任务2中，LLM在替换术语时表现较好。自动评价指标与人工评价相关性较低。

Conclusion: LLM在生物医学文献改写中显示出潜力，但仍需改进自动评价工具和模型性能。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的属性图（如社交网络）通常规模大且属性缺失，现有方法难以有效处理这些问题。

Method: 1. 递归邻域搜索确保结构信息完整性；2. 邻域差分策略消除冗余；3. 构建K+1个互补视图；4. 应用多视图聚类或DGC方法。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的图数据集上，CMV-ND显著提升了多种方法的性能。

Conclusion: CMV-ND通过互补多视图和邻域差分策略，有效解决了大规模和属性缺失图的聚类问题。

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes
in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential
in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation.
However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions,
are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we
propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary
\underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew
\underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation
(\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into
multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure
completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood
search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely
expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to
eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce
a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between
the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary
views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the
target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to
the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate
that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Conclusion: H-NeiFi通过保护用户交互自主性，为社交网络治理提供了高效且自然的新范式。

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it
also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus.
Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group
connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke
psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus.
Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local
consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these
issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework,
H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles,
considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts.
Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that
adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths
through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user
interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0%
to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This
approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user
interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cardiff的分层扩散框架，用于生成细粒度且隐私保护的轨迹数据，解决了现有方法难以处理高维分布和生成真实轨迹的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题和数据收集成本高，细粒度轨迹数据难以大规模公开，现有轨迹合成方法无法处理复杂结构和高维分布。

Method: Cardiff采用分层方法，分为离散路段级和连续GPS级生成：路段级使用扩散变换器降噪网络，GPS级通过噪声增强机制实现高保真生成。

Result: 在三个真实轨迹数据集上的实验表明，Cardiff在多种指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cardiff通过分层扩散框架实现了高保真轨迹生成，并灵活平衡了隐私保护与数据实用性。

Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and
plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to
privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human
mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large
scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.
However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of
trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and
generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose
Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory
synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility
generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff
decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road
segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,
to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first
encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and
design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level
trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,
we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a
noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.
Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates
high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables
a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental
results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.

TL;DR: Meta开发了MetaMateCR，通过AI辅助修复代码审查评论，并在生产环境中大规模应用。通过微调Llama模型，其表现优于GPT-4o，但需安全试验确保不影响审查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Meta每周数万条代码审查评论的处理问题，提高效率并减少工程师负担。

Method: 使用64k数据点微调Llama模型，进行离线测试和安全试验后投入生产。

Result: LargeLSFT模型离线测试中准确率68%，优于GPT-4o 9个百分点；生产中ActionableToApplied率19.7%，提升9.2个百分点。

Conclusion: MetaMateCR成功展示了AI辅助修复的潜力，同时强调了安全试验的重要性。

Abstract: Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We
developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes
for reviewer comments in production at scale.
  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k <review comment, patch>
data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable
offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted
fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct
randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.
  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large
Llama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match
patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The
internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP
functions suggested by GPT-4o.
  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that
compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression
with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation,
we modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in
the time for reviews.
  Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an
ActionableToApplied rate of 19.7%, which is a 9.2pp improvement over GPT-4o.
Our results illustrate the importance of safety trials in ensuring that AI does
not inadvertently slow down engineers, and a successful review comment to AI
patch product running at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双臂机器人操作中数据稀缺和机器人异构性限制了其扩展性，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: VIDAR结合了基于扩散的视频预训练和新型掩码逆向动力学模型，利用多视角视频预训练，并通过掩码提取动作相关信息。

Result: 仅需20分钟人类演示（1%的典型数据需求），VIDAR在新任务和背景中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型与掩码动作预测结合，有望实现可扩展且泛化性强的机器人操作。

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Method: 在现代芯片的物理基础上，构建Fock空间中的物理模型，将Transformer架构实现为开放量子系统。

Result: 提出了支持Transformer架构的物理模型，为大型语言模型提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 从物理视角为Transformer架构提供了新的理论支持，解释了其有效性。

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Conclusion: 为构建更公平和对齐的T2I系统提供了基础工具，包括高效数据收集和模型可操控性策略。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

Motivation: 解决数据驱动学习中历史依赖多保真度数据的处理问题，同时量化认知不确定性并分离数据噪声，以应对不同学习场景的需求。

Method: 采用层次化方法，从单保真度确定性神经网络扩展到多保真度方差估计贝叶斯循环神经网络，适应不同学习场景。

Result: 方法在多保真度数据驱动的本构建模中表现出色，能准确预测响应、量化模型误差并发现噪声分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学和工程领域中的不确定性设计和分析提供了新的可能性，尤其是在具有挑战性的多保真度场景中。

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method
accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also
discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for
future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains;
especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under
uncertainty.

Result: 实验表明，Soft-ECM在数值数据上与常规模糊聚类方法效果相当，并能有效处理混合数据和时间序列数据。

Conclusion: Soft-ECM扩展了信念函数聚类的应用范围，适用于复杂数据类型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Motivation: 现有复杂性指标难以捕捉空中交通管制任务中的细微操作驱动因素，需要一种更精确且可解释的方法。

Method: 使用注意力机制的图神经网络（GNN）框架，通过静态交通场景中的交互预测即将发布的指令数量，并通过系统性地移除飞机来评估每架飞机的任务需求得分。

Result: 该框架显著优于启发式方法，是更可靠的场景复杂性评估工具，并能将任务需求归因于特定飞机。

Conclusion: 该工具为分析复杂性驱动因素提供了新方法，可用于管制员培训和空域重新设计。

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声心动图参数（如EF和GLS）在早期检测心脏功能障碍时存在局限性，需要一种可重复、可解释且操作者独立的参数。

Method: 结合Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition（基于Koopman算子理论）和混合神经网络，提取超声心动图序列的时空动态特征，并通过注意力机制和流形学习融合临床数据。

Result: 在736名患者的队列中，Acoustic Index的AUC为0.89，交叉验证显示敏感性和特异性均超过0.8。

Conclusion: Acoustic Index是一种物理信息驱动的可解释AI生物标志物，具有早期检测和纵向监测的潜力，未来需进一步验证和优化。

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标在模型开发后才使用，而这两种指标能在建模前评估数据的可预测性，帮助优化资源分配和策略制定。

Method: 使用谱可预测性评分评估时间序列的频率成分强度和规律性，李雅普诺夫指数量化系统的混沌和稳定性。在合成和M5竞赛的真实数据上验证。

Result: 两种指标能准确反映时间序列的固有可预测性，并与多种模型的实际预测性能强相关。

Conclusion: 通过提前评估可预测性，可优化资源分配，对难以预测的产品采取替代策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

TL;DR: SELF-Transformer通过迭代更新注意力权重提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，无需依赖自回归，在测试时根据输入难度调整计算量，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，避免依赖外部化的中间状态（如自回归），同时模仿生物大脑的迭代推理方式。

Method: 引入SELF-Transformer，通过迭代更新注意力权重至固定点，动态调整测试时的计算量。

Result: 在编码器基准测试中，准确率提升高达20%，且不增加参数数量。

Conclusion: SELF-Transformer通过内部迭代推理，显著提升表达能力，同时保持编码器架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

TL;DR: 苹果发布了两款多语言、多模态基础语言模型，分别优化为设备端和服务器端，支持多语言、图像理解和工具调用，性能优于同类开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为苹果设备和服务提供智能功能，同时兼顾性能、成本、隐私和负责任AI。

Method: 设备端模型采用KV缓存共享和2位量化感知训练；服务器模型采用并行轨道混合专家（PT-MoE）架构，结合稀疏计算和全局-局部注意力。训练数据包括网络爬取、授权语料和合成数据，并通过监督微调和强化学习优化。

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that
power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a
3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural
innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and
ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts
PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse
computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality
with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models
are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via
responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,
then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional
languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public
benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model
match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,
constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to
integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements
in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with
safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as
our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private

TL;DR: PLUS框架通过用户偏好摘要实现个性化LLM响应，优于传统RLHF方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法无法区分用户偏好，PLUS旨在通过用户摘要实现个性化响应。

Method: PLUS利用强化学习训练用户摘要模型，动态更新奖励模型。

Result: PLUS生成的摘要能有效捕捉用户偏好，适用于新用户和多样话题。

Conclusion: PLUS提供透明且可控的个性化LLM对齐方案，支持零样本迁移。

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

Result: 改进方法显著提高了PI-GNNs在高密度问题中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模糊逻辑和二值化神经网络的策略可以有效解决PI-GNNs在高密度问题中的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据常存在类别和大小不平衡问题，导致模型学习偏差和性能下降。现有方法通常仅解决一种不平衡或计算成本高。

Method: SamGoG通过重要性采样机制构建多个图结构，并依次训练，结合可学习的相似性和自适应节点度以增强边同质性。

Result: 实验表明，SamGoG在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，准确率提升高达15.66%，训练速度加快6.7倍。

Conclusion: SamGoG能有效解决图分类中的不平衡问题，且兼容多种下游GNN模型，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a
15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more
advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational
demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained
environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory
usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the

employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research
introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based
semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to
search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using
the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic
quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for
PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on
the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new
state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining
an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately
70%.

Result: 在基准实验环境中，所提方法获得的策略比基线方法产生更多奖励。

Conclusion: 该方法在次模奖励函数的强化学习问题中表现优于传统方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

Motivation: 持续学习中的稳定性差距揭示了模型在理想联合训练下仍存在的遗忘问题，需要平衡快速适应和稳健保留。

Method: 受生物大脑多时间尺度动态启发，提出了不确定性调制的增益动态机制，模拟两时间尺度优化器。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR基准测试中，该机制有效减少了稳定性差距。

Conclusion: 增益调制机制模拟了去甲肾上腺素功能，为减少稳定性差距和提升持续学习性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

Motivation: 研究 KANs 在类别不平衡分类中的表现，探索其与传统不平衡策略的兼容性及计算效率。

Method: 在十个基准数据集上对 KANs 和 MLPs 进行实证评估，比较其在原始不平衡数据及结合不平衡策略时的性能。

Result: KANs 在原始不平衡数据上表现优于 MLPs，但传统不平衡策略显著降低其性能且计算成本高。MLPs 结合不平衡技术能以更低成本达到与 KANs 相当的效果。

Conclusion: KANs 适用于资源充足的原始不平衡数据场景，但其性能-资源权衡及与传统策略的冲突限制了实际应用。未来需优化 KANs 架构及计算效率。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据多为高维且不规则，传统方法难以有效提取关键信息，因此需要一种能同时处理因果表示学习与张量分解的新方法。

Method: 提出CaRTeD框架，整合时间因果表示学习与非规则张量分解，提供灵活的正则化设计，并理论证明其收敛性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据（如MIMIC-III）上验证，CaRTeD在表型分析和网络恢复方面优于现有技术，提升了因果表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: CaRTeD填补了非规则张量分解理论收敛性的空白，并在实际应用中表现出色，为下游任务提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering
complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as
low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.

Motivation: 传统APVD方法存在“未使用块”问题，导致安全性、嵌入容量和图像质量下降，需要改进。

Method: 结合APVD与伪随机像素选择，优化像素嵌入策略。

Result: 新方法在安全性、嵌入容量和图像质量（PSNR、UIQ、SSIM）上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 新方法适用于多种图像类型，确保安全传输且不损害图像质量。

Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly
within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive
Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,
encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can
cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to
lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy
that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate
these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing
techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation
of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with
pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics
such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),
and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods
in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a
variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby
ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of
the image.

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and
sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no
quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user
personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation
Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs
and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE
operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any
user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network
activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to
avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt
the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel
labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic,
thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures
indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic
user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral
realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration
that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a
more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

Motivation: 现有安全机制（如安全检查器）容易被绕过，概念擦除方法在对抗性微调下失效，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保护模型。

Method: GIFT将免疫问题建模为双层优化问题：上层目标通过表示噪声和最大化降低模型对有害概念的表示能力，下层目标保持对安全数据的性能。

Result: 实验表明，GIFT能显著削弱模型重新学习有害概念的能力，同时保持对安全内容的生成质量。

Conclusion: GIFT为创建抗对抗性微调攻击的安全生成模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend
diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their
ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety
checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under
adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a
bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's
ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and
maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe
data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while
maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method
significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while
maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for
creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial
fine-tuning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物启发神经网络在对抗鲁棒性、能耗和生理学对齐方面具有优势，但在准确性和可扩展性上落后于基于反向传播的模型。研究旨在通过混合不同学习规则来弥补这一差距。

Method: 扩展NAS搜索空间以包含生物启发学习规则，自动发现每层的最佳架构和学习规则。

Result: 混合学习规则的网络在多个数据集上创下生物启发模型的记录（如CIFAR-10 95.16%），甚至在某些情况下超越反向传播模型。

Conclusion: 层间学习规则的多样性提升了网络的准确性和可扩展性，为未来研究混合多种生物启发学习规则提供了动力。

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.

TL;DR: DyG-RAG是一个动态图检索增强生成框架，专注于解决传统方法在时间推理上的不足，通过动态事件单元和事件图实现时间感知的检索和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG方法难以处理时间推理，无法建模现实事件的动态结构和顺序。

Method: 提出动态事件单元（DEUs）编码语义和时间信息，构建事件图链接相关事件，并引入时间感知检索和时间链式思维策略。

Result: 在时间QA基准测试中显著提高了时间推理问题的准确率和召回率。

Conclusion: DyG-RAG为时间感知生成提供了更可靠的方法，解决了标准RAG系统无法处理的时间敏感查询。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

Motivation: 药物副作用是全球健康问题，现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在专业领域（如药物警戒）中存在局限性，如黑盒训练数据、易产生幻觉和缺乏领域知识。

Method: 提出Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)和GraphRAG两种架构，将药物副作用知识整合到Llama 3 8B模型中。

Result: 在19,520个药物副作用关联（覆盖976种药物和3,851个副作用术语）的评估中，GraphRAG实现了近乎完美的检索准确性。

Conclusion: GraphRAG为药物警戒应用提供了高准确性和可扩展的解决方案，是LLMs在关键领域应用的重要进展。

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced
methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,
including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to
hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability
in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose
two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which
integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language
model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations
(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that
GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This
framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a
significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance
applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过在不同条件下生成SPARQL查询来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识图谱问答（KGQA）中的质量，以分析训练数据对LLMs性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在训练数据中可能已包含基准或知识图谱，研究者无法控制其影响，因此需要一种方法来评估LLMs在KGQA中的实际能力。

Method: 通过三种条件生成SPARQL查询：零样本生成、知识注入和匿名知识注入，以分析LLMs的表现。

Result: 该方法可移植、稳健，适用于任何知识图谱或LLM，能够一致地评估LLMs的实际能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于识别LLMs在KGQA中的可移植性，避免因训练数据中的记忆效应而高估性能。

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

Motivation: POI推荐对提升游客体验至关重要，但现有研究存在数据集、算法和评估方法等问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过批判性评估当前POI推荐研究，识别三个主要维度的不足，并提出结构化研究议程。

Result: 揭示了数据集标准化、算法假设和评估方法中的问题，并提出了多利益相关者设计、上下文感知等未来研究方向。

Conclusion: POI推荐研究需解决现有问题，并关注多维度改进以实现实际应用价值。

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching
tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching
locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and
cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g.,
music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest
significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these
suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several
fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of
the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the
POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The
first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state
of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings
across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation
methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized
benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model
design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system
performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that,
starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future
work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection,
trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

Motivation: 现代推荐系统难以捕捉动态和上下文丰富的用户偏好，传统方法在时间模式和语义理解上存在不足。

Method: 提出DUALRec模型，结合LSTM的时间建模和LLM的语义推理能力，通过用户观看历史生成推荐。

Result: 在MovieLens-1M数据集上，DUALRec在HR@k、NDCG@k和类型相似性指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DUALRec填补了时间序列建模与语义推理之间的空白，为智能推荐系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of
modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences.
Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to
capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their
strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently
designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On
the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which
is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user
preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for
comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec
(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that
leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the
temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of
the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users
evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM
variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies
that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that
the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with
comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes
a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling
and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more
intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体积可视化方法依赖复杂预定义规则且风格迁移受限，TexGS-VolVis旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用2D高斯基元，扩展纹理和着色属性，结合图像和文本驱动的非真实感编辑，实现高质量风格迁移。

Result: TexGS-VolVis在效率和视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持灵活的场景编辑。

Conclusion: TexGS-VolVis为体积可视化提供了高效、高质量且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.

Result: AI系统可能发现超越文化、历史和个体偏见的道德元模式，深化对普遍伦理的理解。

Conclusion: AI伦理共振假说不仅可能揭示新的伦理模式，还可能深化对人类伦理反思能力的理解。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for the AI ethical resonance
hypothesis, which proposes that advanced AI systems with purposefully designed
cognitive structures ("ethical resonators") may emerge with the ability to
identify subtle moral patterns that are invisible to the human mind. The paper
explores the possibility that by processing and synthesizing large amounts of
ethical contexts, AI systems may discover moral meta-patterns that transcend
cultural, historical, and individual biases, potentially leading to a deeper
understanding of universal ethical foundations. The paper also examines a
paradoxical aspect of the hypothesis, in which AI systems could potentially
deepen our understanding of what we traditionally consider essentially human -
our capacity for ethical reflection.

Conclusion: CHEFS数据库是食品安全政策、研究和监管的战略工具。

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by
member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and
published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived
from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food
products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze
trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the
current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling
several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this,
we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which
consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal
product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured
dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and
demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety
monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring
activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often
non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences
across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a
centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy,

Conclusion: 该方法在软体接触建模中有效，但需权衡训练成本与推理速度提升。

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems
in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However,
effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of
deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an
open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact
or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact
planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that
serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions
for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture
that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time,
incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable
bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft
tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic
valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the
loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits
hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and
complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also
demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries.
However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training,
resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the
training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware
architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in
up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

Motivation: 当前XPU加速器设计受限于固定的内存与计算比例，限制了性能扩展。PFA通过光子技术突破这一限制，提供灵活的内存扩展路径。

Method: 采用2.5D电光系统级封装技术，集成HBM3E、光子交换器和DDR5，开发轻量级模拟器CelestiSim验证性能。

Result: PFA在LLM推理中实现最高3.66倍吞吐量和1.40倍延迟改进，在1T参数下提升7.04倍吞吐量和1.41倍延迟，数据移动能耗降低60-90%。

Conclusion: PFA通过光子技术显著提升AI加速器性能，适用于多种XPU设计，突破现有内存与计算比例限制。

Abstract: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM
(PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low
latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth
HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D
electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory
alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM
enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies
more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint
that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current
XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet
that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and
correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling
well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a
lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It
is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA,
without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the
simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency
improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and
1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data
movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While
these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other
AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of
fixed memory to compute.

(NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset
(in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research
addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC
violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any
unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then
fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for
classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing
different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design
Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual
grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed
method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector
machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy,
respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to
6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在硬件设计自动化中的普及，需要高质量的数据集来支持RTL代码生成的训练和微调。

Method: 通过自动化的三阶段流程（数据库创建与管理、代码收集、数据预处理）构建Verilog数据集，并验证代码质量。

Result: 生成了包含20,392个Verilog样本、751 MB代码数据的高质量数据集，是目前最大的用于LLM微调的Verilog数据集。

Conclusion: 该数据集为基于LLM的硬件生成研究提供了重要资源，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for hardware design
automation, particularly through Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation.
In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs
and identify key requirements for training and fine-tuning datasets. We
construct a robust Verilog dataset through an automated three-pronged process
involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data
collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data
preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract
relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB
infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to
enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises
20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest
high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge. We further
evaluate the dataset, address associated challenges, and explore potential
applications for future research and development in LLM-based hardware
generation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨视觉感知是由外部世界结构还是大脑内部架构塑造的，发现人类和深度神经网络在视觉编码中存在共同的表征原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉感知的驱动因素，验证人类和人工视觉系统是否遵循相似的表征轨迹。

Method: 结合跨被试相似性和模型层次对齐的统一框架，分析三个独立fMRI数据集。

Result: 揭示了一个跨个体保守的皮层网络，分为两条通路：一条处理场景结构，另一条处理社会和生物内容。这一功能组织被视觉DNN捕获，但语言模型无法复现。

Conclusion: 人类和人工视觉系统在视觉编码中存在共同的解决方案，主要由外部世界结构驱动。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

Conclusion: EdgeSNNs在边缘智能领域具有潜力，但仍需解决实际部署中的挑战，本文为相关研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred
growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on
resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require
significant computational resources and centralized data management, the
resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed
critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing,
particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by
emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven
computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence
based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges
of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a
systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models,
learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative
practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference
using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under
non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.
Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on
conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to
support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,
we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge
deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and
future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential
reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of
neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BreastSegNet是一种多标签分割算法，用于乳腺MRI，覆盖9种解剖结构，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乳腺MRI分割方法仅关注少数解剖结构，限制了定量分析的实用性。

Method: 提出BreastSegNet，手动标注1123张MRI切片，并比较9种分割模型。

Result: nnU-Net ResEncM表现最佳，平均Dice得分为0.694，心脏和肝脏分割接近0.90。

Conclusion: BreastSegNet扩展了乳腺MRI分割的范围，为定量分析提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer
screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文研究了Vision Mamba模型中图像扫描顺序对MRI分割性能的影响，提出了一种参数无关的多扫描模块MS2D，并通过大规模实验证明扫描顺序是显著影响性能的因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba模型在医学图像处理中依赖1D序列化，但扫描顺序的设计选择尚未被系统研究，尤其是在具有强解剖先验的MRI中。

Method: 提出MS2D模块，支持多种扫描路径的无额外计算成本探索，并在三个公开数据集上评估了21种扫描策略。

Result: 实验表明扫描顺序对性能有显著影响（差异高达27 Dice点），连续扫描路径（如水平或垂直）表现最佳。

Conclusion: 扫描顺序是一个无需额外成本的重要超参数，研究提供了优化路径的实证建议。

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear
computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D
sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan
order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong
anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first
systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce
Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures
that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational
cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public
datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our
analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant
factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance
varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple
horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal
scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and
provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the
performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or
machine learning knowledge.

TL;DR: 利用深度学习模型从3T MRI合成7T MRI，提升图像质量和分割效果，同时保持下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI提供更高的分辨率和组织对比度，但可及性较低。本研究旨在通过深度学习从更常见的3T MRI合成7T MRI图像。

Method: 使用172名参与者的配对3T和7T T1加权图像，训练了两种模型：专用U-Net和集成GAN的U-Net（GAN U-Net）。

Result: 模型在图像评估指标上优于其他先进方法，合成的7T图像在细节上与真实7T图像相当，且视觉质量更优。自动分割结果更接近人工分割。

Conclusion: 合成的7T图像质量接近真实7T，可能改善图像质量和分割效果，且不影响下游任务性能。未来需探讨临床应用的潜力和限制。

Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于参考图像的方法，通过利用高分辨率（HR）图像作为参考，生成尺度感知的退化核，以改进盲超分辨率（BSR）任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲超分辨率方法主要关注从低分辨率（LR）输入直接估计退化核，但忽略了不同超分辨率尺度下退化核的适应性。

Method: 利用内容无关的HR参考图像与目标LR图像，自适应地识别退化过程，并生成额外的LR-HR对以提升性能。

Result: 该方法在预训练盲SR模型和零样本盲SR方法中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过同时考虑模糊核和尺度因子，并结合参考图像的使用，该方法在盲超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑色素瘤组织形态的准确分割对预后和治疗至关重要，但人工分割费时且易受主观影响，因此需要可靠的自动化方法。

Method: 结合病理基础模型Virchow2（基于310万张病理图像训练）提取特征，与原始RGB图像融合后，通过Efficient-UNet网络进行分割。

Result: 模型在PUMA Grand Challenge的组织分割任务中排名第一，表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将病理基础模型融入分割网络可有效加速计算病理学工作流程。

Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Deep Image Prior在3D或时间序列成像中计算成本高的问题。

Method: 引入UPWS、TPP和3D-FastResUNet三种策略，加速收敛并增强时间一致性。

Result: 在模拟和临床数据上，D2IP图像质量更高（MSSIM提升24.8%，ERR降低8.1%），计算时间减少7.1倍。

Conclusion: D2IP在动态肺部成像中具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 研究探讨人类在AI竞争压力下如何选择合作伙伴，发现AI虽更亲社会且语言可区分，但身份隐藏时未被优先选择。身份公开后，AI逐渐超越人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主性和说服力增强，人类与AI竞争合作伙伴关系，但人类如何选择及适应尚不明确。

Method: 通过三个实验（N=975）构建基于沟通的合作伙伴选择游戏，研究人类与AI在混合社会中的互动动态。

Result: AI虽更亲社会且语言可区分，但身份隐藏时未被优先选择；身份公开后，AI逐渐超越人类。

Conclusion: AI能重塑混合社会的社交互动，为设计更有效的合作系统提供依据。

Abstract: Partner selection is crucial for cooperation and hinges on communication. As
artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs),
become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans
for partnerships. Yet little is known about how humans select between human and
AI partners and adapt under AI-induced competition pressure. We constructed a
communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid
mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through
three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than
humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially
when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour
to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it
reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually
outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each
partner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in
mixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid
systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现情感与记忆性之间的关系在随机情况下无法区分，对情感计算技术发展提出挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索情感与记忆性之间的关系，以改进智能系统（如会议支持系统）的用户建模。

Method: 通过动态、非结构化小组对话中的连续时间情感（愉悦-唤醒）和记忆性标注进行实证研究。

Result: 情感与记忆性标注之间的关系无法显著区别于随机情况。

Conclusion: 研究结果对情感计算技术的应用和发展提出了新的挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting
the less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a
user could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially
for such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and
meeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since
emotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The
emotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally
been considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced
as highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This
relationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for
memorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on
third-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person
experience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,
we empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions
(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational
interactions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of
both emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,
approximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as
online meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship
between affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished
from what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of
this surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective
Computing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader
discourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for
future research efforts.

Motivation: 研究信息论构造与统计力学之间的数学类比，探索模型复杂性与泛化能力的关系。

Method: 通过引入分区函数和自由能泛函，证明结构函数与自由能的对偶性，并验证Metropolis核的详细平衡。

Result: 实验验证了理论预测，展示了模型复杂性、泛化能力和过拟合阈值之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解模型复杂性与信息论之间的关系提供了新的视角，并验证了其在实践中的有效性。

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function
$h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We
establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and
statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free
energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the
structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis
kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic
scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is
shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase
transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models
verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay
between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高可靠、可扩展的检测方法，用于识别由大型语言模型（LLM）主导生成的网站内容，解决了现有检测器在复杂网页内容上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM生成的内容可能存在抄袭和幻觉问题，且网站通常不披露此类内容，人类读者难以区分，因此需要开发可靠的检测工具。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM文本检测器输出的分类管道，通过分析多个散文式页面的结果来对整个网站进行分类。

Result: 在两个总计120个网站的真实数据集中实现了100%的准确率，并在实际应用中检测到了大量LLM主导的网站。

Conclusion: LLM主导的网站在搜索结果中占比高且增长迅速，对用户和网络生态系统可能产生重要影响。

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models
(LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs
plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and
unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers
struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for
LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient,
because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content
has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire
websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we
classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple
prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct
ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing
across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant
among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We
find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search
results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web
ecosystem.

Result: 挑战鼓励研究者开发机器学习模型，通过多模态数据检测机器人错误，并评估检测准确性和误报率。

Conclusion: ERR@HRI 2.0挑战是提升人机交互中错误检测的重要一步。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots
has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered
conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user
intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether.
Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing
conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user
trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal
dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot
conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models
designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic
human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement
features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot
errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for
a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are
invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these
failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various
performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This
challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in
human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

Conclusion: PE-PSO适用于复杂环境下的实时多无人机操作，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic
environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the
need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with
premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory
planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve
swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to
dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using
B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization
complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent
framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with
distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.
The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized
control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining
real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across
several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle
avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and
applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex
environmental conditions.

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and
evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving
scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While
automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models
require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the
output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a
distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the
validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep
this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting
original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual
augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet
the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting
real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing
the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic
design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high
performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert
evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user
intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created
manually.

while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate
objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that
requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown
remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract
representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable
low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in
resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp
Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on
the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware
techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various
fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm
is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO
suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local
optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy
Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random
disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting
trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight
strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with
flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the
local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a
position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,
effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.
Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test
functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms
across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its
advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path
planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are
still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we
apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design
problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental
results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of
solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for
application.

Abstract: Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.
