Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown\npromise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated\nand scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is\ndifficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and\nproposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the\nautomated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective\nphysicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is\nfine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient\nconversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including\nProfessionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual\nDistraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from\nthe LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on\nmultidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The\nresults show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\\% accuracy, with\nmajor criteria items over 90\\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a\nsolution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment.

This approach\nyields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we\ncan drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing\nmodel size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of\ninterest, a potentially useful inductive bias.

However, expressive and\nrealistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between\nmotion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a\npost-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly\noptimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of\nthe denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily\ncontrol motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be\neffectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.\nBuilding on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference\noptimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment\nmodules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep\ninterval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and\nactivated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion\nnaturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman\nimproves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a\n3.3$\\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on\ngeneration quality.

In\ncontrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on\nartificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from\nreal middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,\nhistory, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended\nquestions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual\ninterpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual\ncues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple\ndimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial\ncrafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve\nless than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,\nmathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate\nsignificant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world\nmultimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a\nmeaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in\nnon-English contexts.

Building on\ntechniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,\nwe demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by\nboreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural\nnetwork. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological\nfeatures, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability\nof data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of\nsubsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that\nmimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic\nintrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of\nsamples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic\ndata is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen\nmap of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with\nincreasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,\nfaults, folds, dikes, and sills.

To\noperationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including\novercorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and\nover-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,\nChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7\npercent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of\n0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6\npercent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive\nresource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection\nrisk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),\nsuggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our\nfindings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how\nthey arrive at those decisions", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6e38\u620f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u5982\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4fee\u8ba2\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6218\u7565\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4fee\u6b63\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u98ce\u9669\u7387\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572812\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c4320\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "ChatGPT-o3-mini\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u80dc\u738774.7%\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u6210\u529f\u738778.6%\uff1b\u800cQwen-Plus\u56e0\u8d44\u6e90\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u98ce\u9669\u7387\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing UDA studies are based on natural\nimages or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse\nconditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a\nunique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which\nstatistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically\nadjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias.

In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is\nrequired. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it\ncan formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half\nof a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an\naverage cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly\nmore cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through\nparallel execution.

This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks\nthat bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more\ncomprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these\ntasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded\nsystem programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench\nconsists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware\nplatforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover\nseveral key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic\ninformation, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In\nthe cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance\nwith MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%\npass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%\npass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like\nDeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this\ndomain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge\nduring pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:\nretrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM\nperformance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with\nDeepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.\nAdditionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from\n21.4% to 27.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmbedAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Embedbench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u8868\u73b0\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u672a\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEmbedAgent\u8303\u5f0f\u548cEmbedbench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b126\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8986\u76d69\u79cd\u7535\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c3\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd510\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982DeepSeek-R1\u5728\u751f\u6210\u539f\u7406\u56fe\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a50%\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering\nmethods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a\nself-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral\nclustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally\nincorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,\nand their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the\nentire clustering process.\n  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on\nbasis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for\nefficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity\nwithin subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns\nclustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local\nstructure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme\nthat refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar\npixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are\njointly optimized to reinforce each other.\n  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the\nstructural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time\nand space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale\nHSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art techniques.

However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability\nof textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing\ntext-image plans remains understudied.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans\nstep-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step\nbased on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the\nnext one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft\nwith the extracted visual information.

Recently, for the\ngrowing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,\npersonalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to\nleverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual\nuser preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,\nmost PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the\ndata and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,\nwe first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for\nmulti-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution\nshifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all\nclients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we\npropose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides\ncustomized global models to each client.

Supervised detection relies on large,\ncurated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for\nzero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit\nsome task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we\nshow that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and\nsignificantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing\nthe model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the\nsynthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1\nscores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are\nconsistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,\nand animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating\nstrong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional\nmodel sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --\nsuggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a\nbehavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers\nfrom diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.\nEven here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --\nindicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that\ntask-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent\ncapabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a\nsimple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the\nmulti-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual\nrepresentation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal\nperspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic\nambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.\nCode and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aManager\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u5854\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BridgeTower\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6316\u6398\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faManagerTower\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u5854VLM\u7684\u6bcf\u5c42\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5c42\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165Manager\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230MLLM\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982LLaVA-OV\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "ManagerTower\u57284\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38VL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1bLLaVA-OV-Manager\u572820\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u591a\u7f51\u683c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Manager\u63d2\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u7f51\u683c\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic\nspectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,\ntraditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically\ndeveloped to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and\namplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art.

State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on\npredicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is\nconstructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is\nlabor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also\ndirectly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce\nBootstrapping Your Behavior (\\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that\npredicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all\nbehaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual\nbehavior vocabulary selection.

However, the substantial\nKey-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant\ndeployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical\ninformation needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due\nto high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple\nyet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based\non the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence\ndimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks\nand propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition\nstrategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity.

First, by incorporating text\nsemantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce\nposture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,\nbased on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a\ncross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse\nsign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the\ndiversity of modal features.

Previously, we introduced an ASR\npostprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction\n(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and\ntechnical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC\nachieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low\nwhen dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different\nspellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal\nfusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis\nof ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words\nand homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection\nmodule suffers from overdetection.

However, most existing methods\nadopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static\nmodel capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets\nfor dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two\nchallenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require\nvarying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different\ntasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts\n(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with\ncontrolled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining\npreviously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise\nexpert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to\nresolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to\nfacilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based\ninter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module\nin MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate\nthe modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average\nimprovement over the best baseline.

Our code is available at https://github.com/violet-42/CM-CGNS", "summary": "Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and\nreports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and\nefficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing\nmodels suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of\nnegative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion\nof false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking\nthe fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition\ntasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but\nignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.\nMotivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal\nCluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image\nReconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features\nobtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.\nThis module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information\ninteraction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for\ndownstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed\nCM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable\nfor various recognition tasks.

Due to their reliance on idealized\nassumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to\ndynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships\nbetween modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named\nDynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key\nideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to\nsuppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with\nadaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through\nattention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and\nPrototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via\ncovariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic\nconsistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it\npresents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization\nunder imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and\nto balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting\nlosses and scaling gradients.

Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user\nbehavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and\nperform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well\nrequires training data that captures the diversity across users and\nenvironments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual\ndata generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging\nLarge Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which\nare then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions\nare executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we\nextended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents\nactivities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,\nvirtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.\nAcross five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor\ndata substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are\nlimited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a\nfew days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the\nentire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of\nvirtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,\nwhich is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring\nany manual data collection efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentSense\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bb0\u5f55\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45HAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb6\u5ead\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7AgentSense\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u7269\u53ca\u5176\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7684VirtualHome\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5f55\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aHAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u3002\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u865a\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3HAR\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002"}}

This paper challenges the assumption of\nmonolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a\nnovel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically\nadjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT\nleverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system\nprompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired\nattributes like writing style.

This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory\nand bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant\nadvantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,\nhardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs\n(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and\nmatrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and\nscientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a\nfundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on\nSIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves\ntoward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized\ninference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,\nour paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies\nfor adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,\nincluding x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V.

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase.

Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

For\neach problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator\nwith access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,\nafter which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse\nrange of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific\nreasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language\nmodels including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,\neven under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show\nresistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To\nmitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like\nprogressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously\nattempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help\nmodels achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of\npotential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model\noverconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in\nLLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in\nself-improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u6027\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u53cd\u9988\u6469\u64e6\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u5b58\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u6027\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u4f46\u672a\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u6469\u64e6\u662fLLMs\u7684\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This practical challenge\nsignificantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,\nwe propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing\nPKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,\nCoda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a\ncompact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be\nidentified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a\ncluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak\nsignals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning\nthat the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing\nPKT solutions.

To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel\nreasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained\nvisual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the\nquestion or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects\nrelevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise\nanswers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a\nlarge-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed\nvision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows\nthe model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is\nintroduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,\nenhancing multimodel comprehension.

Stage 2: the upsampled\nprediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an\nunconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing\nhigh-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI\ndatasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net\nbaselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while\ndelivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results\ndemonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to\na diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits\nconventional phase-retrieval networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDiffPR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86QPI\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4QPI\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u9891\u8bca\u65ad\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffPR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0U-Net\uff08\u53d6\u6d88\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u9891\u76f8\u4f4d\u56fe\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aQPI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDiffPR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eU-Net\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u53471.1 dB\uff0cMAE\u964d\u4f4e11%\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d6\u6d88\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u6062\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform\nmachines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires\nhigh-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for\nhigh levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.\nUncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement\nnoise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although\nadvanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are\nutilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic\nerrors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a\ncomparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated\nmanufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that\nsimulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications\ncan reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great\nextent.

Because efficiency has been the main metric of\nprogress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible\ncatastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to\nsearch for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small\namount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream\ntask classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token\nfor decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from\nincorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to\ncontrol a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In\nSSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected\nby the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be\ncontrolled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models\nfrom three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and\nfour diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias\nin Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a\nsingle token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,\nfor light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA\nrank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable\nto small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence\nimproving robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\uff08SSTI\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u88ab\u64cd\u63a7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u5373\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e14LoRA\u79e9\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5PEFT\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\u5373\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\uff1bLoRA\u79e9\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9ad8\u79e9LoRA\u5728\u5f3aSSTI\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8b66\u60d5\u865a\u5047\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u79e9LoRA\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing\nresearch focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model\noutput quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For\nexample, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG\nsystem might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,\ncausing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even\nwhen the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this\npaper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which\nsystematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases\nthrough a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation\nmethod based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection\ntechniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback\nmechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream\nlarge language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance\nmodel biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense\nmechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals\nthat poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and\nclarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness.

While most\nstudies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper\nhighlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic\ndecision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness\nrequirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general\nframework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average\nexpected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could\nobtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three\ncomponents that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the\nspurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain.

Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and\ndata-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader\napplicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,\nhave the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of\ngeneralizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could\nfundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To\nunderstand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:\n(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with\ncovariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning\nfor classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying\noperational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited}\ngeneralizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on\nunseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion\nof covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their\nperformance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.\nWhile TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream\nclassification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in\nforecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs\nforecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle\nin more complex building environments compared to statistical models.

However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking\ndeeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which\nconsequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods\nbased on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while\neffectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.\nBased on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding\n(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding\nan SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to\ncombine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our\nmodel operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration\nconsists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse\nAttention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on\nfeatures, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims\nto achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based\nFeature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information\nby combining features from different steps.

Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using\nDice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a\nmean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,\nsignificantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;\nBET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05).

In\nenterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that\ncan be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to\ncreate datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL\n(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create\nNL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation\npipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally\nequivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest\nNL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be\nserved as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries\nfrom BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this\ncollection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models\nstruggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent\ndetection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find\nthat models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending\non the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are\nemployed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best\ntask completion rates are far below what may be required for effective\ngeneral-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement\nin current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed\nablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available\nas well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation.

However, the cochlea Dice score declined\nin 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations\naffecting overall segmentation performance.

Compared to conventional\nindependent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search\nenables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy\nprocess rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM\nRL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly\nincorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes\nintermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model\ntraining.

Existing signals do not take into account the training\ndynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during\ntraining, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,\ninfluence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in\nmisleading influence attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u8c03\u8bd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u5982TraceIn\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8868\u683c\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7b49\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u53f7\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u56e0\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u62b5\u6d88\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u62b5\u6d88\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our approach addresses\nthese challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured\ncausal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges\nsemantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to\naccurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a\nthree-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are\nmeticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,\neffect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these\ngraphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid\nCypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and\nstructural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage\nutilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with\nXML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal\nrelationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal\nachieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20\nfew-shot examples.

The advantages of robust\ntraining such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in\ncompact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact\ntransformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.\nThe new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the\nrobustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box\nscenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent\nattacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and\ninvestigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different\narchitectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer\nfrom the transferability of adversarial examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u578bTransformer\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u653b\u51fb\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u578bTransformer\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u4ece\u5927\u578bTransformer\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4Transformer\u514d\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}
