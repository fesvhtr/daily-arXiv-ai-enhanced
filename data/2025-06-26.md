### [1] [Computer Vision based Automated Quantification of Agricultural Sprayers Boom Displacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19939)
*Aryan Singh Dalal,Sidharth Rai,Rahul Singh,Treman Singh Kaloya,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于计算机视觉的系统，用于量化农业喷雾器喷杆的运动，以提高喷雾精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喷雾器喷杆的不稳定性是喷雾应用误差的主要因素之一，但目前缺乏定量数据来改进喷杆设计和控制系统。

Method: 使用YOLO V7、V8和V11神经网络模型实时跟踪喷杆边缘目标，并结合倾角传感器验证模型输出。

Result: 模型检测目标的准确率超过90%，距离估计与传感器数据误差在0.026米内。

Conclusion: 该系统可量化喷杆运动，为喷杆稳定性改进和喷雾精度提升提供数据支持。

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

### [2] [EBC-ZIP: Improving Blockwise Crowd Counting with Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19955)
*Yiming Ma,Victor Sanchez,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EBC-ZIP框架，通过零膨胀泊松回归改进人群计数中的密度图估计，解决了现有方法对稀疏区域的忽视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视地面真实密度图的极端稀疏性，导致模型在稀疏区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出EBC-ZIP框架，使用零膨胀泊松回归替代传统回归损失，结合EBC框架的优势。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，EBC-ZIP表现优于EBC，并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EBC-ZIP通过更合理的概率损失函数，显著提升了人群计数的性能。

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

### [3] [ToSA: Token Merging with Spatial Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20066)
*Hsiang-Wei Huang,Wenhao Chai,Kuang-Ming Chen,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToSA是一种结合语义和空间信息的新型令牌合并方法，通过深度图像生成伪空间令牌，优化视觉Transformer的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有令牌合并方法主要依赖视觉令牌的特征相似性，忽略了空间信息在早期层中的潜在作用。

Method: 提出ToSA方法，利用深度图像生成伪空间令牌，结合语义和空间信息指导令牌合并。

Result: 在多个视觉和具身问答基准测试中优于现有方法，同时显著减少ViT运行时间。

Conclusion: ToSA是一种高效的ViT加速解决方案，能更好地保留关键场景结构。

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves
critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA
outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual
and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,
making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration. The code will be

### [4] [BrokenVideos: A Benchmark Dataset for Fine-Grained Artifact Localization in AI-Generated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20103)
*Jiahao Lin,Weixuan Peng,Bojia Zi,Yifeng Gao,Xianbiao Qi,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BrokenVideos数据集，用于定位AI生成视频中的视觉伪影，提升检测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频的视觉伪影（如运动不一致、物体变形等）影响真实性和用户信任，但缺乏专门用于伪影定位的基准数据集。

Method: 构建BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，标注像素级伪影区域，并通过人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 实验表明，基于BrokenVideos训练的模型能显著提升伪影定位能力。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos为生成视频模型的伪影定位研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

### [5] [From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了从2D感知到3D认知的世界模型发展，重点分析了3D表示和世界知识的驱动作用，并探讨了3D世界建模的核心能力与应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对3D认知世界模型技术的系统分析，本文旨在填补这一空白，提供一个结构化的综述框架。

Method: 通过引入概念框架，分类新兴技术，并分析3D表示和世界知识的作用，探讨3D世界建模的核心能力。

Result: 总结了3D物理场景生成、3D空间推理和3D空间交互等核心能力，并讨论了在具体应用中的部署。

Conclusion: 指出了数据、建模和部署中的挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，以推动更稳健和通用的3D世界模型发展。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

### [6] [EAR: Erasing Concepts from Unified Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20151)
*Haipeng Fan,Shiyuan Zhang,Baohunesitu,Zihang Guo,Huaiwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EAR的微调方法，用于在自回归模型中有效且保持效用的概念擦除，并引入了WGA和TLM策略以及ECGVF基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉理解和图像生成任务中表现优异，但如何在保持生成质量的同时去除不需要的概念仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出EAR方法，结合WGA策略和TLM策略，并开发ECGVF基准用于评估。

Result: 实验表明，EAR在概念擦除效果和模型效用保持方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EAR为自回归模型中的概念擦除提供了有效的解决方案，并通过ECGVF基准验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

### [7] [UniCode$^2$: Cascaded Large-scale Codebooks for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20214)
*Yanzhe Chen,Huasong Zhong,Yan Li,Zhenheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCode^2提出了一种级联码本框架，用于大规模、语义对齐且稳定的视觉标记化，解决了现有方法在词汇量小或训练不稳定上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的方法要么词汇量小（约16K），缺乏细粒度语义，要么盲目扩展导致标记利用率低和训练不稳定。

Method: 通过聚类数百万SigLIP序列嵌入构建500K条目的码本，采用级联设计：冻结码本锚定嵌入空间，可训练码本优化任务特定语义。

Result: UniCode^2在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持高质量视觉合成，且无需牺牲稳定性、语义或模块性。

Conclusion: UniCode^2证明了在不牺牲稳定性、语义或模块性的情况下扩展视觉标记空间的可行性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

### [8] [Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria for Deep Neural Network Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20152)
*Deepak Ghimire,Kilho Lee,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的基于损失感知的自动结构化剪枝标准选择方法（LAASP），用于压缩和加速深度神经网络。该方法通过剪枝与训练相结合的方式，避免了传统三阶段剪枝流程，并自动选择剪枝标准和层，显著减少了计算量（FLOPs）同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统剪枝方法需要分阶段进行且剪枝标准选择依赖人工的问题，本文提出了一种自动化的剪枝方法，旨在更高效地压缩神经网络，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Method: 提出了一种剪枝与训练相结合的方法（LAASP），通过网络的整体损失自动选择剪枝标准和层，并在每次剪枝后短暂重训练以减少精度损失。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，ResNet56和ResNet110模型的FLOPs减少了52%，且精度优于现有方法；ResNet50模型的FLOPs减少了42%，仅损失0.33%的top-5精度。

Conclusion: LAASP方法通过自动化和高效的剪枝策略，显著减少了神经网络的计算复杂度，同时保持了高精度，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

### [9] [InvZW: Invariant Feature Learning via Noise-Adversarial Training for Robust Image Zero-Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20370)
*Abdullah All Tanvir,Xin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失真不变特征学习的深度学习框架，用于鲁棒图像零水印技术。该方法不修改原始图像，通过特征空间优化学习参考签名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统水印技术对图像修改的依赖问题，同时提高对失真的鲁棒性。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：1）通过噪声对抗学习训练特征提取器，生成对失真不变且语义丰富的表示；2）设计基于学习的多比特零水印方案，将特征投影到可训练的参考代码上。

Result: 在多种图像数据集和失真条件下，方法在特征稳定性和水印恢复方面达到最优鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在泛化能力和鲁棒性上优于现有自监督和深度水印技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

*Avadhoot Jadhav,Ashutosh Srivastava,Abhinav Java,Silky Singh,Tarun Ram Menta,Surgan Jandial,Balaji Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于示例对的图像编辑方法，利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型和多模态VLMs，无需优化即可实现高效编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅通过文本难以捕捉所有类型的图像编辑需求，示例对能更直观表达模糊的编辑意图。

Method: 利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型和多模态VLMs，构建端到端无优化的编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种编辑类型上优于基线方法，且速度快约4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于示例的图像编辑提供了高效且无需优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出KIE-HVQA基准测试，评估OCR幻觉问题，并引入GRPO框架以减少幻觉内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉退化场景下表现不完整，容易产生幻觉内容。

Method: 提出KIE-HVQA数据集和GRPO框架，结合视觉不确定性自感知和拒绝回答机制。

Result: 实验显示7B参数模型在KIE-HVQA上比GPT-4o提升22%的幻觉减少准确率。

Conclusion: GRPO框架有效减少幻觉，同时保持标准任务性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLADA框架通过处理压缩图像的块效应和利用成对与非成对数据，显著提升了OSNs中深度伪造图像的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法忽视压缩引入的块效应，且主要依赖原始图像，难以应对实际场景。

Method: PLADA包含块效应消除模块（B2E）和开放数据聚合模块（ODA），分别处理块效应和数据不足问题。

Result: 在26个数据集上，PLADA优于现有方法，尤其在压缩和有限成对数据条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: PLADA为开放场景下的深度伪造检测提供了鲁棒解决方案，并首次将块效应作为关键因素。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何通过结合预训练的基础模型提升地球观测任务的性能，发现特征级集成小模型可媲美或超越大模型，且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用现有预训练模型而非从头训练大模型，以提高地球观测任务的性能和效率。

Method: 使用GEO-Bench基准测试，评估Prithvi、Hiera和DOFA等模型在11个数据集上的表现，采用特征级集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 特征级集成小模型性能可媲美或超越大模型，且训练时间和计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏可将集成模型的优势转移到更紧凑的模型中，为实际应用提供可行路径。

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

Motivation: 手写识别通常仅利用单一模态（如离线图像或在线笔划数据），而忽略了互补信息。本文旨在通过融合两种模态提升识别性能。

Method: 设计了一个端到端网络，将离线图像和在线笔划数据在共享潜在空间中早期融合。使用补丁编码器和轻量级Transformer分别处理图像和笔划序列，并通过可学习的潜在查询联合关注两种模态。

Conclusion: 通过早期融合两种模态，显著提升了手写识别的性能和鲁棒性，同时展示了在ISI-Air数据集上的适应性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

Conclusion: HMDRN通过双层次重建增强类间区分，掩码增强减少类内差异，可视化结果证明了其优越的特征重建能力。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized
baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast,
DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of
baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment. Our

Result: 实验验证了该方法在注册和融合中的有效性，并提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 从光谱域解决注册问题更高效，结合BSF方法显著提升了融合质量和计算效率。

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中容易陷入局部最优解，导致全局不一致或条件不匹配。现有方法通过增强引导信号或调整初始噪声分布尝试解决，但效果有限。

Method: Ctrl-Z Sampling通过奖励模型识别局部最优解，注入噪声并回退到更早状态以逃离，动态交替前向细化和后向探索。

Result: 实验表明，Ctrl-Z Sampling显著提升生成质量，仅增加约7.6倍函数评估。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling是一种模型无关的方法，兼容现有扩散框架，有效提升生成对齐和视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly
available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined
with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

Result: 实验证明突发性广泛存在，抑制突发性显著提升了识别性能。

Conclusion: 通过检测和抑制突发性，可以有效提升基于集合的人脸识别性能。

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

Motivation: 历史文档布局复杂，需要鲁棒的文档布局分析（DLA）方法，但现有模型在不同数据集上的表现差异显著。

Method: 比较了两种Transformer模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO）和三种YOLO变体（AABB、OBB、YOLO-World）在三个数据集上的性能。

Result: Co-DETR在结构化数据集（e-NDP）表现最佳，而YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集（CATMuS、HORAE）上显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: Transformer适合结构化布局，CNN-OBB模型更适合复杂文档，OBB对历史文档分析至关重要。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激光雷达方法成本高，而基于RGB图像的深度学习方法难以准确提取冠层高度特征，因此需要一种更高效、低成本的方法。

Method: 结合特征提取器、自监督特征增强模块和高度估计器，利用1米分辨率的Google Earth图像生成CHM。

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

Med-Art adapts a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model, PixArt-$\alpha$,
based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), achieving high performance under

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

Motivation: 地下矿山中岩锚的频繁评估对维持岩体稳定性和降低风险至关重要，但传统手动检测方法在低光环境和耗时性上存在挑战，自动化检测成为必要。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习架构DeepBolt，专门设计用于处理严重类别不平衡问题，实现复杂3D点云中岩锚的自动识别。

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point
clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.
Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,
achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,
demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground
environments.

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用时间信息，保持轻量高效，并贡献了BOAT360数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: DaS框架通过结合视觉特征和语义信息，成功实现了密集视频字幕的生成。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过细粒度分割和语义关系建模，提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Conclusion: 深度学习在全向距离估计中具有潜力，适合低成本机器人、自主导航和监控应用。

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic
perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

Conclusion: 证明了高效、无需标注的架构潜力，为通用视频摘要技术开辟了新方向，挑战了对复杂架构的依赖。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: VIPScene利用视频生成模型的3D物理世界常识知识，结合文本和图像提示，实现高真实感和结构一致性的3D场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D场景合成需要专家知识和大量手动操作，自动化此过程对建筑设计、机器人仿真等领域有重要意义。现有方法（如LLMs或图像生成模型）在3D空间推理或多视角一致性上存在局限。

Method: VIPScene整合视频生成、前馈3D重建和开放词汇感知模型，通过语义和几何分析实现场景合成。引入FPVScore评估一致性和合理性。

Result: 实验表明VIPScene显著优于现有方法，并在多样化场景中表现良好。

Conclusion: VIPScene通过视频生成模型的优势，解决了3D场景合成中的一致性和真实性问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant
manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as
architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

Conclusion: Shape2Animal为视觉叙事、教育内容、数字艺术和交互媒体设计提供了新机会。

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous
stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces
Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting
natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible
animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary
segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive
media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

Motivation: 了解地球轨道物体的状态和行为对主动碎片清除、在轨维护和异常检测等应用至关重要，3D模型是空间态势感知（SSA）的重要信息来源。

Method: 使用NeRF进行3D重建，针对单色图像、未知物体方向、有限视角和无漫射光照等挑战，优化相机姿态与NeRF的联合训练。

Result: 实验表明，逐帧训练图像时能获得最准确的3D重建结果，通过均匀旋转优化相机姿态并使用正则化防止姿态变化过大。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下有效提升了非合作空间物体的3D重建精度。

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

Motivation: 显微镜图像分析在诊断、合成工程和环境监测中至关重要，但深度学习模型的可解释性仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用解耦表示学习（DRL）框架，通过从合成数据中学习表示迁移，提升模型的可解释性。

Result: 在浮游生物、酵母液泡和人类细胞三个显微镜图像数据集上，DRL框架实现了准确性与可解释性的良好平衡。

Conclusion: DRL方法为显微镜图像分类提供了一种兼具高准确性和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

<details>

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）和提示工程搜索代理的刚性流程导致搜索行为低效或过度，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出MMSearch-R1框架，结合图像和文本搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚机制指导模型动态调用搜索。

Result: 在知识密集和信息寻求VQA任务中，MMSearch-R1不仅优于同规模RAG基线，还能减少30%以上的搜索调用。

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1为多模态搜索研究提供了高效、按需的解决方案，并展示了强化学习在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPFormer提出了一种基于图像上下文自适应实例提案的方法，用于解决视觉3D全景场景补全问题，显著提升了性能并减少了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的全景场景补全（PSC）方法主要基于LiDAR，而基于相机图像的方法较少探索。此外，现有的Transformer方法在测试时使用静态查询，限制了动态适应场景的能力。

Method: IPFormer通过自适应初始化查询作为全景实例提案，并通过注意力编码和解码进一步优化，以推理语义实例-体素关系。

Result: IPFormer在整体全景指标PQ$^\dagger$和PQ-All上超越了现有方法，运行时间减少了14倍以上，动态实例提案显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: IPFormer首次引入了上下文自适应实例提案，为视觉3D全景场景补全提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高归因保真度的同时，显著提升了查询效率，为生成式问答系统的可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

Method: 开发了可监控能源使用和CO2排放的RAG框架，并基于开源LLM构建了多种RAG模型，与商业模型进行对比测试。

Result: 基于llama3.1:8B的RAG模型在准确性和能源效率上均优于商业模型，CO2排放最低。

Conclusion: 研究表明本地LLM构建的RAG在医疗任务中表现更优且环保，符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否会在身份诱导下表现出动机性推理，及其对社会议题的影响。

Method: 为8种LLMs分配4种政治和社会人口属性的人设，测试其在信息真实性辨别和科学证据评估任务中的表现。

Result: 身份诱导的LLMs在真实性辨别上表现下降9%，政治人设在科学证据评估中与身份一致的准确率提高90%。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出类似人类的动机性推理，传统去偏方法难以缓解，可能加剧身份一致的推理偏差。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR数据，显著提升了医疗大语言模型的临床实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,

OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Bloom分类法的14任务框架，评估LLM在企业环境中的能力，开发可扩展标注流程，构建9700样本基准，发现开源模型在推理任务中表现接近专有模型，但在判断任务中落后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如MMLU）未能充分评估企业特定任务的复杂性，需更全面的评估框架。

Method: 结合LLM-as-a-Labeler、LLM-as-a-Judge和CRAG技术，开发可扩展标注流程，构建9700样本基准。

Result: 开源模型（如DeepSeek R1）在推理任务中表现接近专有模型，但在判断任务中落后，可能因过度思考。

Conclusion: 为企业提供定制化评估蓝图，推动LLM的实际部署，并揭示性能差距与优化方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting
productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific
task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy
to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address
challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline
combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented
generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six
leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary
models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to
overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and
offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides
enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注离线强化学习或动作级奖励的在线优化，限制了代理与环境的动态交互，导致局部最优和探索能力不足。

Method: Mobile-R1采用三阶段训练框架：初始格式微调、动作级奖励的单步在线训练、基于多轮轨迹的任务级奖励在线训练。

Result: 显著提升了代理的探索和纠错能力，并公开了包含数据集、基准测试、模型权重和代码的资源。

Conclusion: Mobile-R1通过任务级奖励和多轮交互强化学习，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了移动代理的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

TL;DR: REFeat方法通过多类型推理引导LLM生成多样且信息丰富的特征，提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的特征生成方法常产生简单或重复特征，缺乏结构化推理指导。

Method: 提出REFeat方法，利用多种推理类型引导LLM生成特征。

Result: 在59个基准数据集上，REFeat不仅预测准确性更高，还发现了更多样且有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 结合丰富推理范式与自适应策略选择，REFeat为LLM驱动的特征发现提供了新方向。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

Conclusion: 该研究为智能、高利润的电动汽车移动系统提供了可行方案，同时支持电网优化。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

Motivation: 业务流程管理系统需要优化任务分配决策，现有工具无法完全支持部分流程可观察性和多决策建模。

Method: GymPN基于深度强化学习，扩展了先前任务分配方法，引入部分流程可观察性和多决策建模功能。

Result: 在八种典型业务流程决策问题模式上验证，GymPN能轻松建模问题并学习最优决策策略。

Conclusion: GymPN解决了先前工作的局限性，为业务流程决策提供了更现实的建模能力。

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

Motivation: 传统神经细胞自动机（NCA）的确定性限制了其对真实生物和物理系统随机性的建模能力。

Method: 提出MNCA框架，将混合模型的概念引入NCA，结合概率规则和固有噪声，模拟局部行为和生物过程的随机动态。

Result: 在组织生长模拟、图像形态生成鲁棒性和显微镜图像分割三个领域验证了MNCA的有效性，结果显示其具有更好的鲁棒性、更真实的生物生长模式重现能力以及可解释的规则分割。

Conclusion: MNCA为建模随机动力系统和研究自生长过程提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model
self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

Result: 明确了功能性感知的定义及其实现路径，为AI设计提供指导。

Conclusion: 理解功能性感知有助于避免无意中创造具有感知的AI，或及时发现其存在。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出Decrypto，一个基于游戏的多智能体推理和心智理论（ToM）基准测试平台，填补现有评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多智能体场景中的心智理论能力尚不明确，现有基准测试存在范围窄、数据泄露等问题。

Method: 设计Decrypto基准测试，结合认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: LLMs在多智能体游戏中的表现落后于人类和简单基线模型，且最新推理模型在ToM任务中表现不如旧模型。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和ToM评估的关键空白，为开发更好的智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

TL;DR: CycleDistill利用LLMs和少样本翻译生成高质量机器翻译系统，无需大量平行语料，仅需1-4个样本即可迭代生成合成数据，提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏平行语料，但LLMs的少样本翻译能力有限，需改进以接近专用MT系统。

Method: 通过零样本或少样本翻译从单语语料生成合成平行语料，迭代优化模型。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，首轮迭代平均提升20-30 chrF点，软max激活进一步改善质量。

Conclusion: CycleDistill为低资源语言提供高效MT解决方案，减少对平行语料的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏对结构化上下文和多跳信息的访问。现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法未能充分捕捉知识图谱中节点间的关系结构。

Method: 提出Inference-Scaled GraphRAG框架，结合顺序扩展（深度链式图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），在推理时进行扩展计算。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，该方法显著优于传统GraphRAG和基线图遍历方法，提升了多跳问答性能。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展是一种实用且与架构无关的解决方案，可提升LLM在结构化知识推理中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

TL;DR: Doc2Agent是一个可扩展的管道，用于从API文档构建工具调用代理，显著提升性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的API复杂且多样，现有工具集无法满足需求，需要从非结构化API文档中构建工具代理。

Method: Doc2Agent从API文档生成可执行工具，并通过代码代理迭代优化。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，性能提升55%，成本降低90%。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档大规模构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STReason结合大型语言模型和时空模型，实现多任务推理和复杂长形式推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空数据挖掘模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和复杂长形式推理能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: STReason利用上下文学习将自然语言查询分解为模块化程序，生成解决方案和详细解释，无需任务特定微调。

Result: 实验表明STReason在所有指标上显著优于先进LLM基线，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更强大、通用的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Motivation: 当前代码检索器过度依赖表面文本特征（如文档字符串、标识符名称）和文档偏见，影响了代码检索和生成的效果。

Method: 通过系统性地屏蔽特定特征但保持代码功能，分析代码检索行为，并提出SACL框架，通过增强语义信息减少偏见。

Result: SACL显著提升了代码检索性能（如HumanEval上Recall@1提升12.8%），并改善了代码生成效果（如HumanEval上Pass@1提升4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL通过引入语义信息有效减少了代码检索的偏见，显著提升了检索和生成性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

Conclusion: 语义表示学习为语言模型的潜在空间几何提供了新视角，有助于提升模型的解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,
compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel
perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

Motivation: 高维时间序列数据与自然语言的动态交互任务仍具挑战性，需要新的解决方案。

Result: ITFormer在QA准确性上显著优于基线模型，且仅增加不到1%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: 该研究为时间序列数据与自然语言的整合提供了高效范式，推动了多模态AI的研究与应用。

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in
multi-modal AI. More details about the project, including datasets and code,

TL;DR: 三阶段LLM框架显著提高放射报告校对的正预测值（PPV）并降低运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于错误率低，现有LLM校对放射报告的PPV有限，需改进框架以提升效率和成本效益。

Method: 比较三种LLM框架：单提示检测器、提取器加检测器、三阶段（提取器、检测器、假阳性验证器），评估PPV和运营成本。

Result: 三阶段框架PPV显著提升至0.159，成本降低42.6%，检测性能稳定。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架是AI辅助放射报告质量保证的有效策略。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性，同时显著减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估学习者的能力是教育领域的基本目标，尤其是对高阶能力的评估需求增加。虽然构建性反应测试有效，但人工评分成本高且耗时。IRT虽能从不完整数据估计能力，但随着缺失分数比例增加，准确性下降。

Method: 提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以解决稀疏或异构数据下传统数据增强技术不准确的问题。

Result: 该方法在能力估计中实现了高准确性，并显著减少了人工评分的工作量。

Conclusion: 通过结合自动评分技术，该方法为高效且准确的能力评估提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CCRS，一种基于预训练LLM的零样本评估框架，用于全面评估RAG系统的多维输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估方法在捕捉多维质量（如上下文连贯性、事实准确性）上存在不足，或效率低下。

Method: CCRS通过五个指标（CC、QR、ID、AC、IR）利用单一预训练LLM进行端到端评估。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上验证CCRS能有效区分系统性能，且计算效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供了一种实用、全面且高效的评估框架。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

TL;DR: AALC是一种轻量级的、基于准确性的长度奖励方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性，显著减少推理模型的响应长度，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过生成冗长的思维链获得强大的推理能力，但这种“过度思考”导致高延迟和成本，而准确性提升有限。

Method: AALC将验证准确性整合到奖励中，并采用动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟长度惩罚直到达到目标性能。

Result: 实验表明，AALC将响应长度减少50%以上，同时保持或提高准确性，并减少冗余推理模式。

Conclusion: AALC展示了基于奖励的策略在引导LRMs实现更高效、通用推理路径方面的潜力，但也可能牺牲部分可解释性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

TL;DR: SEED是一种结构编码器，通过四个阶段整合时间序列与语言模型，解决结构依赖与语义推理的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器缺乏语义推理能力，而语言模型无法直接处理时间序列数据，限制了统一预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED包含四个阶段：令牌感知编码器提取补丁、投影模块对齐补丁与语言模型嵌入、语义重编程机制映射补丁到任务原型、冻结语言模型进行预测。

Result: 实验表明SEED在多个数据集上优于基线方法，有效填补结构-语义建模的空白。

Conclusion: SEED通过模块化架构实现数值模式与语义推理的高效对齐，为统一预测系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

TL;DR: COIN是一个不确定性保护选择框架，通过统计校准阈值在用户指定的FDR约束下过滤生成的答案，提高样本保留率和预测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型不确定性量化中缺乏形式化保证的问题，特别是选择性预测中的错误发现率（FDR）控制。

Method: 采用统计方法（如Clopper-Pearson）校准阈值，估计校准集上的经验错误率，并建立真实错误率的高概率上限。

Result: COIN在风险控制、测试时保留合格答案的能力以及有限校准数据下的预测效率方面表现出色。

Conclusion: COIN框架具有扩展性和适应性，适用于多种应用场景，并能通过替代上限构造和UQ策略进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

Conclusion: 高质量且连贯的示例检索及其增强（如复述）对提升对话情感识别准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world

application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition

in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

Motivation: 探讨句子嵌入模型在语义相似性和下游任务（如机器翻译评估）中的表现差异，揭示语义属性与任务性能的复杂关系。

Method: 使用Costra数据集和STS基准进行内在评估，通过COMET指标进行外在评估。

Result: 内在语义相似性表现好的模型在下游任务中未必最优，而某些看似平滑的嵌入模型通过微调表现优异。

Conclusion: 语义属性与下游任务性能关系复杂，需进一步研究可操作语义或更深入的下游任务数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

Method: 采用多视角软标签方法，分析多个主观文本分类任务（如仇恨言论、讽刺等），并使用Jensen-Shannon Divergence和F1分数评估。

Result: 多视角方法更接近人类标签分布，分类性能优于传统方法，但在讽刺和立场检测等任务中置信度较低。

Conclusion: 多视角方法有助于开发更具包容性的模型，但需进一步解决高主观性任务中的置信度问题。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上实现了简洁推理、鲁棒性能和优化兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理集成显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块的自监督学习（SSL）融合方法，结合CNN-BiLSTM框架，用于非母语者的流利度评估，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动流利度评估（AFA）在捕捉非母语者的语音节奏、停顿和不流利性方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用分块方法，结合多种SSL模型（Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、WavLM），通过Silero-VAD分割语音，并使用CNN-BiLSTM框架融合特征。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8-4.2和6.2-4.0点。

Conclusion: 分块多SSL融合方法对流利度评估有效，但未来需探索其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着媒体叙事的快速演变，需要动态追踪其发展过程，而现有方法在成本或规模上存在限制。

Method: 结合大型语言模型的语言理解能力与主题模型的大规模适用性，通过叙事政策框架动态建模叙事变化。

Result: 在《华尔街日报》2009-2023年的语料中，大型语言模型能有效提取叙事变化，但在区分内容与叙事变化时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效追踪叙事演变，但需改进对内容与叙事变化的区分能力。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本通常难以获取，Biomed-Enriched提供了公开的大规模临床案例数据集，填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过大语言模型标注400K段落，再微调小模型扩展到PMC-OA语料库，提取高质量子集并进行质量过滤和领域上采样。

Result: 实验显示临床上采样提升MMLU ProfMed性能5%，教育质量过滤提升MedQA和MedMCQA性能1%，组合方法加速收敛。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched为生物医学预训练提供了高效策略，是生物医学NLP的宝贵资源。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them

in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool

personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断因临床异质性、低患病率和医生对罕见病的了解有限而具有挑战性。

Method: DeepRare由中央主机、长期记忆模块和多个专用代理服务器组成，整合了40多种工具和最新医学知识。

Result: 在8个数据集上评估，DeepRare在2919种疾病中表现优异，部分疾病准确率达100%，显著优于其他15种方法。

Conclusion: DeepRare是一种高效、透明的罕见病诊断工具，已实现为易用的网络应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在安全关键应用中广泛使用，需提升其能力的同时确保与人类价值观和偏好的一致性。

Method: 通过CoDoT将自然语言输入转换为简单代码形式，评估LLMs的安全性。

Result: 实验显示，CoDoT导致多种先进LLMs（如GPT-4 Turbo、DeepSeek R1）的毒性显著增加，平均毒性提升300%。

Conclusion: CoDoT揭示了当前LLMs安全性的不足，强调了从基本原理出发评估安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

Motivation: 研究对话中说话时间的分配及其动态变化对参与者感知的影响，为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供新工具。

Method: 引入计算框架，量化对话层面的说话时间分布及其动态变化，并通过大规模视频聊天数据集验证。

Result: 平衡的对话更受欢迎，尤其是说话较少的一方；即使总体平衡相同，不同的动态类型也会影响参与者感知。

Conclusion: 框架为设计人机交互平台提供了新工具，强调了说话时间动态类型的重要性。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

Motivation: 大语言模型的高计算成本限制了部署和推理，现有方法主要关注单一模型剪枝，无法充分利用微调变体的能力。

Method: 将模型压缩问题转化为零阶优化问题，支持层移除、层选择和层合并三种操作。

Result: 在Llama2-13B模型上，压缩模型保留了97.3%的性能，同时减少了25%的参数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该策略有效平衡了模型压缩与性能保持，为高效部署大语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

Motivation: LLMs在动态API环境中因依赖过时训练数据而表现不佳，需改进其适应能力。

Method: 构建数据集训练LLMs，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升LLMs在动态API场景中的表现，且不影响其通用代码生成能力。

Conclusion: ReCode为LLMs适应API变化提供有效解决方案，实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Result: 发现高质量数学语料和长链推理数据能提升RL性能，但需注意数据格式化；提出的策略显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 两阶段中训练策略OctoThinker缩小了与RL友好模型的性能差距，为RL时代的基础模型预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

Method: 将代理行为引导问题建模为模型编辑任务，并引入多层次的基准BehaviorBench，基于心理学道德理论评估和编辑代理行为。

Result: 行为编辑能动态调整代理在特定场景中的行为，并实现全局道德对齐的广泛调整，既能促进伦理行为，也能诱导有害行为。

Conclusion: 行为编辑为代理行为引导提供了新范式，展示了其潜力与风险。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to

are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

TL;DR: Memento是一种提示策略，通过分解复杂问题、动态构建事实数据库并整合信息，显著提升LLMs在多跳问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在纯推理任务中表现优异，但在需要紧密耦合检索与推理的多跳问答任务中表现不佳。

Method: Memento采用三阶段策略：分解问题、动态构建事实数据库、整合信息解决问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著优于现有方法，如PhantomWiki上性能翻倍，2WikiMultiHopQA上提升20 F1点。

Conclusion: Memento是一种有效的策略，能显著提升LLMs在多跳问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在权衡社交与信息效用时是否表现出类似人类的决策行为，并利用认知模型评估了不同模型设置下的价值权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具在解释LLMs中动态、多方面的价值权衡方面有限，而认知科学中的认知模型为人类行为提供了形式化解释。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用认知模型分析LLMs的价值权衡，评估了前沿黑盒模型中的推理“努力”程度和开源模型的RL训练动态。

Result: 发现推理模型更注重信息效用，而开源模型在数学推理中表现更强；训练动态显示早期价值权衡变化显著，受基础模型和预训练数据影响较大。

Conclusion: 该方法对快速发展的LLM领域具有广泛适用性，为模型训练和价值观权衡控制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing
prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal
prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or
methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest,
can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a
stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set.
We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several
refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has
raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions
associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for
measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic
metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among
them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the
measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware
performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly
integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports
and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and
reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth
correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus
facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By
addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the

Result: 在MuQNOL数据集上表现与现有检索系统相当，支持精确和近似相似性检索。

Conclusion: FemmIR在标注稀缺的实际应用中具有潜力，且无需微调即可复用现有属性标识符。

Abstract: Existing multi-media retrieval models either rely on creating a common
subspace with modality-specific representation models or require schema mapping
among modalities to measure similarities among multi-media data. Our goal is to
avoid the annotation overhead incurred from considering retrieval as a
supervised classification task and re-use the pretrained encoders in large
language models and vision tasks. We propose "FemmIR", a framework to retrieve
multimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal
queries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is
necessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and
satisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common
framework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for
benchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision
introduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be
modified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its
properties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the
amount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding
networks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property
value and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between
data samples and the query example provided by the user. We empirically
evaluate FemmIR on a missing person use case with MuQNOL. FemmIR performs
comparably to similar retrieval systems in delivering on-demand retrieval
results with exact and approximate similarities while using the existing
property identifiers in the system.

introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic

properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and
generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent
scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in
most scenarios.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the
energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to
new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade.
This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient
energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research
interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence
(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy
market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and
market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2
million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American
microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record
contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume
(kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier
(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement
confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior
metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical
pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of
two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer,
each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing
and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this
research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in

Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern
insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance
management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and
efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the
absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable
to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach
to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate
that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model
details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a
99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and
claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially
bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent
need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against
adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of
different insurance systems.

Conclusion: 呼吁在机器学习和安全领域的交叉研究中采用严格方法，为未来权重发布方案的设计和评估提供蓝图。

Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model
distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However,
these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal
security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we
formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several
concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility
through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme.
Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus
showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope
this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine
learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight
release schemes should be designed and evaluated.

One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on
the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and
generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP
and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic
recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall
accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false
alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best,
demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.

Conclusion: RCG方法能有效且隐蔽地防御PVA，攻击失败。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact
on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the
remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA),
revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing
defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which
requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense
performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective
defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of
PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on
retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly
defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to
rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed
database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve
the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments"
are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to
responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the
attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight
popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of
the proposed defense method.

Conclusion: RepuNet具有适应性、鲁棒性和实际潜力，适用于去中心化联邦学习环境中的威胁缓解。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train
models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each
node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may
exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying
model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive
messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often
depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as
blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a
decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically
evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,
message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model
aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was
integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to
25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack
intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results
demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,
achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for
CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness,
and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated
learning environments.

Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical
imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due
to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and
adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced
reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond
monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.

Result: 实验证明该方法能以最小交互有效规避检测，计算成本低且部署性强。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络流量中的对抗攻击提供了新理解，为开发鲁棒防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead
intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical
gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,
particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent
features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in
current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.
Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that
addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system
access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box
constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect
real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using
change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive
features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational
cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's
effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its
adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the
understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a
foundation for developing robust defenses.

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Motivation: 解决模板基GFlowNets中的三个核心挑战：最小化合成成本、扩展到大型构建块库以及有效利用小片段集。

Method: 采用递归成本指导框架和动态库机制，结合机器学习模型近似合成成本和可行性。

Result: 显著提高了成本效率、分子多样性和质量，并在模板基分子生成中取得最先进成果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过平衡探索与利用，优化合成路径，为药物设计提供了高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PSALM-V是一种自主神经符号学习系统，通过交互在视觉环境中推断符号动作语义，无需专家定义，利用LLM生成启发式计划和符号语义，显著提升任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在文本领域或依赖不现实假设（如预定义问题文件、完全可观察性）的局限性，实现视觉环境中的动态符号规划。

Method: 动态推断PDDL问题文件和动作语义，通过分析执行结果和合成错误解释，迭代生成和执行计划，维护动作语义的树状信念。

Result: 在ALFRED任务中，计划成功率从37%提升至74%；在RTFM和Overcooked-AI中提升步骤效率并实现多智能体领域的归纳；在机器人BlocksWorld任务中成功推断PDDL条件。

Conclusion: PSALM-V在视觉和多智能体环境中高效推断符号语义，显著提升任务完成率和适应性。

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

TL;DR: 研究评估机器学习模型在检测人机对话中的沟通错误时的表现，发现模型和人类均难以准确识别机器人错误，揭示了用户反馈不足的根本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人机交互中检测沟通错误对维持用户参与和信任至关重要，但机器人难以通过非语言反馈识别错误。

Method: 使用包含240段人机对话的多模态数据集，引入四种对话失败类型，评估计算机视觉模型的性能，并与人类评估者对比。

Result: 模型和人类均仅能识别约一半的沟通错误，表明用户反馈不足是主要限制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了识别机器人沟通错误的根本限制，为设计更好的人机对话提供了方向。

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度物体姿态估计器过度自信的问题，避免高不确定性下的任务失败。

Method: 训练轻量级深度网络，利用真实图像和模拟抓取生成的数据预测抓取成功概率。

Result: 网络能从多样化的物体数据中学习，共同训练所有物体有助于提升性能。

Conclusion: 多样化的物体数据可以共同服务于同一目标，提升抓取预测的准确性。

Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent
that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the
uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act
under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and
uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have
connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method
for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an
image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We
generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real
images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object
variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects
jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless
contribute to the same goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四足机器人在复杂地形中运动的挑战，提高其运动效率和安全性。

Method: 采用两层分层结构：高层策略（HLP）选择目标，低层策略（LLP）执行动作。LLP通过基于策略的actor-critic算法训练，HLP则通过在线优化LLP的价值函数运行。

Result: 与端到端强化学习方法相比，该框架在多种地形（包括训练中未遇到的更复杂地形）上实现了更高的奖励和更少的碰撞。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习框架显著提升了四足机器人在复杂地形中的运动性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a
two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals
for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy
actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose
an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and
instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value
function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing
it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe
improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions
across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than
any encountered during training.

Result: 实验显示地图质量显著提升（FID改进24.44%近端，75.59%远端），探索结果更一致。

Conclusion: SceneSense增强的地图能提升机器人探索的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using
generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model
designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial
observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions
into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant
improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard
a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that
occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully
observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59%
improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating
SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map
improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in
improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of
full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar
environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent
exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在实时人类感知任务中的性能和延迟问题，以提升人机交互（HRI）体验。

Method: 构建HRIBench基准测试，包含1000个视觉问答（VQA）问题，覆盖五个HRI关键领域，并评估11种VLMs。

Result: 当前VLMs在核心感知能力和性能-延迟权衡上表现不佳，不适合实时部署。

Conclusion: 未来需开发更小、低延迟的VLMs，HRIBench为相关研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Real-time human perception is crucial for effective human-robot interaction
(HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable
perceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively
impacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.
To systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and
performance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual
question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse
set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key
domains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction
understanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social
navigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected
data from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue
understanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four
domains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of
1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
both state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.
Our results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still
struggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of
the models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory
performance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring
the need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with
improved human perception capabilities. HRIBench and our results can be found
in this Github repository: https://github.com/interaction-lab/HRIBench.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够有效提升机械臂动作的精度和可预测性。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the
trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To
highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and
implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental
setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was
characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise
linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during
its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes
the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial
dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through
the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in
terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach
successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their
shape and adapted to different settings.

Method: CARMA通过唯一标识物理实体并将其组织为行动者-对象-动作三元组，实现情境感知。

Result: 实验验证了系统在角色区分、多行动者感知和实例识别方面的能力，能可靠生成准确的三元组。

Conclusion: CARMA为需要时空推理和情境决策的协作应用提供了结构化且鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group
interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires
situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons
and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and
manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of
instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects,
and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies
physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into
grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple
humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.
These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role
distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our
experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate
actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for
applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in
collaborative settings.

<details>

Motivation: 政府企业软件常使用遗留语言（如MUMPS或ALC），现有LLMs未充分测试这些语言，且其上下文窗口不足以处理长代码。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了多种代码分块方法，评估不同LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等）在生成遗留代码摘要注释时的表现。

Result: LLMs选择的分区点与专家选择高度一致，且生成的注释比人工分区更准确（高20%）和实用（高10%）。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为人工分区的替代方案，适用于大型代码库的现代化过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,
especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,
existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code
written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise
software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language
code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context
window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are
primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited
testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy
languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines
the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written
in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We
investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary
module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking
methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs
can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We
also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks
such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that
are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create
partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable
replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided
modernization.

environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office
building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and
effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined
the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions,
material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships
and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system
eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured
reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and

Conclusion: Define-ML为ML产品构思提供了开放且验证过的解决方案，增强了Lean Inception的敏捷性并提高了技术可行性意识。

Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software
systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific
challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment
between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional
ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML
considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic
expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends
Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data
Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical
constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and
validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both
static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world
industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with
qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.
[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,
aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional
collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,
though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be
mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to
adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated
approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while
aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical
feasibility.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

*Runlong Ye,Zeling Zhang,Boushra Almazroua,Michael Liut*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CopilotLens是一个交互式框架，通过透明的解释层揭示AI代码助手的决策过程，提升开发者对代码生成的理解和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代码助手缺乏解释性，开发者难以评估其输出和建立信任，CopilotLens旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CopilotLens作为解释层，通过动态两级界面展示AI的“思考过程”，包括高层计划和代码库上下文。

Result: CopilotLens提供了一个透明、可解释的代码完成框架，促进开发者与AI的深度协作。

Conclusion: CopilotLens为未来注重推理透明性的代码助手设计提供了框架，强调理解而非速度。

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions,
significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically
present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their
decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability
to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build
calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a
novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple
suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an
explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a
dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed
high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This
paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete
framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity
of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension
and more robust human-AI collaboration.

*Xuefei Hou,Xizhao Tan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Insight Recall'的新范式，通过上下文触发的个人过去见解检索来支持自我调节学习（SRL），并开发了原型系统Irec。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字工具在支持元认知反思方面不足，如Spaced Repetition Systems（SRS）缺乏上下文，Personal Knowledge Management（PKM）工具维护成本高。

Method: 采用Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention（JITAI）框架，构建动态知识图谱和混合检索引擎，结合LLM进行深度相似性评估，并设计了'Guided Inquiry'模块。

Result: 开发了Irec系统，展示了新范式的可行性，提供了增强元认知和自我调节的理论框架和系统平台。

Conclusion: 论文为下一代智能学习系统设计提供了理论支持和实用工具，有望提升学习者的元认知能力。

Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to
effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting
on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support
metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized
review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel
paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past
insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm
using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a
prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses
a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a
new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights."
Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity
assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time
manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline
for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided
Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert
LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The
contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system
platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that
enhance metacognition and self-regulation.

TL;DR: 研究表明，精心设计的AI写作支持工具比聊天式LLM更能增强学生的写作自主性和知识转化深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同AI支持方式对学生写作自主性和知识转化深度的影响。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，比较聊天式LLM写作助手、集成AI写作工具和标准写作界面的效果。

Result: 使用集成AI工具的学生表现出更强的写作自主性和更深的知识转化。

Conclusion: 针对写作过程特定方面设计的AI支持工具有助于学生保持对作品的所有权，同时提升内容参与度。

Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their
impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and
superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often
produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully
designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper
investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of
agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control
trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a
chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support
diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our
findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the
integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process
and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest
that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the
writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while
facilitating improved engagement with content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程皮肤病学中图像质量差是一个未解决的问题，影响了远程咨询的效果。现有的皮肤病学IQA研究未能充分利用非皮肤病学IQA的最新进展。

Method: 通过创建新的皮肤病学IQA数据库（Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial），并结合非皮肤病学IQA数据集，进行跨领域训练。

Result: 跨领域训练在多个领域中表现最优，克服了皮肤病学IQA数据规模小的限制，并提升了图像质量管理的效果。

Conclusion: 跨领域训练方法显著提升了皮肤病学IQA的性能，为远程皮肤病学中的图像质量管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily
clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with
in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in
teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images
reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on
Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage
the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image
databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we
propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and
non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology
IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from
several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We
demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across
domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which
is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of
image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the
teledermatology process.

Conclusion: FundaQ-8提升了糖尿病视网膜病变分级的诊断鲁棒性，强调了质量感知训练在筛查应用中的价值。

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy
grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of
quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

TL;DR: VoxelOpt是一种结合学习与迭代方法的变形图像配准框架，通过位移熵和多级图像金字塔优化，实现了精度与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于学习的方法在训练数据有限、大变形和无标签监督时性能不足的问题，同时避免迭代方法的速度劣势。

Method: 使用位移熵测量信号强度，引入体素自适应消息传递、多级图像金字塔和预训练分割模型提取特征。

Result: 在腹部CT配准中，VoxelOpt在效率和精度上均优于领先的迭代方法，并匹配有监督学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: VoxelOpt通过结合学习与迭代方法的优势，实现了变形图像配准的高效与高精度。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度特征融合网络MS-IQA，用于PET/CT图像质量评估，结合高低层次特征，并通过动态加权通道注意力机制优化融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法无法同时考虑低层次失真特征和高层次解剖结构特征，可能导致诊断不确定性。

Method: 利用ResNet和Swin Transformer的多尺度特征，设计动态加权通道注意力机制融合高低层次信息。

Result: 在自建数据集PET-CT-IQA-DS和公开数据集LDCTIQAC2023上，MS-IQA性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-IQA为PET/CT提供了一种高效准确的图像质量评估方法，填补了数据集空白。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical
role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid
in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise,
compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty
and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT
image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like
organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However,
existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account
for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel
multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale
features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer,
enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In
addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively
combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted
channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset,
we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT
images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset
and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed
model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art
methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient
IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 骨质疏松诊断在资源有限地区面临挑战，现有方法存在未标记数据利用不足、设备偏差和临床知识整合不足的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习框架为骨质疏松的筛查和诊断提供了更高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and
compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations.
While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD
assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited
regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a
promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data.
Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of
unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA
discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as
spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep
learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning
method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and
preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with
learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a
multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD
regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical
sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior
generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic
osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肝包虫病在医疗资源匮乏地区的诊断问题，克服CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中的局限性。

Method: 采用U形网络结构，结合PVSS编码器和HVSS解码器，引入CVSSB和HWTB模块融合局部与全局特征。

Result: 在260例患者CT数据上，EAGLE的DSC为89.76%，优于MSVM-UNet。

Conclusion: EAGLE在肝包虫病病灶分割中表现优异，为资源匮乏地区提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in
underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based
and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image
segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,
and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are
computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,
have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear
complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a
Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space
(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate
segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional
Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global
features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses
spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.
Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from
260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Conclusion: 该框架为孕龄估计提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound
measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care.
However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the
operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are
demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion
framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement
information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations
from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and
characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of
radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic
features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean
absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current
machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in
diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像分辨率低且噪声多，影响生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）的准确性，现有PC-MRA方法在分割任务中存在不足。

Method: 引入WMF特征，通过加权平均频率揭示脉冲流经过的三维区域，并采用最优阈值和深度学习方法进行分割实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，WMF特征在IoU和Dice指标上分别提高了0.12和0.13，优于PC-MRA。

Conclusion: WMF特征有望为其他血管区域（如心脏或大脑）的分割任务提供新思路。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用QNN改进倾向得分估计，以解决小样本高维数据集中的因果推断问题，特别是在生物医学研究中。

Method: 使用线性ZFeatureMap编码数据，SummedPaulis算子进行预测，CMA-ES进行优化，并集成方差正则化以减轻量子噪声。在模拟和噪声硬件条件下测试。

Result: QNN在小样本中表现优于经典方法（AUC达0.750），噪声建模提高了稳定性。倾向得分匹配和加权后，生存分析未显示显著差异。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for
propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival
outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177
colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava
(2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics
and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models
focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture
employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for
predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance
regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with
simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware
(FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,
outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in
small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing
predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via
genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with
standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival
analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen
additive regression revealed no significant survival differences
post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in
unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by
CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical
research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN)
architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the
EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of
data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500
distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of
influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were
benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same
architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant
factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In
contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a
comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining
below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding,
performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the
data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation
accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.

Conclusion: 皮质锥体神经元可能是意识生成和控制的核心细胞，验证了Cajal的假说。

Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable
neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an
unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our
understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the
brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic
cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an
intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of
feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.
Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the

TL;DR: MNN-AECS是一种无需root或操作系统修改的引擎级系统解决方案，通过动态选择低功耗CPU核心，显著降低LLM解码能耗，同时保持解码速度在可接受范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着设备端大型语言模型（LLM）推理需求的增长，能效成为主要关注点，尤其是电池有限的移动设备。现有工作多关注加速预填充阶段，而忽略了内存绑定的解码阶段的能耗问题。

Method: 提出Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection (AECS)方法，并将其集成到MNN中，形成MNN-AECS系统，动态选择低功耗CPU核心以减少能耗。

Result: 在5款Android和2款iOS设备上测试5种不同规模的流行LLM，MNN-AECS平均降低23%能耗且无速度损失；与其他引擎相比，能耗节省39%-78%，速度提升12%-363%。

Conclusion: MNN-AECS是一种高效节能的LLM解码解决方案，适用于移动设备，无需系统级修改即可显著提升能效。

Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows,
energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited
mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase
dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the
prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric
Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient
version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring
root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is
designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an
acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.
MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of
various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23%
without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other
engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS
delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.

### [148] [DeepQuark: deep-neural-network approach to multiquark bound states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555)
*Wei-Lin Wu,Lu Meng,Shi-Lin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络的变分蒙特卡洛方法DeepQuark，用于研究多夸克束缚态，解决了传统方法难以处理的强关联和复杂相互作用问题，并在多个系统中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多夸克系统的复杂性远超电子或核子系统，传统方法难以处理其强关联和额外离散量子数等问题，需要一种高效的新方法。

Method: 设计了DeepQuark架构，结合深度神经网络和变分蒙特卡洛方法，有效处理多夸克系统的强关联、离散量子数和禁闭相互作用。

Result: 在核子、双重重四夸克和全重重四夸克系统中表现优异，尤其在五夸克系统中优于现有方法，并成功预测了新的分子态。

Conclusion: DeepQuark为研究更大规模多夸克系统和探索非微扰QCD提供了强大工具，有望推动多体物理的发展。

Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational
Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity
surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color
interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to
address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger
correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement
interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with
state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian
expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy
tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for
pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we
successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without
additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe
hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased
form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound
$\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its
bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the
molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in
the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for
extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers
in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring
confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which
may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body
physics.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在加速核聚变和裂变研究中的潜力。

Method: 14个跨学科团队使用ChatGPT、Gemini等AI模型，结合提示工程和迭代优化，探索核科学挑战。

Result: LLMs在早期探索和文献合成中表现优异，但在新材料设计和高级代码生成方面需专家验证。

Conclusion: AI可作为核能研究的补充工具，但需核专用数据集和模型开发以进一步整合。

Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission
research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science
challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized
model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools
into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for
safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous
scientific standards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时空点过程的阅读行为概率模型，捕捉注视点的空间和时间动态，使用Hawkes过程建模扫视行为，发现其对人类扫视行为的拟合优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统阅读行为建模方法依赖聚合的眼动数据，忽略了时空动态，本文旨在提出更通用的模型以更好地理解阅读行为。

Method: 采用标记的时空点过程模型，Hawkes过程建模扫视行为，注视持续时间通过时间卷积的预测变量建模。

Result: Hawkes过程模型在扫视行为拟合上优于基线模型，但上下文惊奇度对注视持续时间的预测改进有限。

Conclusion: 惊奇度理论难以解释精细的眼动行为，Hawkes过程模型为阅读行为提供了更全面的建模框架。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

Conclusion: 多模态学习有望推动多个领域发展，未来或使AI系统更接近人类的理解能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

Motivation: 多目标优化（MOO）在机器学习、运筹学和工程中有广泛应用，但现有方法在收敛速度和样本复杂度上表现不佳。

Method: STIMULUS采用递归框架更新随机梯度估计，STIMULUS-M加入动量项加速收敛，STIMULUS+/STIMULUS-M+引入自适应批处理减少全梯度评估需求。

Conclusion: STIMULUS系列算法在多目标优化中表现出色，显著提升了收敛性能和样本效率。

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Koopman理论的飞行轨迹预测模型效率低、可解释性差且计算量大，亟需改进。

Method: 结合HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和状态空间方程，直接通过数据构建Koopman算子，减少可训练参数。

Result: FlightKooba在时间和内存消耗上表现优越（训练时间与Mamba模块相当，内存减少50%以上，参数数量减少十倍）。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为Koopman算子的快速计算提供了新方法，为时间序列预测与控制的结合开辟了新可能。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了带宽、CPU频率与用户感知之间的因果关系，限制了QoE提升。

Method: 结合Weber-Fechner定律制定QoE度量，使用PS-CDDPG算法优化关键帧比例、带宽和计算资源。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低延迟、提升QoE并保持公平性，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 提出的因果感知强化学习框架在多用户VR交互中有效优化了QoE。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

Conclusion: 为MLaaS场景提供高效、实用的实时机器遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

Motivation: 由于AI生成内容（AIGC）激增，从云端传输到边缘和移动用户导致网络流量剧增，现有GSC方法在知识对齐方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出DeKA-g算法，包括元词辅助知识蒸馏（MAKD）和可变率分组SNR自适应（VGSA），优化知识对齐和传输效率。

Result: 实验显示DeKA-g将边缘与云端生成图像对齐度提升44%，压缩率效率提高116%，低SNR条件下性能提升28%。

Conclusion: DeKA-g有效解决了GSC中的知识对齐问题，显著提升了生成内容的一致性和传输效率。

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Conclusion: DNN与XAI的结合不仅提高了价格预测的准确性，还增强了对电力市场运作机制的理解，为未来研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to

### [160] [A Framework for Uncertainty Quantification Based on Nearest Neighbors Across Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19895)
*Miguel N. Font,José L. Jorro-Aragoneses,Carlos M. Alaíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于训练案例检索的后处理框架，通过测量决策变化和层不确定性来增强神经网络的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断或自动驾驶）中的错误决策可能带来严重后果，因此需要有效的不确定性测量方法。

Method: 通过检索与查询具有相似激活向量的训练案例，提出两种新指标：决策变化和层不确定性，用于捕捉跨层最近邻类别分布的变化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的分类模型中，新指标优于基于softmax的置信度方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升不确定性估计，尤其在复杂分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

*Matthieu Meeus,Igor Shilov,Georgios Kaissis,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习模型记忆训练数据的机制，指出仅依赖自影响（self-influence）会低估记忆风险，需考虑全影响分布（full influence distribution）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型记忆训练数据引发隐私和泛化问题，现有方法仅关注自影响，忽略了其他训练样本（如近重复样本）的影响。

Method: 通过计算小型语言模型中训练样本间的全影响分布，分析其特性，并在图像分类任务（CIFAR-10）中验证。

Result: 发现仅关注自影响会低估记忆风险，近重复样本的存在显著降低自影响但仍可被提取；图像分类中也观察到类似模式。

Conclusion: 记忆行为源于训练数据间的复杂交互，全影响分布比自影响更能准确捕捉记忆现象。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

TL;DR: 本文研究了介于离策略强化学习和监督微调之间的算法，通过分析一种简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，探讨了基线V对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离策略方法在实现简单性和数据效率上优于同策略方法，但性能往往不理想。本文旨在通过调整基线V来优化离策略RL的性能。

Method: 提出了一种简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，其中优势定义为A=r-V，通过调整V来强调高奖励样本或惩罚低奖励样本。

Result: 理论分析表明，当基线V低于预期奖励时，算法具有策略改进保证。实验验证了在随机多臂老虎机任务和LLM微调中的有效性。

Conclusion: 离策略更新应更关注正奖励信号，而非负信号。调整基线V可以显著提升离策略RL的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过将掩码扩散模型（MDM）置于解码器框架中，公平比较了自回归（AR）和MDM范式，并探讨了架构对MDM的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AR和MDM范式时，由于架构差异（解码器vs编码器），直接比较不公平。研究旨在区分范式差异和架构影响。

Method: 在解码器框架中评估MDM，将其视为任意顺序自回归（AO-AR），并与标准AR范式比较。同时研究架构（解码器vs编码器）对MDM的影响。

Result: 解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（约25倍），且困惑度与编码器MDM相当，但建模空间更大。AO-AR目标可能需优化。

Conclusion: 研究解耦了范式差异和架构影响，为未来模型设计提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

TL;DR: PLoP（精确LoRA放置）是一种轻量级方法，通过自动识别模块类型来优化LoRA适配器的放置策略，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA适配器放置策略缺乏明确指导，不同研究结果不一致，需要一种自动化的优化方法。

Method: 通过直观的理论分析，提出PLoP方法，自动识别适合放置LoRA适配器的模块类型。

Result: PLoP在监督微调和强化学习任务中表现优于或至少与常用策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP为LoRA适配器放置提供了高效且自动化的解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 复杂数据集的爆炸式增长需要既能有效分组又能提供人类可理解洞察的工具。

Result: HERCULES能够从复杂数据集中提取有意义的分层知识，并通过交互式可视化工具增强分析。

Conclusion: HERCULES为复杂数据集的分层分析和解释提供了高效且可理解的解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）面临非独立同分布数据的挑战，现有方法难以同时兼顾全局模型的泛化能力和局部模型的性能，且引入公共数据集可能增加数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出FedBKD框架，利用GAN生成合成数据，局部模型作为判别器并冻结参数，通过合成数据实现全局与局部模型的双向知识蒸馏。

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FedBKD在不同non-IID设置下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FedBKD有效解决了FL中的non-IID问题，同时提升了全局和局部模型的性能，且避免了数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习代理在未见环境中的泛化问题，现有UED方法仅依赖价值函数损失衡量学习潜力，存在局限性。

Method: 提出TRACED方法，结合转移预测误差和共学习性指标，优化课程设计。

Result: 实验表明TRACED在多个基准测试中提升零样本泛化能力，且环境交互需求减少至基线的一半。

Conclusion: 通过精细的遗憾近似和任务关系建模，TRACED实现了高效的课程设计。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Method: 利用深度展开技术，客户端自主优化学习率和正则化因子等超参数，动态适应训练行为。

Result: 在IBM量子硬件和Qiskit Aer模拟器上实现约90%的准确率，显著优于传统方法的55%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应的微调，在基因表达分析和癌症检测等关键应用中表现出色，解决了传统量子联邦学习的核心限制。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在高维混沌系统中难以建模复杂时间依赖性和不确定性增长，滚动扩散框架与高性能扩散技术的结合具有挑战性。

Method: ERDM通过改进噪声调度、网络预处理和采样器，结合新的损失加权方案、预训练初始化策略和混合序列架构，实现滚动预测。

Result: 在2D Navier-Stokes模拟和ERA5全球天气预报中，ERDM表现优于其他扩散基线模型。

Conclusion: ERDM为扩散模型在序列生成问题中建模不确定性提供了灵活且强大的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，任务分配需要考虑环境变化和代理能力差异，因此需要多样化的COA池以提高任务完成率。

Result: 模拟测试显示，该方法在任务完成率和多样性上显著优于随机基线，且执行时间合理。

Conclusion: 该框架为多代理任务分配提供了高效且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

Result: Transformer模型能够从英语丰富的训练数据泛化到其他语言和随机字符串，且解码机制与传统QR码阅读器不同。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在QR码解码中表现出色，揭示了其独特的学习机制和泛化能力。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

Conclusion: LSH-DynED是一种有效且鲁棒的方法，适用于多类不平衡非平稳数据流分类，为未来研究提供了指导和实现基础。

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Anubis的零样本归因工具，通过假设检验和分布测试方法，解决了从大型语言模型（LLM）生成的代码的归因问题。实验表明，Anubis在区分不同LLM生成的代码时表现优异（AUROC≥0.9）。


<details>

Motivation: 随着越来越多的代码由LLM生成，如何准确归因代码来源成为一个重要问题。论文旨在通过假设检验和分布测试方法解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出Anubis工具，将归因问题转化为分布测试问题，利用LLM的样本和密度估计进行零样本归因。

Result: 在区分DeepSeek-Coder、CodeGemma和Stable-Coder等LLM生成的代码时，Anubis仅需约2000个样本即可达到高AUROC分数（≥0.9）。

Conclusion: Anubis是一种有效的零样本归因工具，能够高效区分不同LLM生成的代码，为代码来源归因提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Affective Priming Score（APS）的数据驱动方法，用于检测受情感启动效应影响的数据点，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中情感启动效应的模糊性挑战尚未充分探索，尤其是其对生理信号数据的影响，可能导致模型误分类。

Method: 提出APS方法，为每个数据点分配分数以量化启动效应影响，并在SEED和SEED-VII数据集上验证。

Result: 使用去启动效应数据序列显著降低了模型的误分类率。

Conclusion: APS方法通过数据层面识别和缓解启动效应，提升了模型鲁棒性，并为情感计算数据集设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Conclusion: 融合特征嵌入与社区信息的GNN框架能有效提升有向链接预测性能。

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在模型多重性（MM）下提供反事实解释（CEs）的方法，称为recourse-aware ensembling（RAE），通过计算论证确保CE的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，模型多重性（MM）导致不同模型对同一输入的预测结果不同，使得反事实解释（CEs）的鲁棒性难以保证。

Method: 提出了一种基于计算论证的集成方法，显式表示模型与反事实之间的冲突，并通过论证语义解决冲突。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法在四种论证语义下有效，并通过八种实例验证了其满足预期性质。

Conclusion: 该方法在MM下提供了鲁棒的反事实解释，并允许对模型偏好进行定制。

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

Motivation: 模仿学习在有限演示数据下难以准确学习专家策略，且需要探索环境以实现超越专家性能。

Method: ILDE算法结合乐观策略优化（奖励高不确定性的状态-动作对）和好奇心驱动探索（探索偏离演示轨迹的状态）。

Result: ILDE在Atari和MuJoCo任务中样本效率更高，且能以更少的演示实现超越专家性能。

Conclusion: ILDE通过理论证明为一种不确定性正则化的策略优化方法，具有乐观探索特性，后悔增长次线性。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算需求和部署成本不断增加，现有SVD压缩方法忽视了对矩阵关键组件的保护，导致压缩模型性能下降。

Method: 提出双级重要性保护机制：局部保护通过通道加权数据白化保留关键奇异向量；全局保护通过启发式或优化方法让次要层承担更多压缩负担。

Result: 实验表明，DipSVD在多个基准测试中优于现有SVD压缩方法，尤其在高压缩比下表现更优。

Conclusion: DipSVD通过保护关键组件显著提升了SVD压缩的性能，为LLMs的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted

scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data

automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Result: 实验显示，使用AMDA增强数据的NILM模型在复杂工业设备能耗分解中表现优异，归一化分解误差为0.093，优于未增强（0.451）和随机增强（0.290）的模型。

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段、物理引导的深度学习管道，用于放射治疗计划，通过结合MLC和MU值的直接监督以及预测的3D剂量分布，生成与临床结果高度匹配的治疗计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射治疗需要频繁调整治疗计划以适应解剖变化，传统方法效率低，深度学习可自动化此过程。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习管道，第一阶段监督学习MLC和MU值，第二阶段结合预测的3D剂量分布进行物理引导训练。

Result: 在133名前列腺癌患者数据上，该方法生成的计划与临床结果高度匹配，D95%和V95%差异小，同时减少对危险器官的辐射。

Conclusion: 物理引导的深度学习在放射治疗计划中具有潜力，能高效生成高质量治疗计划。

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose
conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and
monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires
frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,
necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising
solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,
physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first
stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan
parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we
incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose
distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We
train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a
uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target
volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented
using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment
plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean
difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV
while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at
risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in
RT planning.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于声学分析和机器学习的低成本枪声检测与枪支分类方法，利用手机等设备采集数据，深度学习模型表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 枪击事件频发威胁公共安全，现有商业系统成本高昂，需低成本替代方案。

Method: 通过分析枪声的声学特征（如枪口爆炸和冲击波），使用SVM和CNN进行检测与分类。

Result: CNN模型在干净数据上mAP为0.58，优于SVM的0.39；但在噪声数据上表现下降（mAP 0.35）。

Conclusion: 研究为低成本实时枪声检测系统提供了可能，需进一步解决数据质量和噪声问题。

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.

*Taous Iatariene,Can Cui,Alexandre Guérin,Romain Serizel*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法，以解决间歇性和移动说话人场景中的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人跟踪方法依赖空间观测，但在说话人间歇移动时会导致轨迹不连续，因此需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 利用初始跟踪步骤提供的轨迹信息和多通道音频信号，通过波束成形增强信号并提取说话人嵌入，最后基于注册池重新分配身份。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在说话人移动场景中显著提升了身份分配的准确性，并研究了波束成形和输入时长对嵌入提取的影响。

Conclusion: 基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法有效解决了间歇性和移动说话人跟踪问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Motivation: 解决自然语音中情感识别的复杂性，包括主体内和主体间的变异性，以及标注不一致的问题。

Method: 提出MATER框架，整合声学和文本特征，采用多层次（词、话语、嵌入）表示，并结合不确定性感知集成策略。

Result: 在SERNC挑战中排名第四，Macro-F1为41.01%，平均CCC为0.5928，在效价预测中排名第二，CCC为0.6941。

Conclusion: MATER框架有效捕捉了语音中的细微情感变化和语义信息，提升了情感识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in
Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion
recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of
natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose
Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel
hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the
word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic
cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures
both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we
introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator
inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER
ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of
0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of
0.6941.

TL;DR: Orbformer是一种可转移的波函数模型，通过预训练解决量子化学中键断裂的多参考性问题，并在多个分子上实现化学精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子化学中键断裂的多参考性描述是一个主要挑战，传统方法计算成本高且无法利用分子间电子结构的共性。

Method: 提出Orbformer，一种基于深度神经网络的量子蒙特卡罗方法，预训练了22,000个平衡和断裂结构，可微调用于新分子。

Result: Orbformer在键断裂和Diels-Alder反应中唯一一致达到化学精度（1 kcal/mol），成本效益比优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Orbformer将解决薛定谔方程的成本分摊到多个分子，为量子化学提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum
chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in
dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large
computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for
each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure
across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC)
uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable
wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here,
we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable
wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures
that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio
rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well
as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is
the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).
This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger
equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.

Method: 提出了X-SiT，一种可解释的神经网络，结合原型表面块解码器进行分类，并引入基于案例的推理。

Conclusion: X-SiT不仅性能优越，还能提供人类可理解的预测，有助于临床决策。

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

Motivation: 现有文本到3D场景生成方法通常仅面向正面、缺乏视觉保真度、场景理解有限，且仅适用于室内或室外环境。

Method: 系统通过合成360度全景图像，分解为背景和对象，通过混合修复构建完整3D表示，并将对象掩码提升为详细3D对象。

Conclusion: DreamAnywhere在多样化和挑战性场景中表现出色，适用于低预算电影制作和快速原型设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant
potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although
the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the
challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments
that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene
understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor
settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a
modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system
synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into
background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid
inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in
the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and
intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual
mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These
features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,
enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead
of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it
allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current
state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,
DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view
synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its
effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user
study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,
validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.

TL;DR: EditP23是一种无需掩码的3D编辑方法，通过将2D图像编辑传播到多视角表示中，实现3D一致的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖文本提示或显式空间掩码，而EditP23通过基于图像对的编辑提示，提供更直观的编辑方式。

Method: 利用预训练的多视角扩散模型，通过编辑感知流在潜在空间中传播编辑，无需优化，保持原始对象的结构和外观。

Result: 在多种对象类别和编辑场景中表现出色，保持高保真度且无需手动掩码。

Conclusion: EditP23提供了一种高效、直观的3D编辑方法，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D
image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In
contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or
explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a
pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image
prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a
pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently
propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without
optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both
structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of
object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source
while requiring no manual masks.
