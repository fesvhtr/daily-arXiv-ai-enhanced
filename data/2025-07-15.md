### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIL的视角不变学习策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）中导航策略对相机视角变化的鲁棒性，并在V2-VLNCE场景中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有导航策略对相机视角变化敏感的问题，提升在视角变化环境下的导航性能。

Method: 采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并引入教师-学生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE场景中，性能提升8-15%，并在标准VLNCE设置下仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，能显著提升导航策略的鲁棒性且不影响标准视角性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于面部生物特征异常模式的深度学习检测技术，用于识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术容易被用于欺诈、诈骗和政治虚假信息，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 利用面部生物特征中的异常模式，开发了一种新型的机器学习检测技术。

Result: 在大规模深度伪造数据集上评估了该技术，并测试了其对视频篡改的鲁棒性和对未知生成器的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该技术能够有效检测深度伪造视频，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据和任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型（如CLIP）中的隐含偏差，通过生成场景描述和对比式去偏损失来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生偏斜预测，PRISM旨在无需预定义偏差类别或外部数据的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分为两阶段：1）使用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）通过对比式去偏损失学习投影，最小化虚假相关性并保持图像与文本嵌入的对齐。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种有效且无需外部数据的去偏方法，适用于视觉语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空和运动学信息的HMR-ViT方法，通过构建时空-运动学特征图像并使用Vision Transformer进行编码，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，未能结合两者，限制了性能提升。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用通道重排矩阵优化特征排列，通过Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合NeRF与MPM的新框架，通过视觉观测推断颗粒材料特性，摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接测量不可行的情况下，通过视觉观测逆向分析颗粒材料特性。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟初始化材料点位置，贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [Infinite Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09068)
*Dell Zhang,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Mengxi Jia,Changzhi Sun,Ruilong Ren,Jingren Liu,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出无限视频理解（Infinite Video Understanding）作为多媒体研究的新前沿，旨在解决长视频处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态扩展在视频理解方面取得进展，但处理超长视频时仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出将无限视频理解作为研究方向，涉及流式架构、持久内存机制、分层表示和事件中心推理等创新。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了未来研究方向和核心挑战。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是多媒体和AI研究的重要目标，需在多个技术领域取得突破。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [7] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，旨在提高多模态基础模型生成标签的质量，通过结合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，解决现有方法在数据质量评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估多模态基础模型生成的标签质量时，过于关注数据数量而忽视质量，且缺乏全面的验证手段。

Method: VISTA框架整合了多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，用于识别和纠正标签中的隐藏问题。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割领域的两个基准数据集上，VISTA从定量和定性角度证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA通过提升数据质量，显著增强了多模态模型在复杂任务中的性能。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09256)
*Junyu Chen,Yihua Gao,Mingyuan Ge,Mingyong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAHR框架通过动态聚类原型对比学习解决图像-文本匹配中的语义模糊和高阶关联问题，显著提升匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理相似实例的高阶关联和语义模糊时存在不足，尤其是软正负样本问题。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局和局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互及动量对比学习。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AAHR有效解决了语义模糊问题，提升了图像-文本匹配的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

### [10] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，用于解决类别不平衡数据中尾部类别图像合成多样性不足的问题，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成多样性不足，需要在不影响头部类别的情况下提升尾部类别的多样性。

Method: 引入两种对比损失函数：无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比条件生成和无条件生成增强尾部类别多样性。

Result: 方法在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，首次将条件-无条件对齐应用于扩散模型，显著提升了类别不平衡数据的图像合成多样性。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CrisisLandMark数据集和CLOSP框架，通过文本对齐光学与SAR图像，提升检索性能54%，并整合地理坐标实现通用与专用任务的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能充分利用多传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的独特物理信息，限制了遥感档案的潜力。

Method: 引入CrisisLandMark数据集（64.7万张图像与结构化文本注释），提出CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像，并扩展为GeoCLOSP整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP在检索性能上提升54%，GeoCLOSP在位置依赖任务中表现更优，验证了多传感器与地理上下文整合的重要性。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理上下文的结合对释放遥感档案潜力至关重要，CLOSP和GeoCLOSP为通用与专用任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

### [12] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BlindSight方法，通过利用注意力稀疏性优化视觉语言模型（VLM）推理，减少计算量（FLOPs）同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度和注意力计算的二次复杂度，导致预填充时间延长，需解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 分析VLM中的注意力模式，发现稀疏性，提出基于输入模板的注意力稀疏掩码BlindSight，无需训练即可优化推理。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上测试，BlindSight平均减少32%-41% FLOPs，准确性变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight有效减少计算开销，适用于多图像理解任务，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

### [13] [RAPNet: A Receptive-Field Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10461)
*Tao Tang,Chengxu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的遥感图像融合方法，显著提升了空间细节提取的精度和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv)和Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF)模块，实现空间自适应卷积和特征融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应组件有效解决了遥感图像融合中的局部内容变化问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需微调的方法，通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型来提取光流，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型（仅用于未来帧预测）来提取光流，而无需微调，以解决标签稀缺和合成数据与真实数据差距的问题。

Method: 基于Counterfactual World Model范式，通过注入小扰动并跟踪其传播来提取光流，提出KL-tracing方法，利用LRAS架构的特性。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上分别实现了16.6%和4.7%的相对改进，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过可控生成视频模型的因果提示是一种可扩展且有效的高质量光流提取方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器视觉在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用，理解卷积神经网络的内部机制及其推理原因变得重要。

Method: MI CAM通过互信息加权特征图，线性组合权重和激活图生成显著性可视化，并通过反事实分析验证因果解释。

Result: MI CAM在定性和定量指标上优于部分现有方法，与最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: MI CAM提供了无偏的模型推理可视化解释，性能优越。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo通过整合放射科医生的眼动视频序列，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在胸部X光分析和疾病诊断中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的顺序信息，而RadEyeVideo旨在捕捉眼动的时空动态，以提升模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频序列输入LVLM，用于胸部X光报告生成和疾病诊断。

Result: 模型性能提升高达24.6%（报告生成）和平均15.2%（两项任务），甚至超越专业医学LVLM。

Conclusion: RadEyeVideo展示了专家知识（眼动信息）与LVLM结合的巨大潜力，为医疗图像分析提供了可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

TL;DR: PointSD利用Stable Diffusion（SD）模型增强3D点云自监督学习，通过点云引导去噪图像并提取SD特征，提升3D表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型受限于小规模数据集，而SD模型在大规模数据上表现优异，因此探索如何利用SD提升3D自监督学习。

Method: 提出PointSD框架，将SD模型的文本编码器替换为3D编码器，训练点云到图像的扩散模型，并提取SD特征对齐3D主干网络。

Result: 实验表明，PointSD在下游点云任务中显著提升了自监督学习效果。

Conclusion: SD模型可以有效增强3D点云自监督学习，PointSD为这一方向提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），解决了传统方法的误差累积和实时性问题。通过多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制，提升了生成质量和实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段无法避免误差累积，而扩散模型虽然生成质量高，但迭代特性限制了实时应用。因此，需要一种结合两者优势的方法来解决SLP中的问题。

Method: 采用混合自回归和扩散模型的方法，设计多尺度姿态表示模块提取细节特征，并引入置信感知因果注意力机制动态指导姿态生成。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成质量和实时流效率上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了自回归和扩散模型的优势，显著提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Conclusion: RoHOI基准和SAMPL策略显著提升了HOI检测的鲁棒性，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了CLIP模型中模态间隙的关键作用，而论文发现模态间隙能反映预训练知识的保留程度，因此提出利用这一特性改进持续学习。

Method: 提出MG-CLIP方法，通过保留模态间隙以减少遗忘，并通过补偿模态间隙增强新数据学习能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MG-CLIP表现优于现有方法，且无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙为持续学习提供了新视角，MG-CLIP方法简单有效，显著提升了CLIP在持续学习中的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++为文本到运动生成提供了更高质量的数据集和模型，支持长期运动生成和细粒度控制。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉语言连接器提升定位精度，优于现有方法LocLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；LocLLM虽通过语言引导实现零样本泛化，但其线性投影器无法捕捉复杂的空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM用非线性MLP（两层+GELU激活）替换线性投影器，实现跨模态特征分层融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），并在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的最新进展。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$I^{2}$-World的高效4D占用预测框架，通过解耦场景标记化实现3D场景的动态表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中复杂3D场景的高效标记化问题，以应对极端情况。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合多尺度残差量化和残差聚合策略，并使用编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在4D占用预测任务中，mIoU和IoU分别提升25.1%和36.9%，计算效率高（2.9 GB内存，37.0 FPS）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于自动驾驶场景的动态预测。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度方面存在不足，主要依赖复杂的辅助结构，导致优化信号冲突和局部编辑受限。

Method: SSD利用Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入恒定项null-text分支以稳定优化过程，同时加入提示增强分支提升编辑强度。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务中达到最先进效果，包括NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD为文本引导编辑提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了编辑的稳定性和对齐性。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示解决了token维度饱和问题，有效平衡了基础知识的保留和新任务的学习。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models

contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为THYME的时空层次循环场景图方法，用于解决动态场景理解中的碎片化表示问题，并引入了一个新的数据集AeroEye-v1.0。实验表明THYME在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景理解在自动驾驶、监控和体育分析等领域需求迫切，但现有方法难以同时捕捉细粒度空间细节和长程时间依赖关系。

Method: THYME方法结合了层次特征聚合和循环时间细化，以建模多尺度空间上下文并确保时间一致性。

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上的实验表明，THYME方法优于现有技术，提升了场景理解的准确性。

Conclusion: THYME通过整合时空信息，显著改进了动态场景图生成，为复杂场景理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: Wave propagation on the surface of a material contains information about
physical properties beneath its surface. We propose a method for inferring the
thickness and stiffness of a structure from just a video of waves on its
surface. Our method works by extracting a dispersion relation from the video
and then solving a physics-based optimization problem to find the best-fitting
thickness and stiffness parameters. We validate our method on both simulated

measurements. Our technique provides a proof-of-concept for at-home health
monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further
applicable to fields such as human-computer interaction.

Result: 在三个医学视觉问答基准测试中，Expert-CFG以4.2B参数优于13B参数的现有最优模型。

Conclusion: Expert-CFG展示了在资源有限环境中临床应用的可行性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

Result: 算法在合成数据集上验证了性能，KITTI-AR数据集扩展了KITTI，新增6k对立体图像。

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集有效提升了3D异常检测的泛化能力，适用于零样本场景。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be
obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

Conclusion: 球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像任务中预训练模型的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中需要在线预测点跟踪，但现有方法多为离线处理，依赖未来帧信息。论文旨在开发一种无需未来信息的在线长期点跟踪方法。

Method: 结合视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，提出Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点作为查询，逐帧处理视频。

Result: Track-On在七个公开基准测试中达到最新技术水平，证明了无需未来信息的长期点跟踪的可行性。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可作为有用初始化，但需专门设计（如Track-On）以实现在线长期点跟踪，为动态环境建模提供新方法。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现出色，但面临训练与测试数据分布偏移和置信度不对齐的挑战，导致过度自信的错误预测。

Method: StaRFM引入FIP减少嵌入中的协变量偏移，并通过CMP校准分割任务中的不确定性。FIP通过Fisher-Rao范数控制泛化，CMP通过Brier分数优化最小化校准误差。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集上，StaRFM提升3.5%准确率并降低28% ECE；在医学分割任务中达到84.7% DSC和4.8mm HD95；跨域性能差距降低40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的框架，无需大幅修改架构即可与基础模型集成，显著提升了性能与校准能力。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自我中心视角重建人体外观的挑战，如遮挡和身体比例失真，并减少对多视角数据集的依赖。

Method: 使用ControlNet和Stable Diffusion框架，从遮挡的俯视图像生成逼真的正面视图，再通过图像到运动模型生成虚拟形象动作。

Result: 首次实现了从自我中心输入重建可动画虚拟形象的生成方法，提高了系统的可访问性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为更通用和便捷的远程呈现系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过因果去偏显著提升了复杂场景下的情感识别鲁棒性。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中性能超越现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 提出的标记化和对齐策略有效提升了无注释手语翻译的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Conclusion: CKD方法有效解决了跨模态和跨架构挑战，显著提升了SNN性能。

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust通过自动化提示工程提升了多模态大语言模型在安全关键领域的可信度，具有潜在的可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Result: 在挑战性基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且无需额外先验即可处理非均匀运动模糊。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著降低了对初始核的敏感性，提升了BMD的整体性能，并具有即插即用的灵活性。

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 深度信息的引入显著提升了手术阶段识别的性能，Geo-RepNet为复杂手术场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Motivation: Vision Transformers（ViTs）在少样本图像分类中的潜力尚未充分挖掘，本文旨在利用ViT提升原型网络的性能。

Method: 将ViT-Small作为主干网络集成到原型网络中，通过平均支持样本的类别条件嵌入构建鲁棒原型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ViT-ProtoNet在5-shot设置下表现优于CNN原型网络，准确率提升3.2%，且特征可分性更强。

Conclusion: ViT-ProtoNet是一种高效、灵活的少样本分类方法，为基于Transformer的元学习设定了新基准。

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAA*的新方法，通过引入路径角度自由度（PAF）改进A*算法，提升路径平滑性和相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路径平滑性在专家演示的路径模仿学习中常被忽视，本文旨在通过自适应路径平滑性提高路径相似性。

Method: 结合PAF的DAA*方法，通过优化路径缩短和平滑性（分别对应启发式距离和PAF）来提升路径最优性。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，DAA*在路径相似性和长度上显著优于现有方法，如神经A*和TransPath。

Conclusion: DAA*在路径最优性和搜索效率之间取得了平衡，显著提升了路径模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ALPHA基准和ALPHAVAE模型，用于RGBA图像生成，显著提升了透明内容的重建和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在RGB图像合成上表现优异，但透明或分层内容（RGBA图像）的生成因缺乏大规模基准而未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了ALPHA基准，将标准RGB指标扩展到四通道图像；开发了ALPHAVAE模型，通过扩展预训练RGB VAE并引入专用alpha通道，结合多种目标进行训练。

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅使用8K图像训练的情况下，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提升3.2%，并在透明图像生成中表现优越。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE为RGBA图像生成提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on
https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

Motivation: 随着多模态对话系统研究的深入，用户期望系统更具主动性，例如在视频播放中实时决定多轮响应时机。

Method: 提出ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，评估系统在主动交互中的表现，并通过用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: PAUC与传统指标相比更符合人类偏好，能更准确地反映主动交互场景中的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态对话系统的发展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练范式仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失，并结合音频、视频及其融合的框架；采用聚类引导的自监督预训练策略解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的Top-1准确率，并通过消融实验验证了各模块的必要性。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过细粒度对齐和动态混淆损失显著提升了模型性能，为音频-视频任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

<details>

Motivation: 3D MLLMs在场景理解方面表现出色，但计算效率低下限制了实际部署。现有2D视觉令牌剪枝方法在3D领域适用性不足。

Method: 提出Fast3D框架，包含全局注意力预测（GAP）和样本自适应剪枝（SAP）两项创新技术，无需修改目标模型参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了Fast3D的有效性，尤其是在高剪枝率下表现突出。

Conclusion: Fast3D为3D MLLMs提供了一种高效且通用的视觉令牌剪枝解决方案，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Result: 在三个多光谱点云数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了室外多光谱点云分类性能。

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探讨复杂架构是否必要，发现预训练基础模型能简化架构并提升性能。

Method: 使用简单的编码器架构（Video ViTs），研究不同预训练方法（弱监督、全监督、自监督MVM及领域自适应DAPT）的效果。

Result: 自监督MVM和DAPT表现最佳，简单模型在性能与效率上均优于复杂方法。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单高效的TAD模型可行，无需复杂架构。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

*Zhihan Kang,Boyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CKAA框架通过双级知识对齐和任务置信度引导的适配器混合，提升持续学习模型对误导任务ID的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数高效微调（PEFT）方法中因独立训练子模块导致特征子空间不对齐的问题，从而减少误导任务ID下的模糊决策。

Method: 提出双级知识对齐（DKA）和任务置信度引导的适配器混合（TC-MoA）方法，分别用于训练和推理阶段。

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有PEFT-based CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过特征对齐和自适应知识聚合，显著提升了模型对误导任务ID的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMID-Net提出了一种在双曲空间中结合掩码图像建模（MIM）和知识蒸馏的高效方法，显著提升了视觉-语义层次结构的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和语义概念通常以层次结构组织，现有方法如MERU在双曲空间中表现良好，但训练效率仍有提升空间。

Method: HMID-Net在双曲空间中整合MIM和知识蒸馏技术，并设计了专门的双曲空间蒸馏损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP等现有模型。

Conclusion: HMID-Net证明了双曲空间中MIM和知识蒸馏的高效性，为视觉-语义层次学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频理解基准，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正进行视频级推理，而非仅依赖关键帧或文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准多依赖静态图像分析，无法评估LVLMs是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，覆盖11类任务，需全程观看视频并推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，而最佳LVLM（GPT-o3）仅66.43%，显示模型仍难以超越表面推理。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在视频级推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合张量分解和正则化的自适应性网络（SDTN）及轻量级网络（TRN），用于高光谱图像分类，显著提升精度并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标记样本稀缺的情况下表现不佳，需要更高效的方法。

Method: SDTN通过动态调整张量秩优化特征表示，TRN则利用SDTN提取的特征构建轻量级网络，捕获多尺度光谱-空间特征。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上，该方法在分类精度和模型参数减少方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN的组合为高光谱图像分类提供了一种高效、实时的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决缓存方法在分布偏移下的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据的分布偏移任务中性能下降，需要测试时适应（TTA）方法提升性能。缓存方法虽有效，但面临熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活的问题。

Method: 提出ReTA方法，结合CER（利用一致性约束加权熵）和DDC（将类文本嵌入建模为高斯分布以调整决策边界）。

Result: 实验表明ReTA在真实分布偏移场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过增强缓存质量和决策边界灵活性，显著提升了VLMs在分布偏移任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Result: F1分数达到38.03，比之前的最佳方法提升了37.9%，在比赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势识别任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除空间冗余激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等基于状态空间模型（SSM）的视觉骨干网络中空间冗余问题，提升效率而不需重新训练。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，在扫描前剪枝冗余空间激活，并通过最近邻上采样恢复维度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%的速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上同样有效。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的部署效率工具，适用于SSM模型，无需牺牲迁移能力。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，利用最优传输理论直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，并通过细节保留正则化和提示学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 采用Schrödinger Bridge框架，结合最优传输理论和细节保留正则化，并引入提示学习利用CLIP模型。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉标记化方法存在计算冗余和内存效率低的问题。

Method: 采用内容感知的标记化策略，根据文档复杂度生成标记，并结合三阶段训练范式。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，图像标记数量减少3.6倍，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线5.5点。

Conclusion: 内容感知标记化与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态机制和稀疏性先验的结合，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Result: 实验表明，DeRefNet在SeqCSIST数据集上优于现有方法，mAP提升5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST Unmixing任务，为相关研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段架构和局部提取策略，显著提升了手部姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术字体设计依赖手工，而现有生成模型缺乏交互性和灵活性。

Result: 系统支持高质量、多语言的艺术字体生成，提升交互性和创作可能性。

Conclusion: WordCraft为设计师提供了更灵活、高效的创作工具。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a

TL;DR: MENTOR提出了一种新的自回归框架，通过两阶段训练实现多模态输入与图像输出的细粒度对齐，提升了生成控制性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像模型在多模态输入平衡、精确视觉控制和复杂多模态图像生成训练需求方面的局限性。

Method: 结合自回归图像生成器和两阶段训练范式：多模态对齐阶段和指令调优阶段，无需额外适配器或跨注意力模块。

Result: 在DreamBench++基准测试中表现优异，优于基线方法，同时具有更高的图像重建保真度和训练效率。

Conclusion: MENTOR为多模态图像生成提供了一种高效可控的解决方案，具有广泛的任务适应性和资源效率。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

TL;DR: MA-SAM2是一种无需训练的视频对象分割策略，针对手术视频中的复杂性和遮挡问题进行了优化，性能优于SAM2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分割对提升手术质量和患者结果至关重要，但现有SAM2框架在复杂手术视频中表现不佳。

Method: 提出MA-SAM2，采用上下文感知和抗遮挡记忆模型，无需额外训练。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别提升4.36%和6.1%。

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在复杂手术视频中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

TL;DR: Inter2Former通过优化密集令牌处理的计算分配，提出四种关键改进，实现了在CPU设备上高效且高精度的交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式分割方法在密集令牌处理上存在速度与精度的权衡，Inter2Former旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出动态提示嵌入（DPE）、动态混合注意力（DHA）、混合专家（HMoE）和动态局部上采样（DLU）四种改进。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中，Inter2Former实现了最优性能，并在CPU设备上高效运行。

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过自适应计算策略，成功平衡了交互式分割的速度与精度。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

Motivation: 现有无监督适应方法无法捕捉细粒度类别差异或计算成本高，需改进。

Method: 提出FAIR方法，利用Class Description Anchors动态对齐特征，定义Learned Alignment Score，并引入自训练加权机制。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，FAIR比现有方法整体性能提升2.78%。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态跨模态交互和伪标签优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: GAA是一个基于区域引导的少样本异常图像-掩码对生成框架，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成真实、多样且语义对齐的异常样本，解决了现有方法在异常合成中的低真实性、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常样本稀缺限制了现有方法在定位和分类任务中的效果，现有异常合成方法存在低真实性、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GAA通过局部概念分解联合建模异常的语义特征和空间信息，利用自适应多轮异常聚类增强异常表示一致性，采用区域引导掩码生成策略确保异常与掩码对齐，并引入低质量样本过滤模块提升生成样本质量。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA通过区域引导和少样本生成框架，显著提升了异常合成的真实性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Conclusion: 去偏技术在医学影像AI中效果复杂，需重视公平性以确保医疗解决方案的公正可靠。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性建模显著提升了眼部分割和注视估计的鲁棒性，适用于AR/VR交互。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately

To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D

demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such

recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD是一种高效且稳定的改进方法，显著提升了文本到3D生成的质量和性能。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

*Ofir Itzhak Shahar,Gur Elkin,Ohad Ben-Shahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的混合（几何和图像）方法，用于计算碎片对的最佳对齐，无需假设其形状、尺寸或图像内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理现实拼图中碎片的几何特性，或依赖碎片形状的限制。

Method: 结合几何和图像信息计算碎片对的最优对齐，并引入新的图像碎片数据集和侵蚀模型。

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 提出的兼容性方法显著提升了拼图重建性能。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

*Amirhossein Ansari,Ke Wang,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegRefine提出了一种改进的负标签细化框架，用于零样本OOD检测，通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，提高了检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判问题，主要由于负标签可能包含子类别或专有名词，且难以处理多标签匹配的情况。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除负标签集中的子类别和专有名词，并采用多匹配感知评分函数动态调整多标签匹配的贡献。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现优于现有方法，实现了更准确的OOD检测。

Conclusion: NegRefine通过负标签细化和多匹配感知评分，显著提升了零样本OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRU-Accident是一个大规模视觉语言基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在高风险交通场景中对弱势道路用户（VRUs）的理解和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基准来定量评估MLLMs在涉及VRUs的复杂、安全关键场景中的推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含1K真实事故视频、6K多选题对和1K密集场景描述的VRU-Accident基准，并对17种先进MLLMs进行了评估。

Result: MLLMs在视觉基础属性上表现良好，但在推理事故原因、类型和可预防性方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估MLLMs在VRU安全场景中的空白，揭示了其推理能力的不足。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了人类和深度学习模型在识别稀疏3D形状（如点云）时的表现差异，发现视觉变换器模型更接近人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型是否形成与人类相似的3D形状表征，以及其局限性。

Method: 通过实验系统操纵点密度、对象方向和局部几何结构，比较人类与两种深度学习模型（DGCNN和点变换器）的表现。

Result: 点变换器模型在模拟人类表现上优于卷积模型，因其支持3D形状的层次抽象。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型更接近人类的3D形状表征机制，为模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频推理方法主要依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉模态，而人类推理时会重新审视视觉内容。

Method: 构建了ViTIB基准，采用ViTCoT范式，结合视觉和文本信息进行推理。

Result: ViTCoT显著优于传统文本CoT范式，并激活了更多MLLM神经元。

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频理解领域提供了更直观且认知对齐的推理方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1)
methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2)
training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response
tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets
utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning.
Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and
propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant
breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer
high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to
focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual
human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M
dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉与语言模型（VLMs）在跨模态信息整合上未能一致表现人类认知中的bouba-kiki效应，与人类行为存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用CLIP的ResNet和ViT变体，结合提示评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析。

Result: 模型未一致表现bouba-kiki效应，且与人类数据相比表现显著不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限，与人类认知不完全一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了4D人体解析的效率与灵活性，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、邻近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果引导显著提升反事实解释的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽略了从低维到高维转换的固有挑战，MCGA旨在通过分阶段学习解决这一问题。

Method: MCGA采用两阶段方法：1) 多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式，提取混合码本；2) 通过查询码本特征优化RGB到HSI映射，并引入灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力。

Result: 实验表明MCGA在性能上达到最优，代码和模型已开源。

Conclusion: MCGA通过分阶段学习和注意力机制，高效解决了RGB到HSI的高维转换问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变对航空图像检测器性能有显著提升，MessDet在低参数量下表现优异。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖的多模态AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Result: 实验结果表明，IGD在复杂图形设计任务中具有可扩展性和扩展性。

Conclusion: IGD为图形设计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search

of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Crucial-Diff框架，通过生成关键样本解决数据稀缺问题，提升检测和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成方法生成的样本重复或简单，无法针对下游模型的弱点提供关键信息。

Method: 提出Crucial-Diff框架，包含SAFE（统一特征提取器）和WASM（基于下游模型反馈生成难检测样本）两个模块。

Result: 在MVTec上达到83.63%的像素级AP和78.12%的F1-MAX；在息肉数据集上达到81.64%的mIoU和87.69%的mDice。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff能生成多样且高质量的样本，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在细粒度时尚属性识别中的潜力，以提升电商产品目录的组织和客户发现体验。

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，仅以图像为输入，评估模型在18个时尚属性类别中的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.0 Flash更适合电商产品属性识别任务，但需进一步领域微调。研究为时尚AI和多模态属性提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多图像超分辨率（MISR）和卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法，通过融合多幅低分辨率图像实现原子级超分辨率，解决了电子显微镜在光束敏感材料中的辐射损伤问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜在光束敏感材料（如蛋白质和二维材料）中的应用受到辐射损伤的严重限制，需要一种新方法来突破传统电子显微镜的电子剂量限制。

Method: 结合多图像超分辨率（MISR）和卷积神经网络（CNN），开发了一种双路径注意力引导网络，用于4D-STEM，从超低剂量数据中实现原子级超分辨率。

Result: 在超低剂量条件下，该方法的空间分辨率与传统ptychography相当，适用于非晶、半晶和晶态光束敏感样品。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用性强的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖KL散度估计不确定性，忽略了模态间的领域差距，KPHD-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: KPHD-Net使用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Kalman滤波器，优化不确定性估计和多视图融合。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过Hölder散度和Dempster-Shafer理论，显著提升了多视图学习的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: VMAEs和LDMAEs为潜在扩散模型中的自编码器设计提供了新的方向，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现优异，但在具身环境中（如在线交互和主动场景理解）表现不足，亟需解决。

Method: 提出EmRACE-3K数据集，包含3000多个语言指导任务，并通过微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型（监督学习+强化学习）来提升性能。

Result: 在零样本设置下，所有模型成功率低于20%；微调后模型在所有挑战类别中均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K数据集为具身推理能力的评估和开发提供了有效工具，展示了微调方法的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 3DGAA是一种实用的攻击框架，可用于评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in

research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种图像序列二项自补偿（I-BSC）方法，用于解决动态测量中相位偏移轮廓术（PSP）的运动误差问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSP在动态测量中因物体运动而产生误差，现有方法（如P-BSC）计算复杂且误差累积严重。

Method: I-BSC通过对同质条纹图像加权求和，仅需一次反正切计算，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现了准单帧速率，计算帧速率提升数倍至数十倍，且误差收敛更快。

Conclusion: I-BSC是一种高效且低计算复杂度的动态测量解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Motivation: 现有方法在大规模数据集上训练连接器模块时计算成本高，且单模态模型选择复杂。

Result: Hyma将最优单模态模型对的搜索成本降低了10倍，同时性能与网格搜索相当。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型对齐解决方案，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Result: 在公开和自收集数据集上，mIR@1提升6.50%，mR@1提升7.96%，F减少8.95%。

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoSMo, a novel multimodal Transformer for Page Stream
Segmentation (PSS) in comic books, a critical task for automated content
understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging
ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for
scalable comic book analysis.

Motivation: 家禽养殖易受传染病影响，需低成本、高效的疾病检测方法。

Method: 采用多颜色空间特征提取（RGB、HSV、LAB）和多种描述符（颜色直方图、LBP、小波变换等），结合PCA和XGBoost降维，训练ANN分类器。

Result: 模型准确率95.85%，无需GPU，执行时间638秒，资源消耗远低于深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源农业环境提供了一种高效、可解释的疾病检测替代方案。

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Result: 在多个任务中验证了其有效性和效率，性能竞争性强且速度显著提升。

Conclusion: MoVieS成功实现了动态场景的统一建模，支持零样本应用，并在速度和性能上表现优异。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成能力上表现出色，但受曝光偏差影响较大。论文通过观察能量变化规律，旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 提出的方法无需训练且即插即用，显著提升了多种扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 频率域调节机制为不同架构的扩散模型提供了解决曝光偏差的稳健方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SegFormer模型的两阶段迁移学习策略，用于解决遥感图像水体分割中的领域偏移和小样本问题，显著提高了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像水体分割中因领域差异和小样本导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 采用两阶段迁移学习策略：先在多样化的源域上训练基础分割模型，再在目标域数据上进行微调。

Result: 在西藏札达土林区域的实验中，IoU从直接迁移的25.50%提升至64.84%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了领域差异导致的性能下降问题，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取的技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Method: 提出了FIX-CLIP，包括双分支训练、区域提示和层次特征对齐模块，并利用合成数据训练。

Result: FIX-CLIP在长短文本检索任务中表现最佳，且其文本编码器在扩散模型中表现优异。

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效解决了CLIP的长文本输入问题，并在多个任务中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Motivation: 解决多相机环境下目标跟踪的全局身份一致性问题。

Method: 采用BoT-SORT单相机跟踪，通过轨迹特征匹配初始化全局ID，后续帧使用优先全局匹配策略。

Result: 实现了跨视图的全局身份一致性跟踪。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多相机多目标跟踪中的身份一致性问题。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督全景分割方法DEARLi，通过结合两个基础模型（CLIP和SAM）提升识别和定位能力，在标签稀缺场景下表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 解决像素级标注成本高的问题，同时利用基础模型提升半监督分割的性能。

Method: 结合无监督掩码变换器一致性和CLIP的零样本分类增强识别，利用SAM伪标签进行类无关解码器预热以提升定位。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上仅用158张标注图像达到29.9 PQ和38.9 mIoU，性能显著优于现有方法且GPU内存需求更低。

Conclusion: DEARLi在标签稀缺和大分类任务中表现出色，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Method: 通过分析心脏运动偏差，改进了训练策略并引入定制化增强方法，同时提出了一种基于多尺度成本体积的轻量级网络。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的方法显著提升了性能，如EchoTracker在位置准确性和轨迹误差上分别提升了60.7%和61.5%。

Conclusion: 尽管某些点跟踪模型表现不佳，但改进方法在临床评估中表现出更好的可重复性，与专家验证工具更接近。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 反馈机制提升了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更适应性和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 双级别域适应方法有效提升了文本人物检索的性能，解决了合成与真实数据间的域差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像上的细粒度定位和推理能力不足，主要由于固定分辨率的预训练图像编码器导致训练与测试分辨率不一致。

Method: 提出ECP框架：第一阶段从降采样图像中提取候选区域，第二阶段基于候选区域进行最终预测，保留细粒度细节。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上，分别比基线提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效解决了高分辨率图像处理中的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，独立于多模态模型结构和融合方法，是一种高效的多模态学习优化策略。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: DGL通过解耦优化过程，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

*Jeongho Kim,Sunghyun Park,Hyoungwoo Park,Sungrack Yun,Jaegul Choo,Seokeon Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA的新方法，通过训练LoRA层实现高效个性化人体图像生成，无需推理时微调，显著提升了生成图像的保真度和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人体图像生成面临计算成本高和实时性不足的问题，现有方法需要推理时微调或大规模数据集训练。

Method: 采用LoRA层训练，结合衣柜条件和空间参考减少信息损失，引入选择性主题区域损失优化生成效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，支持少量样本训练和单模型推理。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA为高效、高质量的个性化人体图像生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

TL;DR: VRFNO通过噪声优化改进Reflow，提升单步和少步图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflow在训练中通过确定性耦合改善图像生成轨迹，但存在分布差距问题，影响生成速度和质量。

Method: 提出VRFNO框架，结合编码器和神经速度场，引入历史速度项和噪声优化，优化耦合。

Result: 实验显示VRFNO显著提升生成性能，在单步和少步任务中达到最优。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决Reflow的局限性，提升图像生成质量。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spatial Lifting（SL）的新方法，通过将输入数据（如2D图像）提升到更高维度（如3D），并使用高维网络处理，显著减少了模型参数和推理成本，同时在密集预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法通常需要大量参数和计算资源，SL旨在通过维度提升实现高效且高性能的解决方案。

Method: SL将输入数据（如2D图像）提升到更高维度（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集（13个语义分割和6个深度估计）上验证，模型参数减少98%以上，推理成本降低，性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Method: 提出ProGait数据集，包含412个视频片段，支持多种视觉任务，并提供了基准模型。

Result: 基线模型在假肢特定任务上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProGait数据集为假肢步态分析提供了实用工具，并展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在边界OOD样本上的误分类问题，利用基础模型生成更具挑战性的OOD数据。

Method: 结合扩散模型和多模态大语言模型，通过迭代修复和能量分数梯度调整生成边界对齐的OOD样本，并微调CLIP模型。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界OOD数据有效增强模型区分能力，为OOD检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Motivation: 随着生成技术的快速发展，AI生成图像的逼真度已足以欺骗人类，如何维持社会信任和数字信息完整性成为关键挑战。

Result: 改进后的模型在真实场景下的AUC平均提升了26.87%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有AID模型在真实场景中的局限性，并通过优化关键因素显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Result: 风格迁移显著减少纹理偏差，提升对图像损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中具有普适性，能有效减少纹理偏差并增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在稀疏输入的物体中心场景中，背景纹理可能显著影响相机姿态估计的准确性，因此需要一种有效的攻击方法。

Method: 引入Kaleidoscopic Background Attack（KBA），利用多对称性的相同片段形成背景，并提出投影方向一致性损失优化这些片段。

Result: 实验表明，优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法在攻击相机姿态估计模型方面表现出色，为相关领域的安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，FTCFormer在图像分类任务中表现优于基线，提升幅度为1.43%（细粒度数据集）、1.09%（自然图像数据集）、0.97%（医学数据集）和0.55%（遥感数据集）。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的标记生成策略，显著提升了Transformer在视觉任务中的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化情况下难以保留细粒度的身份特征，导致修复结果缺乏个体特性。

Result: 实验表明，IP-FVR在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，修复质量和身份一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频修复中表现出强大的潜力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，DisCo显著优于现有方法，并提高了令牌效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLMs提供了一种高效且性能优越的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Conclusion: 双视觉编码器框架有效解决了无注释手语翻译问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像特征匹配中存在不对齐问题，主要源于单图像理解与跨图像理解需求之间的差异，导致在多实例匹配中表现不佳。

Method: 1) 使用生成式扩散模型替代对比学习基础模型，以捕捉实例级细节；2) 提出跨图像交互提示模块，通过生成模型的提示机制促进图像对间的双向信息交互。

Result: IMD在常用基准测试中达到新最优性能，并在多实例基准IMIM上提升了12%。

Conclusion: IMD有效解决了基础模型在特征匹配中的不对齐问题，显著提升了多实例场景下的匹配性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导有效提升了墙体分割性能。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机图模型的文本适配器（VRGAdapter），用于捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，并通过不确定性引导的多分支融合（UMF）提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性文本适配器无法充分捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，限制了视觉语言模型（VLM）在下游任务中的潜力。

Method: 提出VRGAdapter，利用顶点随机知识图（VRKG）建模类别描述的多样性和类间关系，并通过概率消息传播学习上下文感知的分布表示。引入UMF动态集成多个预训练模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，显著提升了VLM在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出并解决了细粒度零样本目标检测（FG-ZSD）问题，开发了基于改进两阶段检测器的MSHC方法，并构建了首个FG-ZSD基准数据集FGZSD-Birds。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象，而现实场景中常需区分细节差异小的细粒度对象（如不同鸟类、鱼类和花卉）。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: MSHC方法有效解决了细粒度零样本目标检测问题，为相关研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前方法依赖专用架构或预定义增强训练，限制了泛化能力，需要一种更通用的鲁棒视觉感知方法。

Method: FOCAL通过生成和优化候选变换，将其推向视觉上典型的“规范”视图，利用基础模型的先验知识。

Result: 实验显示FOCAL提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，提供了一种可扩展的鲁棒性实现路径。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将拓扑数据分析（TDA）特征与深度学习模型结合的方法，显著提升了遥感分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能有效描述复杂数据的几何信息，因此结合两者可以弥补CNN的局限性。

Method: 提出TDA特征工程流程，将拓扑特征与ResNet18模型结合，应用于遥感分类任务。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上，模型准确率达到99.33%，超过所有先前单模型结果；在RESISC45数据集上，准确率比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习模型有效结合，即使在没有显式拓扑结构的数据集上，扩展了TDA的应用范围。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SC-AGIQA优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点拟合参数模型，但关键点获取耗时且不可靠。

Method: 提出密集特征网络将2D表示映射到SMAL参数，并开发分层对齐策略整合多种视觉线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基线方法，生成的高质量3D资产可支持其他任务。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal具有大规模应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Result: 评估了多个先进LVLM，揭示了关键局限和机会，为未来LVLM发展提供了基础。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像的视觉语言推理提供了全面基准，支持珊瑚保护工作。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

Conclusion: RefSTAR方法有效解决了盲人脸图像修复中的身份保留问题，并提升了参考特征的利用效率。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间与位置预测，实现了高性能，同时支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，导航系统成功率95%，综合准确率达99.99%。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且泛化能力强，代码将公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估和改进方向。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Conclusion: PRoPE能有效利用相机几何信息，提升多视角Transformer的性能，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

TL;DR: 利用高分辨率地球观测数据和深度学习技术，首次为莫桑比克绘制了全国范围的农田分布图，覆盖2100万块农田，精度达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小农农业系统基础属性（如农田空间分布和地块大小）理解不足的问题，以支持科学政策的制定。

Method: 整合1.5米高分辨率地球观测数据和深度迁移学习，最小化参考数据需求并提升可迁移性。

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克2023年全国范围的农田分布图，精度高（93%），并揭示了农田碎片化和地块大小的多样性。

Conclusion: 地块大小是影响农业社会经济和环境结果的关键指标，研究结果为政策制定提供了重要依据。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

*Borui Zhang,Qihang Rao,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQ框架通过预训练的VAE快速训练VQ-VAE，显著降低计算成本，同时保持高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高压缩率VQ-VAE训练计算成本高，需数千GPU小时，亟需高效替代方案。

Method: 利用预训练VAE，通过控制量化噪声和引入通道多组量化与后矫正器，实现快速VQ-VAE训练。

Result: ReVQ在单块NVIDIA 4090上22小时完成训练，压缩ImageNet图像至512个token，重建质量优异（rFID=1.06）。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率与重建质量间取得优越平衡，计算成本降低两个数量级。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast
amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual
animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully
self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过去除推理过程中的冗余来提升大语言模型性能的方法，重点关注注意力分散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在长链推理中存在注意力分散和冗余问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过测量特殊标记的注意力分数识别冗余，并采用结构感知剪枝去除低贡献推理块。

Result: 方法显著提升了推理密集型任务的准确性，尤其在数学竞赛基准测试中表现突出。

Conclusion: 去除推理冗余能有效提升模型性能，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合两种虚拟差距分析（VGA）模型的新型多准则评估（MCA）方法，以提高评估的效率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多准则评估中因假设和主观判断导致的复杂性和不准确性，尤其是在处理定量和定性数据时。

Method: 结合两种基于线性规划的VGA模型，提出新的MCA方法。

Result: 通过两个数值示例验证了方法的准确性和透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化决策系统和支持系统提供了可靠且灵活的解决方案，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria
Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of
Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several
criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be
influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation
challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to
incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of
cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion
values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed,
significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine
the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines
two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear
programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves
efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and
dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive
numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed
method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress
in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足不同用例（模拟主义、戏剧主义和评估主义）的需求，需要一种灵活的场景定义框架，以支持快速迭代和模块化。

Method: 采用实体-组件架构模式，将游戏管理员（GM）设计为可配置的实体，由组件构成，实现工程师与设计师的分工协作。

Result: 通过Concordia库的实践，证明了该框架能够有效配置符合用户特定目标的场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分离关注点，实现了快速迭代、模块化和可扩展性，适用于多样化的生成式AI应用。

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging
from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation.
Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist,
Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition
framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from
tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible
for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly
determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the
Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM
is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed
of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a
separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an
engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and
configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the
components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid
iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We
describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this
philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure
scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Motivation: 生物多样性快速丧失对生态研究和保护策略提出挑战，需借助AI技术提升监测和预测能力。

Method: BioAnalyst基于Transformer架构，预训练于多模态数据集，支持下游任务微调。

Result: 模型在数据稀缺场景下优于现有方法，为生态预测设定了新基准。

Conclusion: BioAnalyst的开放旨在推动生物多样性建模合作，解决生态挑战。

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for
ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of
biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the
sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats,
including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive
species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local
and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and
conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation
Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by
leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to
various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity
conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model
tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst
employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal
datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,
climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,
allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species
distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species
detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's
performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability
compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two
distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological
forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to
the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in
biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological
challenges.

*Joel Becker,Nate Rush,Elizabeth Barnes,David Rein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管开发者预期AI工具能缩短任务完成时间，但实际上AI工具反而增加了19%的完成时间，与经济学和ML专家的预测相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI工具对实际软件开发中生产力的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过随机对照试验（RCT），让16名有中等AI经验的开发者完成246个任务，随机分配是否允许使用2025年的AI工具（如Cursor Pro和Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet）。

Result: AI工具的使用导致任务完成时间增加了19%，与开发者预期的20%缩短和专家预测的38-39%缩短相反。

Conclusion: AI工具在实际应用中可能因多种因素（如项目规模、质量标准或开发者经验）而降低生产力，这一现象值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development
in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the
productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate
AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an
average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow
or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers
primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.
Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce
completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that
allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing
AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers
down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%
shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and
evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could
contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality
standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although
the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the
robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely
to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化金融（DeFi）缺乏集中监管，导致市场操纵行为频发，需要一种去中心化的检测方法。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习框架，结合GRPO优化学习稳定性，基于理性预期和信息不对称设计奖励函数，并整合多模态数据（如LLM语义特征、社交图信号和链上数据）。

Result: 在真实数据和对抗模拟中验证，Hide-and-Shill系统在检测准确性和因果归因方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为去中心化市场情报提供了新范式，推动了多智能体系统与金融监管的结合。

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless
financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without
centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and
pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation
detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a
dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using
delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces
three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance
learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a
theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information
asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a
multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social
graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The
framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent
architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning
through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony
promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust
manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time
surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world
discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill
achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This
work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new
paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at
the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and
reproducibility.

Method: 分析了五个先进模型（如GPT-4o、GPT-4.1等）在93个真实任务中的12,000多个操作，开发了高精度检测系统。

Result: 21%的操作存在安全隐患，信息暴露（CWE-200）最常见；GPT-4.1的缓解成功率高达96.8%。

Conclusion: 研究为评估编程代理安全性提供了框架，并强调下一代LLM编程代理需注重安全设计。

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development,
yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while
capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce
insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of
autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five
state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world
software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of
agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial
variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system
that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure
(CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies
including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness
between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8%
mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for
evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware
design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

Conclusion: EduFlow通过动态优化和错误纠正机制，有效提升了科学任务中的多步推理能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific
tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning.
Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of
global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective
self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We
introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline
of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based
trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core
is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with
tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three
complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected
critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to
multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We
further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces
bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as
a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It
further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward
higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and
rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of
educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models
will be released.

Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and
next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true
in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly,
generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or
scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are
particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is,
investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI
systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and
query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper,
we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations
of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in
this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our
results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss
their impact and implications.

Conclusion: LLM-Stackelberg游戏为复杂决策领域提供了新的建模范式，尤其在涉及有限理性和信息不对称的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential
decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into
strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from
classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents,
our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts,
generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through
internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts:
reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal
prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning
equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized
models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded
rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We
illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and
a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This
example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of
LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide
a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as
cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Conclusion: 这一范式转变有望解决传统反应式框架无法处理的协调问题，推动自主系统、机器人和人机协作的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that
conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint
action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates
moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current
methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when
facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from
reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based
reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as
isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of
synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions
based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than
responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model
environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated
action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term
dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation
capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless
coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving
scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented
possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual
optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine
collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems,
robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination
challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

TL;DR: CTP是一种基于一致性轨迹模型的离线强化学习方法，通过单步轨迹生成实现高效优化，显著降低计算成本，并在性能上优于现有扩散模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在规划任务中计算成本高，CTP旨在解决这一问题，提供高效且高性能的离线规划方案。

Method: CTP利用一致性轨迹模型（CTM）进行单步轨迹生成，避免了迭代采样的高计算成本。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CTP在长时域任务中表现优于现有方法，且推理速度提升120倍。

Conclusion: CTP是一种实用且高效的离线规划方法，适用于高性能、低延迟的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline
model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed
Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While
prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong
performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation
without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL
benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based
planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves
higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In
particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup
in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for
high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Metropolis-Hastings采样的框架，用于训练脉冲神经网络（SNN）在强化学习任务中，避免了梯度方法的局限性，并在控制任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNN）在实时控制系统中具有生物启发和高效能的优势，但其训练因脉冲通信的不可微分性而面临挑战。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用Metropolis-Hastings（MH）采样，一种贝叶斯推断技术，通过迭代提出并概率接受参数更新，基于累积奖励信号训练SNN。

Result: 在AcroBot和CartPole两个控制基准测试中，该方法在最大化累积奖励、减少网络资源和训练周期方面优于传统深度Q学习和现有SNN方法。

Conclusion: MH采样框架为SNN在强化学习中的应用提供了一种有效的无梯度训练方法，展示了其在动态控制任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient
alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control
systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of
spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our
knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling,
a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL
environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach
iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates
based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations
of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic
platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks:
AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach
outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL
approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing
network resources and training episodes.

Conclusion: 神经符号框架有效支持机器人互操作性，但模型选择和集成策略是关键。

Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic
environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance.
These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks,
and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on
proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,
resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale
across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to
enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized
representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as
KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,
multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as
images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and
knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that
combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the
structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of
supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates
ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent
manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,
ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using
different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and
perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1
and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our
findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results,
highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating
ontology-compliant KGs.

Conclusion: 该工具包为多代理AI系统的公平性和鲁棒性建模提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The
regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees
of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents'
responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees
require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here,
we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic
control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties
of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a
closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these
interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity
associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of
multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have
demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics
and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences
(slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models
(fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge
that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for
trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference
resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the
practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is
crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning
between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive
thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,
and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers
quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive
thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

Result: Causal DQ显著减少了异常检测时间，适用于大规模实时数据流。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于传感器布局，还可推广到其他强化学习问题，为工程应用中的因果机器学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume
of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due
to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to
detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal
sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system
while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider
only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,
although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on
interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which
is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we
introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for
partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating
causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves
faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the
trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for
anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor
placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current
implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various
reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world
causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号推理提供了一个理论框架，既利用了LLM的知识，又保持了逻辑的健全性和完备性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with
logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs'
broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their
inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the
interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We
provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating
the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality
benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for
neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the
underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in
diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning
traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like
DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without
fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be
induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20
long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly
fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms
the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of
high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further
explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced
with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,
neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that
certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze
key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and
answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,
we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small
quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our
human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further
investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge
is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference
answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.
Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based
verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM
judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building
better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'
performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable
development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address
this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for
systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions
covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is
equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the
evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a
multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental
framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized
verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.
complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers
fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve
leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show
stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover
verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in
cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks
of current verifier technology.

TL;DR: OMDPG算法通过引入Optimal Marginal Q函数和Generalized Q Critic，解决了异构多智能体强化学习中单调改进与部分参数共享的冲突，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构多智能体强化学习（MARL）中，单调改进对性能提升至关重要，但部分参数共享（ParPS）与现有方法（如HAPPO）存在冲突，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出OMDPG算法：1）用Optimal Marginal Q函数替代顺序计算的Q函数；2）引入Generalized Q Critic优化Q值估计；3）采用CCGA架构实现ParPS和全局Q函数计算。

Result: 在SMAC和MAMuJoCo环境中，OMDPG优于多种先进的MARL基线方法。

Conclusion: OMDPG成功解决了单调改进与ParPS的冲突，显著提升了异构MARL的性能。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

Motivation: 探讨意图和语境在科学与技术中的实际意义，弥补Searle之后对意图研究的不足。

Method: 利用语义时空模型和多尺度异常检测，分离意图内容和环境语境，以过程一致性为衡量标准。

Result: 提供了一种低成本、无需大规模训练的计算方法，适用于基础生物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为潜在意图性提供了实用解释，但概念形成水平受限于代理的记忆能力。

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of
philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in
science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the
scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective
Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low
level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence
as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent
`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and
assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort
parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime
coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation
of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference
to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the
reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial
probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends,
however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

*Zijun Chen,Wenbo Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过利用模型内部真实性编码校准CoT推理的准确性，显著提升推理任务的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT推理在LLMs和MLLMs中表现出强大的深度推理能力，但中间步骤的错误累积会影响其可靠性。

Method: 利用特定注意力头激活反映推理步骤的真实性，训练置信度预测器动态选择最优推理路径。

Result: 在数学、符号和常识推理任务中显著优于现有基线，适用于单模态和多模态场景。

Conclusion: 为CoT推理提供了一种新的可靠性提升路径，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning
capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the
accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel
approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's
intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head
activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based
on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of
each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically
selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and
Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and
commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in
both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on
large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning
models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction
ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement
path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同知识图谱（KG）之间自动翻译SPARQL查询的能力，发现性能因模型和提示策略而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识图谱互操作性研究中SPARQL到SPARQL翻译的空白。

Method: 使用三种LLMs（Llama-3-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B、Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407），在零样本、少样本和思维链变体下测试。

Result: Wikidata到DBpedia的翻译效果优于反向，性能因模型和提示策略差异显著。

Conclusion: LLMs在SPARQL翻译中表现不一，需进一步优化模型和策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG)
schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and
later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG
interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on
SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first
align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100
DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic
KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures
and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs
were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find
that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,
and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations
for DBpedia to Wikidata.

*Anna Rapberger,Fabrizio Russo,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文填补了假设基础论证（ABA）中渐进语义学的空白，提出了一种新的渐进语义学家族，用于为ABA框架中的假设赋予辩证强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渐进语义学在计算论证中是一种细粒度的方法，但在假设基础论证（ABA）中尚未得到充分研究，尽管ABA是一种流行的结构化论证形式。

Method: 通过使用双极集基础论证框架作为ABA框架的抽象，并推广最先进的模块化渐进语义学，提出了一种新的渐进语义学家族。

Result: 提出的渐进ABA语义学满足平衡性和单调性等理想性质，并通过实验与基于论证的方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该研究为ABA框架提供了渐进语义学的新方法，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained
alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a
dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of
acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,
bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,
to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this
has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it
being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications
where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and
propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which
are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do
so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of
(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular
gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy
suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as
balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that
leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.
Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our
gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess
convergence.

Motivation: 随着AI系统能力的提升和普及，现有安全工具无法单独提供全面保障，需要集成化的方法。

Method: 开发了BlueGlass框架，支持多样安全工具的集成与组合，并在视觉语言模型上进行了三种安全性分析。

Result: 展示了分布评估、层次动态分析和稀疏自编码器三种分析方法的有效性，揭示了模型的潜在问题和学习机制。

Conclusion: BlueGlass为构建更健壮可靠的AI系统提供了基础性框架和发现。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety
of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target
different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in
isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This
paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI
safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration
and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and
outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present
three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object
detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and
potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer
dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and
(3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this
work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more
robust and reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Application migration in edge-cloud system enables high QoS and cost
effective service delivery. However, automatically orchestrating such migration

Decision Process (MDP), in this paper, we identify, analyze and compare
selected state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for solving the class of edge-cloud
application migration problems that can be modeled as Towers of Hanoi (ToH)
problems. We introduce a new classification based on state space definition and
analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand
available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in
emerging computing continuum environments.

### [196] [Could you be wrong: Debiasing LLMs using a metacognitive prompt for improving human decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10124)
*Thomas T. Hills*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用人类心理学中的元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）来减少大型语言模型（LLM）的偏见，展示了这种方法的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM仍在发展中，当前的偏见可能随时间变化，因此需要通用的去偏见策略。人类决策中的去偏见方法为LLM提供了借鉴。

Method: 采用元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）引导LLM在回答后提供额外信息，揭示潜在偏见和错误。

Result: 元认知提示能有效让LLM识别自身偏见、矛盾证据和替代答案，改善初始回答的局限性。

Conclusion: 人类心理学为LLM的提示工程提供了新思路，可借鉴其长期有效的决策改进方法。

Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,
what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies
for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for
debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they
incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge
into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of
information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and
contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if
prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making
literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show
promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"
Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional
information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,
contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their
initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and
users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a
set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including
implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be
wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent
metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing
but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive
prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for
prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based
improvements to human decision making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的在线飞行资源分配方案（FRSICL），用于优化无人机在野火监测中的飞行控制和数据收集调度，以最小化信息年龄（AoI）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在野火监测中至关重要，但现有深度强化学习（DRL）方法存在采样效率低、仿真与现实的差距等问题，不适合时间敏感应用。

Method: FRSICL利用自然语言任务描述和环境反馈，实时优化无人机的飞行控制和数据收集调度，无需大量重新训练。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FRSICL在最小化AoI方面优于PPO和最近邻基线方法。

Conclusion: FRSICL为无人机辅助野火监测提供了一种高效、动态的决策方案，解决了DRL的局限性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in
wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In
UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor
transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of
Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling
efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it
unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper
introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled
In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and
data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby
asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to
DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using
natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling
dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出多智能体强化学习（MARL）在动态现实环境中的适应性评估框架，以提升其实际部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MARL在模拟环境中表现优异，但其在动态复杂的现实多智能体系统中应用受限，亟需适应性评估方法。

Method: 引入适应性概念，提出包含学习适应性、策略适应性和场景驱动适应性的三维框架。

Result: 通过适应性视角，支持更全面的MARL性能评估，超越传统基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于开发更适合动态现实环境的MARL算法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in
coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained
scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)
remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such
environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of
variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and
inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL
algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations
and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for
adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and
practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL
algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the
environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on
the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three
key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven
adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more
principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.
Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are
better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动饮食评估系统常忽略非视觉因素（如食材替代和个人饮食需求），且瑞士缺乏整合相关信息的集中资源。

Method: 构建SwissFKG，利用LLM增强图谱内容，并开发Graph-RAG应用展示其功能。

Result: LLM能有效丰富图谱营养信息，SwissFKG提供食材级信息和营养指南支持。

Conclusion: SwissFKG为结合视觉、背景和文化维度的下一代饮食评估工具提供了基础。

Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through
multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic
dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as
recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter
nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including
allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In
Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains
fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant
nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we
introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our
best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with
nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national
nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment
pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first
benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge
augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the
graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe
recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and
dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional
guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the
SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer
user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by
comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,
our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment
tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

Motivation: 探讨DT在稀疏奖励环境中是否优于传统方法，以及DT是否在任何情况下都是最优选择。

Method: 在Robomimic和D4RL基准上实验比较DT和FBC的性能。FBC通过过滤低质量轨迹后进行行为克隆。

Result: FBC在稀疏奖励环境中表现优于DT，且更高效。

Conclusion: DT在稀疏奖励环境中并非最优选择，甚至在其他环境中也可能不占优，引发对其适用性的质疑。

Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the
Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,
Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of
offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned
policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.
(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based
offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in
sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks
(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered
Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing
trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on
the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also
requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results
therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.
From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward
environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis
tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design
recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI
assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,
cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and
comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified
the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,
and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should
specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to
illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study
guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's
ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can
help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant
to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory
results regarding XAI design.

heterogeneity, and semantic complexity--issues underexplored in existing
research that primarily targets clean academic datasets. This survey focuses on
LLM-based Table Agents, which aim to automate table-centric workflows by

core competencies--C1: Table Structure Understanding, C2: Table and Query
Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable
Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze
and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the
Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and
real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide
actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency
of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.

Abstract: This paper seeks to advance CVRP research by addressing the challenge of
understanding the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and
metaheuristic (MH) performance. We present Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a
valuable tool that allows for a new perspective on the field. By combining the
ISA methodology with a dataset from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge on
Vehicle Routing, our research enabled the identification of 23 relevant
instance characteristics. Our use of the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages,
which employ dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods, allowed us
to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how
the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of
our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward
to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for
instance analysis in the CVRP field.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early
detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance.
Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely
researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning
platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources,
including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to
accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model
that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic
and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We
fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were
then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in
XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year,
achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model.
Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics,
such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in
developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage
student perseverance

task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,
due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational
models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational
immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our
work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of
priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we
demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on
non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that
our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire
more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene
generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a
handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We
then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel
scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed
scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a
pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,
addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

*Peican Zhu,Yubo Jing,Le Cheng,Keke Tang,Yangming Guo*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KEN的新方法，通过知识增强和情感引导网络，结合LVLM的语义理解和世界知识，提升多模态假新闻检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上虚假信息的泛滥使得多模态假新闻检测成为研究重点，但现有方法未能充分理解图像语义，且缺乏对不同情感类型新闻的针对性处理。

Method: 利用LVLM生成图像描述和检索文本证据，结合平衡学习对不同情感类型新闻进行细粒度建模。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明KEN具有优越性。

Conclusion: KEN通过知识增强和情感引导，显著提升了多模态假新闻检测的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has
made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus.
However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of
images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual
information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without
tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we
propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On
the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding
and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a
comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the
retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and
limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class
differences between different emotional types of news through balanced
learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional
types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ESG-Net的方法，通过多阶段语义引导和多事件关系建模，解决了密集视听事件定位中的模态语义鸿沟和事件相关性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏中间层的跨模态语义桥接，导致模态语义鸿沟，且忽略事件间的相关性，限制了模型在复杂场景中的表现。

Method: 提出ESG-Net，包含早期语义交互模块（ESI）和依赖专家混合模块（MoDE），分别实现多阶段语义引导和多事件依赖关系建模。

Result: 实验表明，ESG-Net显著超越现有方法，同时大幅减少参数和计算量。

Conclusion: ESG-Net通过多阶段语义引导和事件依赖建模，有效提升了密集视听事件定位的性能和效率。

Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event
categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies
only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking
cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality
semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between
event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely
consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer
concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate
multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which
respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events
and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on
event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network
(ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of
dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to
explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through
multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring
hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the
extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of
experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly
reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on
https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.

Motivation: 解决现有深度伪造检测工具因技术术语过多而难以被普通用户理解的问题，提升透明度和用户信任。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：可解释的深度伪造检测、技术解释的自然语言简化、通过图像编辑重建原始图像。

Result: 用户研究表明，简化解释显著提高了清晰度并降低了认知负荷，用户对识别深度伪造的信心增强。

Conclusion: LayLens为透明、可信且以用户为中心的深度伪造取证迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: This demonstration paper presents $\mathbf{LayLens}$, a tool aimed to make
deepfake understanding easier for users of all educational backgrounds. While
prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges
the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage
pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery
localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical
explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a
plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both
technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side
comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15
participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity
and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in
identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy,
and user-centric deepfake forensics.

Motivation: 现有视频到音频（V2A）模型忽视了语音的重要性，而语音是许多视频音轨的关键部分。

Method: 提出了DualDub框架，包含多模态编码器、跨模态对齐器和双解码头，采用因果和非因果注意力机制提升同步性和声学和谐性，并使用课程学习策略解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: 实验表明DualDub在V2ST任务上达到最先进性能，生成高质量且同步的音轨。

Conclusion: DualDub为视频音轨生成提供了统一框架，并通过DualBench基准验证了其有效性。

Abstract: While recent video-to-audio (V2A) models can generate realistic background
audio from visual input, they largely overlook speech, an essential part of
many video soundtracks. This paper proposes a new task, video-to-soundtrack
(V2ST) generation, which aims to jointly produce synchronized background audio
and speech within a unified framework. To tackle V2ST, we introduce DualDub, a
unified framework built on a multimodal language model that integrates a
multimodal encoder, a cross-modal aligner, and dual decoding heads for
simultaneous background audio and speech generation. Specifically, our proposed
cross-modal aligner employs causal and non-causal attention mechanisms to
improve synchronization and acoustic harmony. Besides, to handle data scarcity,
we design a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds the
multimodal capability. Finally, we introduce DualBench, the first benchmark for
V2ST evaluation with a carefully curated test set and comprehensive metrics.
Experimental results demonstrate that DualDub achieves state-of-the-art
performance, generating high-quality and well-synchronized soundtracks with
both speech and background audio.

TL;DR: Spatial ModernBERT模型通过结合空间嵌入和Transformer架构，高效地从复杂财务文档中提取表格和键值对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格和键值对提取对审计、数据分析和自动化发票处理等业务流程至关重要。

Method: 模型采用三个分类头（标签、列、行）进行标记分类，预训练后微调，并通过后处理方法重建表格布局和键值对。

Result: 实验表明，Spatial ModernBERT结合文本和空间线索，显著提升了提取准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型为财务文档中的表格和键值对提取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一个多语言安全护栏，旨在解决现有护栏在多语言安全对齐上的不足，显著提升对多语言不安全及越狱提示的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入（尤其是低资源语言）上表现不佳，导致LLM系统易受攻击。

Method: 通过低秩适应（LoRA）将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建SEALSBench数据集（含26万条多语言提示）。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言检测中表现优异，DSR提升48%，优于LlamaGuard，且在精确率和F1分数上均领先。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效多语言护栏显著提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在医学问答中的表现时，现有数据集缺乏临床真实性、透明性和验证过程，亟需改进。

Method: 通过审查MedQA、MedMCQA、PubMedQA和MMLU等常用数据集，以及医学期刊中的挑战性问题，分析其优缺点。

Result: 现有数据集普遍缺乏临床现实性和透明度，挑战性问题虽有益但规模小、范围窄且可能被LLM训练过。

Conclusion: 需建立标准化框架和多方协作，以确保数据集和方法严谨、无偏且能反映临床复杂性。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型引导方法依赖外部标注数据，限制了其适应性和效果。SIMS旨在通过自改进机制解决这一问题。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准测试中，SIMS在引导效果和适应性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理对齐研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

Motivation: 探讨视觉想象力差异如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容，以验证视觉系统的生成能力与个体差异的关系。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具分析4000多名参与者的自由文本描述，比较不同想象力表型（无、典型、生动）的幻觉内容差异。

Result: 强想象力者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象力者报告简单几何模式；视觉语言模型比纯文本模型更能捕捉这些差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明视觉想象力差异可能反映了早期视觉区与高阶区域协调的个体差异。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lizard是一种线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer大语言模型转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了内存和计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在长上下文场景下因softmax注意力的二次复杂度和KV缓存增长面临内存和计算瓶颈，Lizard旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Lizard引入次二次注意力机制，结合门控模块和混合机制（全局线性注意力与滑动窗口注意力），并优化训练算法。

Result: 实验显示Lizard在语言建模任务中几乎无损恢复教师模型性能，在MMLU基准上提升18分，关联召回任务表现显著改进。

Conclusion: Lizard通过灵活的门控和混合机制，实现了高效的长上下文处理，性能优于现有线性化方法。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

Conclusion: ALIGN为可靠、负责任和个性化的LLM决策者研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

### [221] [Dynamic Parameter Memory: Temporary LoRA-Enhanced LLM for Long-Sequence Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09076)
*Jialong Mai,Xiaofen Xing,Yawei Li,Zhipeng Li,Jingyuan Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，通过上下文语义和句子级情感编码，解决了语音大语言模型（SLLM）在处理长音频时的限制，显著提升了情感识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理和理解能力，现有方法忽视了情感在多轮对话中的连续性和惯性。

Method: 提出DPM机制，逐步将句子级信息和情感编码到临时LoRA模块中，以记忆上下文信息。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM处理长音频序列的情感识别能力，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效解决了SLLM在长音频处理中的限制，提升了情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: CompassJudger-2是一种新型通用评判模型，通过任务驱动的多领域数据策略提升评判能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评判模型存在专业狭窄和鲁棒性不足的问题，限制了其全面评估能力。

Method: 采用任务驱动的多领域数据策略，结合可验证奖励和监督学习，通过拒绝采样和边际策略梯度损失提升性能。

Result: CompassJudger-2在多个评判和奖励基准测试中表现优异，7B模型与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了鲁棒、可扩展的LLM评判，并建立了新的性能和评估标准。

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

TL;DR: OPENXRD是一个用于晶体学问答的开卷管道，结合GPT-4.5生成的简明支持内容，提升小模型在X射线衍射（XRD）任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扫描教材可能带来的版权问题，同时填补小模型在晶体学领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考内容，并在217个专家级XRD问题上评估不同视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成摘要的模型在准确性上有显著提升，尤其是在晶体学训练有限的情况下。

Conclusion: OPENXRD展示了开卷系统在材料科学中的实用性，并为科学领域的NLP工具提供了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模型PU-Lie，结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释特征和PU学习目标，用于检测战略对话中的欺骗信息，在Diplomacy数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略对话中的欺骗检测因语言微妙性和类别不平衡（欺骗信息占比极低）而极具挑战性，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 采用冻结BERT嵌入、可解释的语用和游戏特定特征，结合PU学习目标，专门针对少量标注欺骗信息的情况。

Result: 模型在Diplomacy数据集上达到0.60的宏F1值，同时减少了650倍以上的可训练参数。

Conclusion: PU学习、语用可解释性和说话者感知表示在此类问题中至关重要，准确检测欺骗信息比识别真实信息更重要。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常依赖数据集特定的相关性机制，导致在新任务或分布上性能下降。

Method: 使用Integrated Gradients量化神经元对高置信度预测的影响，剪枝与数据集特定机制相关的神经元。

Result: 在多选题基准测试中，该方法显著提升性能，优于非剪枝的适应方法。

Conclusion: 剪枝微调方法有效增强模型的泛化能力，减少对数据集特定机制的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

Result: Banzhida在多种任务中显著优于同类开源模型和专门针对藏语的模型。

Conclusion: 研究填补了藏语在生成式AI中的空白，为低资源语言处理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

Motivation: 探索视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中的实际效果，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 创建MetaClimage数据库，包含视觉隐喻和字面图像，并通过人类评分和自然语言处理分析其效果。

Result: 视觉隐喻被认为更难理解但更美观，未在效果和情绪唤起上与字面图像有显著差异，但能引发更多标签和更积极的情绪。

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中具有潜在优势，但需权衡其认知负荷和美学价值。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

Motivation: 幽默翻译在跨文化交流中至关重要，但现有大语言模型（LLMs）在幽默翻译中表现不佳，存在语言干扰和幽默缺失问题。

Method: 采用心理学启发的幽默分解机制（HDM），结合思维链（CoT）模仿人类思维过程，并融入幽默理论以增强翻译文本的幽默元素。

Result: 在开源幽默数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了幽默翻译质量，幽默性、流畅性和连贯性分别平均提升7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM方法有效解决了LLMs在幽默翻译中的局限性，为跨文化幽默交流提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15

Result: 研究发现，没有单一方法在所有任务中表现最优，且方法性能受任务设计影响。

Conclusion: DATE-LM为未来语言模型数据归属研究提供了基础，并发布了公开排行榜以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter
tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key
modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Our dataset and code will be released at

*Junjie Liu,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的ABSA方法，通过数据增强生成平衡的训练数据，并结合强化学习优化数据质量，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ABSA任务中因短文本、数据量小且不平衡（多为正面情感）导致模型难以学习上下文信息的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成增强的训练数据，并通过强化学习优化数据质量，构建更大规模且标签平衡的训练集。

Result: 在英文ABSA基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强和强化学习优化，有效提升了ABSA任务的性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

TL;DR: GoalfyMax是一个协议驱动的多智能体协作框架，通过标准化通信和分层记忆系统提升自主性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单用途AI系统在协调性、记忆重用和任务分解方面不足，难以适应复杂动态的企业环境。

Method: GoalfyMax基于Model Context Protocol（MCP）实现智能体间异步通信，采用Experience Pack（XP）架构实现分层记忆和持续学习。

Result: 在复杂任务编排基准测试中，GoalfyMax展现出优于基线框架的适应性、协调性和经验重用能力。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来解决方案。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出Ref-Long基准，用于评估长上下文语言模型在长上下文引用任务中的表现，发现现有模型（包括GPT-4o）存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文引用任务在长上下文语言模型中的研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计Ref-Long基准，包含三个子集（合成到现实场景），要求模型识别引用特定关键词的文档索引。

Result: 实验显示13个长上下文语言模型在引用任务中表现不佳，进一步分析揭示了关键问题。

Conclusion: Ref-Long基准揭示了长上下文引用任务的挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译中表现优异，但对提示中的错误和扰动敏感，研究旨在系统评估这种影响。

Method: 通过定量和定性分析，评估不同类型和程度的提示错误对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 提示质量显著影响翻译性能，字符级和组合噪声比短语扰动更严重；LLM在人类难以理解的噪声下仍能翻译。

Conclusion: 提示错误主要影响指令遵循而非翻译质量本身，LLM对噪声的鲁棒性较强。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

Abstract: Definition modeling, the task of generating new definitions for words in
context, holds great prospect as a means to assist the work of lexicographers
in documenting a broader variety of lects and languages, yet much remains to be
done in order to assess how we can leverage pre-existing models for as-of-yet
unsupported languages. In this work, we focus on adapting existing models to
Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our
experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

TL;DR: NMIXX是一种针对金融领域的跨语言嵌入模型，通过高置信度三元组微调，显著提升了金融语义的捕捉能力，尤其是在韩语等低资源语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型在金融领域（尤其是低资源语言如韩语）表现不佳，主要因领域术语、语义时变和双语词汇不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出NMIXX模型，利用18.8K高置信度三元组（包括领域内释义、语义偏移负样本和韩英精确翻译）进行微调，并发布KorFinSTS基准数据集。

Result: NMIXX在英语FinSTS和韩语KorFinSTS上分别提升Spearman's rho 0.10和0.22，优于其他基线模型，但通用STS性能略有下降。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS的发布为金融领域的跨语言表示学习提供了实用工具，同时强调了分词设计在低资源语言中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Motivation: 开发SpreadPy的目的是为了通过数值模拟测试认知过程中的结构-功能关系，并与知识建模的理论进行比较，以揭示激活动态如何反映认知、心理和临床现象。

Method: SpreadPy通过模拟激活扩散在认知网络中的传播，支持使用经验或理论网络建模，并通过三个案例研究验证其效用。

Result: 案例研究表明，SpreadPy能够区分数学焦虑学生的概念组织结构差异、揭示认知负荷对词汇访问的影响，以及将网络结构与临床语言障碍相关联。

Conclusion: SpreadPy提供了一个灵活的框架，支持心理学、神经科学和教育研究中的可重复研究，帮助理解个体差异和认知障碍的机制。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our
experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We
release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support

Method: 采用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，结合BGE-M3嵌入作为语义相似性奖励，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在NitiBench基准测试中，GRPO实现了90%的引用F1提升和31%的联合质量指标提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂法律推理任务中表现出更强的鲁棒性，为泰国法律LLMs提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

Result: 实验显示性能差异与训练数据分布和语言-文化对齐相关，并揭示了公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

Method: 对11个基于Transformer的解码器模型进行大规模实证研究，分析6个科学主题和12层的隐藏状态。

Result: 高层语义信息在低维子空间中线性可分，深层和结构化推理提示下可分性更强。几何特性支持简单有效的因果干预。

Conclusion: 潜在空间的几何特性为开发检测和防御有害内容的工具提供了基础，如通过轻量级分类器实现潜在空间防护。

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标（如文本长度），可能无法准确反映模型视角，因此需要一种自适应方法。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型预测样本难度分数，并探索不同训练策略（从易到难、从难到易、混合采样）进行微调。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上验证，结果显示该方法比随机采样收敛更快且性能更好。

Conclusion: 自适应课程学习范式能有效提升模型训练效率和性能，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

Method: 提出新定义，创建数据集TA1C，包含3,500条标注推文，并实现高基线性能。

Result: 数据集标注一致性达0.825 Fleiss' K，基线模型F1分数0.84。

Conclusion: 新定义和数据集为点击诱饵研究提供了更清晰的标准和资源。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中可复用和可组合的结构如何支持任务级泛化。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义信息，缺乏对文本结构的考虑，导致检索效果不佳。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TinyRM是一种小型双向掩码语言模型，参数仅4亿，性能媲美175倍大的模型，适用于奖励建模任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型在奖励建模中推理成本高的问题。

Method: 结合FLAN风格提示、定向低秩适应（DoRA）和层冻结技术。

Result: 在RewardBench上表现优异，资源消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: 轻量级双向架构在偏好建模中具有高效、可扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

TL;DR: TextOmics是一个开创性基准，通过建立组学表达与分子文本描述的一一对应关系，提供异构数据集。基于此，提出了ToDi生成框架，结合组学表达和分子文本描述生成生物相关、化学有效的分子。


<details>

Motivation: 解决靶向药物发现中缺乏异构数据和统一框架的问题。

Method: 引入TextOmics基准和ToDi生成框架，利用两个编码器（OmicsEn和TextEn）捕获多级生物和语义关联，并开发条件扩散（DiffGen）进行可控生成。

Result: 实验证明TextOmics的有效性，ToDi优于现有方法，并在零样本治疗分子生成中表现出潜力。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了新的工具和框架，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

*Jun Li,Xiangmeng Wang,Haoyang Li,Yifei Yan,Hong Va Leong,Ling Feng,Nancy Xiaonan Yu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新框架，通过联合学习风险和保护因素对自杀风险的动态影响，预测后续自杀风险，并显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注风险因素，忽略了保护因素的作用，且缺乏对自杀风险动态变化的预测能力。

Method: 提出了一种动态因素影响学习方法，结合风险和保护因素，构建了一个包含12年Reddit帖子的数据集。

Result: 模型在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为自杀风险预测提供了更全面的视角，有助于临床干预策略的制定。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

TL;DR: GeLaCo是一种基于进化的LLM压缩方法，通过层折叠和模块相似性评估，高效探索压缩解空间，支持单目标和多目标优化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的计算需求高，部署和使用受限，模型压缩是解决这一问题的关键。现有方法如结构化剪枝成本高且可能忽略更优解。

Method: GeLaCo采用进化方法，通过层折叠和模块相似性评估（注意力、前馈网络和隐藏状态表示）进行压缩解空间搜索。

Result: GeLaCo在基础模型和指令调优模型上，通过困惑度和生成评估，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供了高效且多目标的解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）无法准确代表多元文化道德框架，尽管其语言能力强，但会系统性地同质化道德多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能真正代表人类多元价值观，而非简单平均化。

Method: 通过应用道德基础问卷，在19种文化背景下比较LLMs与人类道德直觉的差异。

Result: LLMs在道德多样性表现上存在显著缺陷，模型规模增大并未改善文化代表性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更实际的AI对齐目标和评估指标，以确保AI系统能代表多元人类价值观。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ReFT方法在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，因其固定位置表征对输出的影响不确定。研究发现关键表征对推理性能有重要影响。

Method: 提出CRFT方法，通过信息流分析识别关键表征，并在低秩线性子空间中动态优化，同时冻结基础模型。

Result: 在八个算术和常识推理基准测试中验证了CRFT的有效性和高效性，少样本设置下性能提升16.4%。

Conclusion: CRFT展示了表征级优化在推理任务中的潜力，为传统PEFT方法提供了轻量且强大的替代方案。

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM和Transformer的新架构，通过融合两者的表示来提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在时间序列预测中表现不佳，因其擅长处理离散文本而非连续数值数据；而纯Transformer缺乏高级语义模式学习能力。

Method: 设计了一种新型Transformer架构，融合LLM的高级语义表示和Transformer的时间信息编码，生成混合表示。

Result: 实验表明，该模型能更准确地预测未来值。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLM和Transformer的优势，有效提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外参数的任务特征蒸馏方法，解决传统特征蒸馏中师生模型隐藏层尺寸不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法假设师生模型隐藏层尺寸相同，限制了学生模型的灵活性；线性投影方法引入额外参数且可能降低性能。

Method: 基于任务的特征蒸馏方法，识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活蒸馏到学生模型。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务上，性能提升高达3%，优于线性投影基线。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且无需额外参数，适用于不同隐藏层尺寸的师生模型，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在识别和转换辱骂性文本方面的效果仍需探索。

Method: 使用LLMs识别并转换辱骂性文本（如推文和评论），保持文本意图的同时去除辱骂内容，并通过情感和语义分析评估原始与转换后的数据集。

Result: Groq的表现与其他模型差异显著，而GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3表现相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在辱骂性文本转换中表现不一，Groq与其他模型差异明显，GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3效果相近。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

Motivation: 现有提示工程方法主要针对简单任务和大型LLMs，而复杂任务和小型LLMs对提示设计更敏感，需优化更多文本。

Method: 采用两阶段进化搜索：第一阶段通过语法引导的遗传编程合成提示创建程序；第二阶段通过局部搜索进一步微调性能。

Result: 在三个小型通用LLMs和四个领域特定任务中，优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂任务和小型LLMs中表现优异，性能退化极少。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP模型取得了进展，但其对对抗攻击的鲁棒性仍不足，尤其是循环网络和现代状态空间模型（如S4）的研究较少。这些架构的序列处理和复杂参数动态性带来了独特挑战。

Method: 引入GBM正则化技术，通过减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响，提升模型鲁棒性。方法在LSTM、S4和CNN三种架构上进行了验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗鲁棒性上比现有基线提高了8.8%，并在对抗防御中优于多种先进方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法有效提升了NLP模型的对抗鲁棒性，尤其是在LSTM、S4和CNN架构上表现突出，为SSM（S4）的鲁棒性研究提供了首次系统分析。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Motivation: 研究动机是验证LLMs（如GPT-4）是否能复现人类在语言学任务中的细微判断，并探索其在语言学研究中的潜在应用。

Method: 方法包括四项心理语言学实验，分别涉及情感意义的生成、情感变化、情感语境中的动词选择以及句子与表情符号的关联。实验先在人类参与者中进行，随后用LLM复现。

Result: 结果显示人类与AI的反应高度一致（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），仅在少数情况下存在微小差异，但不影响整体解释结果。

Conclusion: 结论支持LLMs作为语言学研究中可信赖的辅助工具，能够扩展研究规模而不损害解释有效性，并为假设生成和数据扩展提供了新可能性。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

Method: 提出三层模型：内容分析、概念融合和语用意，通过统一框架实现隐喻的深层理解。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更丰富、更具认知基础的隐喻解释方法。

Conclusion: 该分层框架为隐喻理解的计算方法奠定了基础，支持更深层次、更上下文敏感的推理。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Result: 发现Transformer能有效提取属性图（如分子图）的子结构，并展示其在复杂模式提取中的能力。

Conclusion: 序列化Transformer通过子结构思维高效处理图数据，为图推理任务提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在异步指令对话中提出澄清问题的能力及其与人类行为的差异。

Method: 结合现有语料库，比较LLMs与人类在模糊性情况下提出澄清问题的行为，并测试不同推理方法的影响。

Result: 人类较少为指代模糊提问，而更多为任务不确定性提问；LLMs则相反。推理能力提升LLMs提问频率和相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs的澄清问题能力可能依赖于其推理能力，但与人类行为差异显著。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

Motivation: 在线平台需平衡仇恨言论过滤与言论自由，但现有模型效果有限，新模型潜力未经验证。

Method: 通过基准测试比较经典双向Transformer编码器和超大规模自回归LLM在仇恨言论检测任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果将揭示超大规模LLM是否在实际应用中优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 研究为在线平台选择高效仇恨言论检测模型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Online platforms struggle to curb hate speech without over-censoring
legitimate discourse. Early bidirectional transformer encoders made big
strides, but the arrival of ultra-large autoregressive LLMs promises deeper
context-awareness. Whether this extra scale actually improves practical
hate-speech detection on real-world text remains unverified. Our study puts
this question to the test by benchmarking both model families, classic encoders
and next-generation LLMs, on curated corpora of online interactions for
hate-speech detection (Hate or No Hate).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RPA框架的MLAR系统，利用LLM技术优化招聘流程，显著提升了简历处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统招聘流程在简历筛选和候选人短名单上存在效率瓶颈，MLAR旨在通过自动化技术解决这些问题。

Method: MLAR采用三层LLM技术：提取职位关键特征、解析简历信息、语义匹配候选人，并与现有RPA流程无缝集成。

Result: 在处理2400份简历时，MLAR平均每份简历耗时5.4秒，比主流RPA平台效率提升16.9%-17.1%。

Conclusion: MLAR为现代招聘需求提供了高效、准确且可扩展的解决方案，具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and
scalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.

TL;DR: 论文比较了扩散生成文本（LLaDA）和自回归生成文本（LLaMA）的检测效果，发现LLaDA在困惑度和突发性上更接近人类文本，导致基于自回归的检测器误判率高。


<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，如何可靠检测AI生成文本成为问题，尤其是扩散模型的效果未知。

Method: 使用2000个样本，系统比较了LLaDA和LLaMA生成的文本，分析了困惑度、突发性、词汇多样性等指标。

Result: LLaDA在困惑度和突发性上接近人类文本，而LLaMA困惑度低但词汇保真度差。单一指标无法区分扩散生成文本和人类写作。

Conclusion: 需要开发针对扩散模型的检测方法，如混合模型、扩散特定风格特征或鲁棒水印。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) 是一种结合参数共享和自适应计算的高效框架，通过递归Transformer实现，显著降低计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型扩展时的高计算和内存成本问题，同时实现参数共享和自适应计算。

Method: MoR 通过共享层和轻量级路由器动态分配递归深度，选择性缓存活跃token的键值对，并提出KV共享变体以减少预填充延迟。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数范围内，MoR在相同训练FLOPs下显著降低验证困惑度，提高少样本准确率，并提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR 是实现高质量大模型而不增加成本的有效路径。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CodeJudgeBench，一个专门用于评估LLM作为代码任务裁判性能的基准测试，发现思考型模型表现更优，但裁判结果存在随机性和敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏专门基准测试，LLM作为裁判在代码任务中的有效性尚未充分研究，因此开发CodeJudgeBench填补这一空白。

Method: 通过CodeJudgeBench对26个LLM裁判模型在代码生成、修复和单元测试生成任务中进行全面评估，并研究最佳提示策略。

Result: 思考型模型显著优于非思考型模型，但裁判结果受响应顺序和内容影响，存在随机性和性能波动。

Conclusion: LLM作为裁判在代码任务中表现不稳定，需优化提示策略以提高可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

TL;DR: REST框架通过同时测试多个问题，评估大型推理模型在压力下的表现，揭示了现有基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅评估单问题推理，无法反映模型在真实多任务环境中的表现，且易受数据污染影响。

Method: 提出REST框架，同时测试多个问题，评估模型的优先级分配、抗干扰和认知负载管理能力。

Result: SOTA模型在压力测试下表现显著下降，REST比单问题测试更具区分力。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、面向未来的评估范式，更贴近真实推理需求，减少对人标注的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

Conclusion: THOR模块通过模式感知、容错执行和合规保护，实现了零SQL复杂度的企业级数据访问。

Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval)
Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that
transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics
for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled
orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema
Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation
Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail.
An integrated Self-Correction & Rating loop captures empty results, execution
errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration
attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise,
human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight & Intelligence engine
for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate
reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema
awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module
empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and
enterprise-grade safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统Spactula在大型摄像头网络中准确性有限，且不支持高召回率的关键视频分析应用。

Method: Tracer利用循环网络建模长期历史相关性，选择最优摄像头处理；采用概率自适应搜索模型加速查询。

Result: Tracer在多样化数据集上平均性能优于现有技术3.9倍。

Conclusion: Tracer通过自适应处理和合成基准解决了现有系统的局限性，显著提升了Re-ID查询效率。

Abstract: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras
is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the
state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID
queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal
filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized
camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications
that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query
processing.
  In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing
Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the
optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to
model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high
recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model
that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically
updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy.
To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy
concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera
Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows
that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by
3.9x on average across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 在线社交网络中健康虚假信息的快速传播对公共卫生和社会稳定构成挑战，传统中心性度量方法在动态网络中的局限性促使研究新方法。

Method: 引入动态影响力中心性（DIC）、健康虚假信息脆弱性中心性（MVC）和传播中心性（PC），结合时间动态和多层网络交互，使用FibVID和Monant数据集验证。

Result: 新方法比传统方法多识别出44.83%的关键节点，干预效果提升25%。在第二个数据集上验证了方法的普适性。

Conclusion: 结合传统和新中心性度量方法能更有效地理解和抑制健康虚假信息的传播。

Abstract: The rapid spread of health misinformation on online social networks (OSNs)
during global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to public
health, social stability, and institutional trust. Centrality metrics have long
been pivotal in understanding the dynamics of information flow, particularly in
the context of health misinformation. However, the increasing complexity and
dynamism of online networks, especially during crises, highlight the
limitations of these traditional approaches. This study introduces and compares
three novel centrality metrics: dynamic influence centrality (DIC), health
misinformation vulnerability centrality (MVC), and propagation centrality (PC).
These metrics incorporate temporal dynamics, susceptibility, and multilayered
network interactions. Using the FibVID dataset, we compared traditional and
novel metrics to identify influential nodes, propagation pathways, and
misinformation influencers. Traditional metrics identified 29 influential
nodes, while the new metrics uncovered 24 unique nodes, resulting in 42
combined nodes, an increase of 44.83%. Baseline interventions reduced health
misinformation by 50%, while incorporating the new metrics increased this to
62.5%, an improvement of 25%. To evaluate the broader applicability of the
proposed metrics, we validated our framework on a second dataset, Monant
Medical Misinformation, which covers a diverse range of health misinformation
discussions beyond COVID-19. The results confirmed that the advanced metrics
generalised successfully, identifying distinct influential actors not captured
by traditional methods. In general, the findings suggest that a combination of
traditional and novel centrality measures offers a more robust and
generalisable framework for understanding and mitigating the spread of health
misinformation in different online network contexts.

frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of
96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined
model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving
a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of
99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that
by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to
achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during
this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future
research.

*Gabriel G. Gattaux,Julien R. Serres,Franck Ruffier,Antoine Wystrach*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于蚂蚁视觉归巢行为的生物启发方法，首次在真实世界中实现了一种侧向化蘑菇体（MB）架构，用于小型自主车辆的视觉归巢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受蚂蚁在极少量感官输入和少量学习行走下实现稳健视觉归巢的启发，研究旨在开发一种资源高效的自主导航解决方案。

Method: 通过侧向化MB架构，利用角路径积分（PI）信号对全景视图进行分类，存储在“目标在左”和“目标在右”的记忆库中。实验分为四个阶段：模拟、解耦学习行走、随机行走和精确停止行为。

Result: 系统在自然户外环境中实现了稳健的视觉归巢，运行频率为8 Hz，内存占用低于9 kB。

Conclusion: 该方法为自主视觉归巢提供了一种生物启发的资源高效解决方案，功能上类似于机器人中的基于路点的位置控制。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于摄像头-LiDAR融合的高清语义地图生成框架，并发布了RS-seq数据集，用于研究路边智能单元（IRU）数据的跨模态互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车辆方法在复杂交叉路口的高清语义地图生成中存在遮挡和视角限制的问题，需要更高效的多模态解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段融合框架，结合摄像头的高分辨率纹理和LiDAR的精确几何数据，进行模态特征提取和跨模态语义整合。

Result: 在RS-seq数据集上，多模态方法的语义分割mIoU比单模态图像和点云分别提高了4%和18%。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于IRU的高清语义地图生成提供了基准方法和数据集，推动了基础设施辅助自动驾驶系统的发展。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MRMEL的新框架，用于设计自主车辆（AVs）的拉格朗日交通控制策略，通过动态选择最优策略来适应多样化的交通场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定位置的交通控制方法（如交通信号）难以适应多样化的交通场景，而AVs作为移动执行器可以更灵活地控制交通流。然而，设计通用的控制策略面临多代理系统、混合动机和冲突优化目标等挑战。

Method: MRMEL框架通过增强次优名义策略，学习残差修正，并动态选择最适合的名义策略（基于交通场景的专家混合模型）。

Result: 在真实交通场景的案例研究中，MRMEL实现了比基线方法额外4%-9%的车辆排放减少。

Conclusion: MRMEL为拉格朗日交通控制提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够适应多样化的交通场景并显著提升性能。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUIDER是一个概率框架，通过双阶段（导航和操作）估计人类意图，显著提升了人机协作中的意图推断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高人机协作中的人类意图推断准确性，避免限制人类控制或引发冲突。

Method: GUIDER采用双阶段框架：导航阶段结合控制器速度和占用网格生成Synergy Map；操作阶段结合U2Net、FastSAM和几何抓取可行性测试，实时更新对象概率。

Result: 在25次试验中，GUIDER导航稳定性达93-100%（优于BOIR的60-100%），操作稳定性达94-100%（优于Trajectron的69-100%），且在几何约束任务中更快识别意图。

Conclusion: GUIDER的双阶段框架显著提升了移动操作任务中意图推断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: SC-ADAS是一个结合生成式AI的模块化框架，通过多轮对话和场景感知提供自适应驾驶辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ADAS系统缺乏场景理解和自然语言交互能力，限制了其动态适应性和灵活性。

Method: SC-ADAS整合大型语言模型、视觉到文本解释和结构化功能调用，支持基于视觉和传感器上下文的多轮对话。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中实现，系统展示了场景感知和对话交互的可行性，但存在延迟和令牌增长的权衡。

Conclusion: SC-ADAS证明了结合对话推理、场景感知和模块化控制是下一代智能驾驶辅助的可行方向。

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Motivation: 触觉对人类和机器人至关重要，尤其在灵巧操作、材料识别和视觉遮挡场景中。Octopi-1.5旨在推动触觉基础模型的发展。

Method: Octopi-1.5采用多部位触觉信号处理和RAG模块，结合手持触觉接口TMI（配备GelSight和TAC-02传感器）进行交互。

Result: 模型能够通过触觉输入和常识知识解决推理任务，例如识别抓取物体并推荐处理方法，还能通过RAG学习新物体。

Conclusion: Octopi-1.5展示了视觉-触觉-语言模型的进展，但仍存在局限性，未来有望进一步推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper
are available at https://github.com/clear-nus/octopi-1.5.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种信任感知的游戏论车道变换决策框架（TGLD），通过动态评估人类驾驶车辆的信任水平，提升自动驾驶车辆在异构交通环境中的协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要与人类驾驶车辆有效协作，但现有车道变换框架忽视了人类驾驶车辆的动态信任水平，导致行为预测不准确。

Method: 提出TGLD框架，包括多车辆联盟游戏建模、实时信任评估方法，以及考虑社会兼容性目标的策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，TGLD能根据人类驾驶车辆的信任水平和驾驶风格调整策略，显著提升车道变换效率、安全性和交互透明度。

Conclusion: TGLD框架为自动驾驶车辆提供了更适应人类驾驶行为的车道变换策略，增强了异构交通环境中的协作能力。

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

Method: 使用GPT-4 Turbo驱动的NPC进行VR审讯模拟，通过用户研究评估系统性能（SUS、GEQ、Believability问卷）和延迟测量。

Result: 平均延迟7秒，真实感评分6.67/10，SUS得分79.44，显示系统可用性良好但需优化。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能提升NPC的真实感，但需解决延迟和情感深度问题以实现更沉浸的虚拟体验。

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the
realism and interactivity of non-player characters (NPCs) in virtual reality
(VR), creating more engaging and believable user experiences. This paper
evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their
perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features
two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage
participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A
user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability
Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent
Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text
(STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency.
Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the
increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with
high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate
scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44,
indicating good usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of large
language models to improve NPC realism and interaction in VR while highlighting
challenges in reducing system latency and enhancing emotional depth. This
research contributes to the development of more sophisticated AI-driven NPCs,
revealing the need for performance optimization to achieve increasingly
immersive virtual experiences.

Result: 通过模拟医患对话验证了系统的有效性，但也发现了挑战，为下一步工作指明了方向。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的实时数据检索系统在决策对话中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and
make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive
historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it
infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information.
This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant
past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data?
To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking
doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously
listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested
solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating
concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language
Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada
datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample
doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting
directions for the next steps of our work.

Result: 评估显示CoA在编程提示工作流中提供了更高的创作控制和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoA框架成功恢复了编程核心功能，同时保持了自然语言的灵活性，适用于非程序员如教育工作者。

Abstract: Programming-by-prompting with generative AI offers a new paradigm for
end-user programming, shifting the focus from syntactic fluency to semantic
intent. This shift holds particular promise for non-programmers such as
educators, who can describe instructional goals in natural language to generate
interactive learning content. Yet in bypassing direct code authoring, many of
programming's core affordances - such as traceability, stepwise refinement, and
behavioral testing - are lost. We propose the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA)
framework as a way to recover these affordances while preserving the expressive
flexibility of natural language. CoA decomposes the synthesis process into a
sequence of cognitively meaningful, task-aligned representations that function
as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement. We instantiate
this approach in SimStep, an authoring environment for teachers that scaffolds
simulation creation through four intermediate abstractions: Concept Graph,
Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, and UI Interaction Graph. To address
ambiguities and misalignments, SimStep includes an inverse correction process
that surfaces in-filled model assumptions and enables targeted revision without
requiring users to manipulate code. Evaluations with educators show that CoA
enables greater authoring control and interpretability in
programming-by-prompting workflows.

Abstract: Our society increasingly depends on intelligent systems to solve complex
problems, ranging from recommender systems suggesting the next movie to watch
to AI models assisting in medical diagnoses for hospitalized patients. With the
iterative improvement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI holds
significant potential to mitigate medical misdiagnoses by preventing numerous
deaths and reducing an economic burden of approximately 450 EUR billion
annually. However, a key obstacle to AI adoption lies in the lack of
transparency: many automated systems function as "black boxes," providing
predictions without revealing the underlying processes. This opacity can hinder
experts' ability to trust and rely on AI systems. Visual analytics (VA)
provides a compelling solution by combining AI models with interactive
visualizations. These specialized charts and graphs empower users to
incorporate their domain expertise to refine and improve the models, bridging
the gap between AI and human understanding. In this work, we define,
categorize, and explore how VA solutions can foster trust across the stages of
a typical AI pipeline. We propose a design space for innovative visualizations
and present an overview of our previously developed VA dashboards, which
support critical tasks within the various pipeline stages, including data
processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, understanding,
debugging, refining, and comparing models.

Result: 实验表明，M1-Parallel在保持准确性的同时速度提升2.2倍，任务完成率也有所提高。

Conclusion: 并行执行计划可优化多代理系统，适用于高复杂度推理任务。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated
remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into
subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite
their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world
problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To
address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently
runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths.
By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging,
M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to
either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our
experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination
achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that
M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further
investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe
no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings
underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent
systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 训练单一灵活的领导者可有效提升多智能体LLM系统的协作推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on a wide range
of complex reasoning tasks, yet further gains are often possible by leveraging
the complementary strengths of multiple models. While multi-agent frameworks
can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are
often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this
work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these
challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of
untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy
\textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to
evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or
explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance
not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy
improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team.
Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our
framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent
and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in
multi-agent LLM systems.

Conclusion: TinyTroupe不仅是一个具体实现，还是一种可应用于其他场景的新颖概念贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to a new class of
autonomous agents, renewing and expanding interest in the area. LLM-powered
Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation
purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its
distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS
libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population
sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among
other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social
simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this
work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona
definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs,
behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This
allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical
interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means
for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative
working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby
simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided,
highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though
realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual
contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts.
The library is available as open source at

TL;DR: 大型人口模型（LPMs）通过模拟大规模自主代理的集体行为，帮助理解复杂社会系统，结合计算、数学和隐私保护技术，为政策和社会创新提供测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社会挑战（如疫情应对、供应链中断和气候适应）需要理解大规模自主代理的集体行为，而传统模型难以满足这一需求。

Method: LPMs采用高效计算模拟百万级代理、数学框架学习现实数据流，以及隐私保护通信协议，实现虚拟与物理环境的结合。

Result: LPMs能够观察代理行为如何聚合为系统级结果，并在现实实施前测试干预措施。

Conclusion: LPMs为AI研究提供新路径，通过模拟“数字社会”揭示集体智能，并为政策和社会创新提供测试平台。

Abstract: Many of society's most pressing challenges, from pandemic response to supply
chain disruptions to climate adaptation, emerge from the collective behavior of
millions of autonomous agents making decisions over time. Large Population
Models (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by
simulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at
unprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three
key innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of
agents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse
real-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that
bridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe
how agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions
before real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on
creating "digital humans" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs
develop "digital societies" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent
phenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics,
LPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective
intelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations
before real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some
open problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework
(github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch)

TL;DR: 论文研究了模拟AI代理（大型语言模型，LLM）在拍卖中的行为，提出了一种新的合成数据生成方法，以促进拍卖研究和设计。研究发现，具备链式思维推理能力的LLM与实验文献中的拍卖结果一致，表现出类似风险厌恶人类竞标者的行为，且在策略明显透明的拍卖中更接近理论预测，但在共同价值情境下会陷入赢家诅咒。提示方面，LLM对简单提示变化不敏感，但通过正确心理模型（如纳什偏差语言）可显著改进。实验以低成本运行大量拍卖，并开发了灵活框架，为LLM代理的使用提供了概念验证。


<details>

Motivation: 研究LLM在拍卖中的行为，探索其作为人类竞标者代理的潜力，降低实验成本并推动拍卖设计研究。

Method: 引入合成数据生成过程，运行1000+次拍卖实验，使用GPT-4模型，分析LLM在不同拍卖格式中的表现，并测试提示敏感性。

Result: LLM表现出与风险厌恶人类竞标者一致的行为，在策略透明拍卖中接近理论预测，但在共同价值情境下易受赢家诅咒影响。提示优化可显著提升表现。

Conclusion: LLM可作为低成本拍卖研究代理，其行为与人类竞标者相似，提示优化是关键。研究为未来拍卖实验提供了灵活框架和概念验证。

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of simulated AI agents (large language
models, or LLMs) in auctions, introducing a novel synthetic data-generating
process to help facilitate the study and design of auctions. We find that LLMs
-- when endowed with chain of thought reasoning capacity -- agree with the
experimental literature in auctions across a variety of classic auction
formats. In particular, we find that LLM bidders produce results consistent
with risk-averse human bidders; that they perform closer to theoretical
predictions in obviously strategy-proof auctions; and, that they succumb to the
winner's curse in common value settings. On prompting, we find that LLMs are
not very sensitive to naive changes in prompts (e.g., language, currency) but
can improve dramatically towards theoretical predictions with the right mental
model (i.e., the language of Nash deviations). We run 1,000$+$ auctions for
less than $\$$400 with GPT-4 models (three orders of magnitude cheaper than
modern auction experiments) and develop a framework flexible enough to run
auction experiments with any LLM model and a wide range of auction design
specifications, facilitating further experimental study by decreasing costs and
serving as a proof-of-concept for the use of LLM proxies.

Motivation: 满足神经AI建模对大规模神经影像数据的需求，通过结合现有资源扩展对人类视觉体验的建模能力。

Method: 利用THINGS的注释图像集和CNeuroMod的fMRI数据采集方法，四名参与者完成了33-36次连续识别任务，使用约4000张图像。

Result: 报告了行为学和神经影像学指标，展示了数据的高质量。

Conclusion: CNeuroMod-THINGS通过整合资源，增强了人类视觉体验建模的能力。

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets.
CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide
set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new
densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS
exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative
(THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has
developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural
and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of
large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring
hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during
controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching
and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each
completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using
approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories.
We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the
data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands
our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

TL;DR: BEAST是一个基于自监督预训练的新型框架，用于解决神经行为分析中标记数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经科学研究需要从行为角度理解大脑，但视频分析方法依赖大量标记数据，限制了研究效率。

Method: BEAST结合掩码自编码和时间对比学习，利用未标记视频数据预训练视觉Transformer。

Result: 在多种物种中，BEAST在行为特征提取、姿态估计和动作分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BEAST为标记数据稀缺的场景提供了高效且通用的行为分析工具。

Abstract: The brain can only be fully understood through the lens of the behavior it
generates -- a guiding principle in modern neuroscience research that
nevertheless presents significant technical challenges. Many studies capture
behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on
specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation
with BEAST (BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of
Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains
experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses.
BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to
effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation
across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical
neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with
neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the
single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and
versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios
where labeled data remains scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索环境条件、恐惧进化与其他奖励（如食物奖励和社会奖励）之间的关系。

Method: 开发分布式进化模拟，猎物和捕食者共同进化其先天奖励功能，并通过强化学习行为。

Result: 社会奖励对猎物生存更关键；恐惧进化依赖于社会奖励；捕食者能力影响恐惧稳定性；静止威胁下积极奖励与恐惧对立。

Conclusion: 恐惧与社会奖励在进化中复杂互动，受捕食者和威胁特性影响。

Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid
specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have
evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution
is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental
conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as
food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary
simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate
reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,
and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation
revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important
for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators
evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator
with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but
also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are
bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive
rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with
abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear
and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through
evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性和边缘设备能力有限导致的模型收敛慢和准确率下降问题。

Method: 提出FedDH动态调整模型聚合权重，FedAD通过自适应丢弃神经元优化效率。

Result: 准确率提升6.7%，效率提高2.02倍，计算成本降低15.0%。

Conclusion: FedDHAD在非IID数据下表现优异，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning approach
that enables collaborative training of a global model using multiple edge
devices. The data distributed among the edge devices is highly heterogeneous.
Thus, FL faces the challenge of data distribution and heterogeneity, where
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across edge devices
may yield in significant accuracy drop. Furthermore, the limited computation
and communication capabilities of edge devices increase the likelihood of
stragglers, thus leading to slow model convergence. In this paper, we propose
the FedDHAD FL framework, which comes with two novel methods: Dynamic
Heterogeneous model aggregation (FedDH) and Adaptive Dropout (FedAD). FedDH
dynamically adjusts the weights of each local model within the model
aggregation process based on the non-IID degree of heterogeneous data to deal
with the statistical data heterogeneity. FedAD performs neuron-adaptive
operations in response to heterogeneous devices to improve accuracy while
achieving superb efficiency. The combination of these two methods makes FedDHAD
significantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy (up to
6.7% higher), efficiency (up to 2.02 times faster), and computation cost (up to
15.0% smaller).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成语音对话比单语音合成更具挑战性，需要真实的轮换和不同的说话人音色。

Method: 模型采用说话人轮换嵌入、课程学习策略和立体声对话生成策略，并构建了OpenDialog数据集。

Result: 实验表明，ZipVoice-Dialog在可懂度、说话人轮换准确性、说话人相似性和推理速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: ZipVoice-Dialog为语音对话生成提供了高效稳定的解决方案，并公开了代码、模型和数据集。

Abstract: Generating spoken dialogue is more challenging than monologue text-to-speech
(TTS) due to the need for realistic turn-taking and distinct speaker timbres.
Existing spoken dialogue generation models, being auto-regressive, suffer from
slow and unstable inference. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
ZipVoice-Dialog, a non-autoregressive zero-shot spoken dialogue generation
model built upon flow matching. Key designs include: 1) speaker-turn embeddings
for precise speaker turn-taking; 2) a curriculum learning strategy for stable
speech-text alignment; 3) specialized strategies to enable stereo dialogue
generation. Additionally, recognizing the lack of open-source large-scale
spoken dialogue datasets, we curated OpenDialog, a 6.8k-hour spoken dialogue
dataset from in-the-wild speech data. Furthermore, we established a benchmark
to comprehensively evaluate various models. Experimental results demonstrate
that ZipVoice-Dialog achieves superior performance in intelligibility, speaker
turn-taking accuracy, speaker similarity, and inference speed. Our codes, model
checkpoints, demo samples, and the OpenDialog dataset are all publicly
available at https://github.com/k2-fsa/ZipVoice.

Motivation: 探索LLM能否像人类考官一样解释和应用二语评估描述符，以验证NLA方法的有效性。

Method: 使用开源LLM Qwen 2.5 72B，在零样本设置下评估S&I Corpus的回答，仅依赖文本信息。

Result: NLA性能接近专用语音LLM，优于BERT模型，在任务不匹配时表现突出，且具有通用性和可解释性。

Conclusion: NLA是一种有效的二语评估方法，尤其在任务不匹配时表现优异，且易于解释和推广。

Abstract: Natural language-based assessment (NLA) is an approach to second language
assessment that uses instructions - expressed in the form of can-do descriptors
- originally intended for human examiners, aiming to determine whether large
language models (LLMs) can interpret and apply them in ways comparable to human
assessment. In this work, we explore the use of such descriptors with an
open-source LLM, Qwen 2.5 72B, to assess responses from the publicly available
S&I Corpus in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that this approach -
relying solely on textual information - achieves competitive performance: while
it does not outperform state-of-the-art speech LLMs fine-tuned for the task, it
surpasses a BERT-based model trained specifically for this purpose. NLA proves
particularly effective in mismatched task settings, is generalisable to other
data types and languages, and offers greater interpretability, as it is
grounded in clearly explainable, widely applicable language descriptors.

Motivation: 扩展自回归Transformer解码器到音频生成领域，解决音频连续性的挑战。

Method: 采用令牌级扩散建模连续值令牌分布，并提出掩码下一令牌预测任务。

Result: 在AudioCaps上，FAD和KL散度分别提升20%和40%，参数更少时性能与SOTA扩散模型相当。

Conclusion: 连续值令牌建模和掩码预测任务显著提升音频生成性能，且效率更高。

Abstract: Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become
a de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable
success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm
to audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We
research audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete
tokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution
of the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant
improvements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40%
relative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a
novel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction
into the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33%
relative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B)
models, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion
models. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer
parameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.

Result: 在2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge测试集上，DPO显著提升语音质量指标，相对增益达56%。

Conclusion: DPO首次应用于SE，结合代理感知反馈，为感知对齐的SE提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work investigates speech enhancement (SE) from the perspective of
language models (LMs). We propose a novel method that leverages Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the perceptual quality of enhanced
speech. Using UTMOS, a neural MOS prediction model, as a proxy for human
ratings, our approach guides optimization toward perceptually preferred
outputs. This differs from existing LM-based SE methods that focus on
maximizing the likelihood of clean speech tokens, which may misalign with human
perception and degrade quality despite low prediction error. Experiments on the
2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge test sets demonstrate that applying DPO
to a pretrained LM-based SE model yields consistent improvements across various
speech quality metrics, with relative gains of up to 56%. To our knowledge,
this is the first application of DPO to SE and the first to incorporate proxy
perceptual feedback into LM-based SE training, pointing to a promising
direction for perceptually aligned SE.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂网络韧性研究提供了新视角，并为设计系统性崩溃预警信号提供了依据。

Abstract: Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external
perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can
swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes.
Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to
prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial
crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience
theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting
the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the
coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human
analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory
discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling
problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas.
This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory
that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation
between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering
insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses.
Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing
well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy,
significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.

Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly
complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of
literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense
academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these
parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone
process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the
cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system
designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and
preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by
specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software
validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured
communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful,
internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological
parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in
published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation
types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of
SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate
scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at:

Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian

alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into
a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among
MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent
proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically
improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild

with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed

### [310] [Principled Foundations for Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07855)
*Wenxuan Zhou,Shujian Zhang,Brice Magdalou,John Lambert,Ehsan Amid,Richard Nock,Andrew Hard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了直接偏好优化（DPO）是两种主要理论（Savage的损失函数和Doignon-Falmagne与Machina的随机选择）在机器学习偏好学习中的特定联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DPO的通用原理至关重要，因其广泛应用、当前研究热度以及许多先进变体仅覆盖了理论图谱的一小部分。

Method: 建立了Savage所有损失函数的通用联系，支持选择理论中的弃权和机器学习中的非凸目标，并免费扩展了DPO设置（如边距和长度校正）。

Result: 揭示了DPO的通用原理，帮助理解其操作方式及其变体的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过通用视角理解DPO，有助于避免陷阱并找到解决方案，推动其在多样化应用中的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

### [311] [Efficient Triple Modular Redundancy for Reliability Enhancement of DNNs Using Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08829)
*Kimia Soroush,Nastaran Shirazi,Mohsen Raji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释人工智能（XAI）的三重模块冗余（TMR）方法，用于提升深度神经网络（DNN）在比特翻转故障下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，DNN的可靠性至关重要。TMR虽能提升可靠性，但其开销较大，需选择性应用。

Method: 利用低成本的梯度基XAI技术（LRP）计算DNN参数的重要性分数，选择关键权重进行TMR保护。

Result: 在AlexNet模型上，该方法在比特错误率为10-4时，可靠性提升超过60%，且开销与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: XAI辅助的TMR方法能高效提升DNN的可靠性，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains,
where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of
bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is
applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest
contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection
criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an
efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip
faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can
provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and
weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection
metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost,
gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to
enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being
protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16
and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate
that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4,
achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead
as state-of-the-art methods.

### [312] [LoRA Is Slower Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08833)
*Seokmin Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA是一种广泛用于微调大语言模型的技术，通过引入少量可训练的低秩权重矩阵减少参数更新量，但速度提升不一致。本文分析其性能并提出更高效的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在不同模型架构和训练设置中速度提升不一致，需探究其限制因素。

Method: 分析LoRA性能并提出改进方法，进行实证评估。

Result: 新方法在性能相当或更优的同时，提供更一致的训练速度提升。

Conclusion: 为资源受限下优化LLM微调提供实用指南。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of
trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of
parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory
consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However,
we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across
all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the
underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose
several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate
these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach
achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent
training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical
guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource
constraints.

### [313] [Representation learning with a transformer by contrastive learning for money laundering detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08835)
*Harold Guéneau,Alain Celisse,Pascal Delange*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer神经网络的洗钱检测新方法，结合对比学习和双阈值控制假阳性率，效果优于基于规则或LSTM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决洗钱检测问题，减少对领域专家监督的依赖，并控制假阳性率。

Method: 1. 通过对比学习无监督学习时间序列表示；2. 利用这些表示生成洗钱评分；3. 采用双阈值和BH程序控制假阳性率。

Result: Transformer能有效捕捉洗钱模式，检测非欺诈者和欺诈者能力更强，假阳性率可控。

Conclusion: 新方法在洗钱检测中表现优异，优于传统规则或LSTM方法。

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new
procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both
qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The
first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series
through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages
these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all
observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a
controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general
representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with
minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability
of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while
keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with
rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

### [314] [wd1: Weighted Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08838)
*Xiaohang Tang,Rares Dolga,Sangwoong Yoon,Ilija Bogunovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models
(dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The
intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the
current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization
step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to
potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the
denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that
reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single
approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on
widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL
methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers
additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer
function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with
the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT),
position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying
RL to dLLMs reasoning.

### [315] [Domain-Adaptive Diagnosis of Lewy Body Disease with Transferability Aware Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08839)
*Xiaowei Yu,Jing Zhang,Tong Chen,Yan Zhuang,Minheng Chen,Chao Cao,Yanjun Lyu,Lu Zhang,Li Su,Tianming Liu,Dajiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的转移感知Transformer（TAT），利用阿尔茨海默病（AD）数据增强路易体病（LBD）的诊断，解决了数据稀缺和领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路易体病（LBD）是一种常见但研究不足的痴呆症，诊断面临数据稀缺和领域偏移的挑战，而AD数据较为丰富，可用于知识迁移。

Method: 使用结构MRI提取的结构连接性（SC）作为训练数据，通过TAT自适应分配权重，强调疾病可转移特征，抑制领域特异性特征。

Result: 实验证明TAT能有效减少领域偏移，提高LBD诊断准确性。

Conclusion: TAT首次探索了在数据稀缺和领域偏移条件下从AD到LBD的领域适应，为罕见疾病的诊断提供了新框架。

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that
imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal
cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD
diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In
contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge
transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites
using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.
To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a
Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to
enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived
from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT
adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while
suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving
diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity
and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis
of rare diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为WRCor的无训练代理方法，用于加速神经架构搜索（NAS），通过响应相关性矩阵评估架构的表达性和泛化性，实验证明其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本NAS方法的有效性、稳定性和通用性不足，且架构评估计算成本高。

Method: 使用加权响应相关性（WRCor）作为训练免费代理，通过响应相关性矩阵计算代理分数。

Result: WRCor及其投票代理在代理评估中表现更高效，NAS算法在不同搜索空间中优于现有方法，ImageNet-1k数据集上测试错误率为22.1%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: WRCor是一种高效、稳定的零样本NAS代理方法，显著提升了架构搜索的速度和性能。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at
https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

### [317] [Gradients as an Action: Towards Communication-Efficient Federated Recommender Systems via Adaptive Action Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08842)
*Zhufeng Lu,Chentao Jia,Ming Hu,Xiaofei Xie,Mingsong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRAS是一个通信高效的联邦推荐系统框架，通过动作共享策略减少通信开销，同时保持推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦推荐系统中通信开销高和训练效率低的问题。

Method: 采用动作共享策略，将梯度聚类为有限的动作进行通信，并动态调整动作数量以适应异构环境。

Result: 通信负载减少高达96.88%，且不影响推荐性能。

Conclusion: FedRAS在减少通信开销的同时，保持了推荐系统的性能，适用于异构环境。

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated
Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender
systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from
two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive
item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low
training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network
environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ
various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the
parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from
model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,
this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,
which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item
embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication
rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud
server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since
gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining
the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors
compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.
To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS
incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the
number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate
that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,
while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous
scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at
https://github.com/mastlab-T3S/FedRAS.

*Irfan Ullah,Young-Koo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态自适应扇出优化采样器（DAFOS），通过动态调整扇出和优先处理重要节点，显著提升了GNN的训练速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN中的均匀邻居采样和静态扇出设置限制了模型的扩展性和效率，需要一种更灵活的方法来优化训练过程。

Method: DAFOS基于节点度对节点评分，动态调整扇出，并集成早停机制，以在性能提升有限时停止训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DAFOS实现了显著的训练速度提升（最高12.6倍）和准确性提升（F1分数提高2.38%-3.1%）。

Conclusion: DAFOS是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于大规模GNN训练。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from
graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout
settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we
propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel
approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and
prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node
scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally
important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses.
DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when
performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets,
ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a
state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv
dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score
from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the
ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of
DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

*Calum Corrie Imrie,Ioannis Stefanakos,Sepeedeh Shahbeigi,Richard Hawkins,Simon Burton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AMLAS-RL的框架，用于为强化学习（RL）系统生成安全保证论证，解决了现有方法在RL生命周期中缺乏系统性保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在物理信息系统（CPS）中的广泛应用，强化学习因其适应复杂动态环境的能力而受到青睐，但其在安全关键应用中的安全性仍需系统性保证。

Method: 论文通过迭代过程将AMLAS方法适配到RL领域，提出了AMLAS-RL框架，并以轮式车辆避障任务为例进行演示。

Result: AMLAS-RL框架能够为RL系统生成安全保证论证，填补了现有方法在RL生命周期中的系统性保证空白。

Conclusion: AMLAS-RL为RL系统的安全性提供了系统性保证，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing
integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS
offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant
safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning
(RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex,
dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and
environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in
safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective
but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating
safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic
assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured
guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does
not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we
adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an
RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate
AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a
target goal without collision.

TL;DR: 比较时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）与传统方法在共形预测中的表现，发现TSFMs在数据有限时提供更可靠的预测区间和更稳定的校准过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在时间序列预测中的零样本能力，特别是在共形预测中的潜力。

Method: 在共形预测框架下，比较TSFMs与传统统计模型和梯度提升方法的性能。

Result: TSFMs在数据有限时表现更优，预测区间更可靠，校准过程更稳定。

Conclusion: 基础模型在数据受限的时间序列应用中能显著提升共形预测的可靠性。

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series
forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the
available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the
performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods,
including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal
prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First,
when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized
prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive
accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are
used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced
these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data
for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation
models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series
applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce
the experiments is available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的旅行需求建模框架，结合人口合成、活动生成和微观交通模拟，显著降低了建模成本并提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于活动的模型（ABMs）依赖简化假设，开发成本高且难以跨区域适应，需要更高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 框架整合人口合成、协调活动生成、位置分配和大规模微观交通模拟，生成基于家庭社会人口特征的日常活动模式。

Result: 在洛杉矶的验证中，模型与真实出行模式高度吻合，性能接近传统ABMs，但成本更低、可扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 该框架为旅行需求建模提供了高效、可扩展且可迁移的解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility
system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in
behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are
costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper
presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes
household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's
socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population
synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and
large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully
generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A
full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million
population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates
real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with
significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to
the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine
similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network
yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans
PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001
JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于神经网络的语义通信需要联合训练的问题，并优化无线网络中的噪声和资源分配。

Method: 利用CLIP模型提取语义信息，结合PPO算法优化模型架构和频谱资源分配。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法收敛速度提升40%，累积奖励提高4倍。

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义通信框架在无线网络中表现优异，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model
based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural
network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and
decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model
based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a
transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural
network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for
follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.
Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework
over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the
CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic
information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP
model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize
semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay
and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a
proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus
finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that
our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the
accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ODIA的新方法，通过在线用户交互数据加速LLM的函数调用，显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM函数调用的高延迟影响用户体验，需要一种高效的方法来优化。

Method: 利用在线用户数据识别“简单查询”，并通过知识蒸馏将大模型的知识迁移到小模型。

Result: 响应延迟降低45%（预期）和78%（中位数），小模型成功处理60%流量且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ODIA是一种实用且自动化的解决方案，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high
latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user
experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation
for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to
accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from
production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones,
our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while
maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model
successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method
requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated
data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for
production environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于哈密顿蒙特卡洛（HMC）采样的深度神经网络（DNN）概率最后一层方法（LL-HMC），以降低计算成本并适用于大规模数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC虽为不确定性估计的金标准，但其计算需求限制了在大规模数据和大型DNN中的应用。LL-HMC通过仅对最后一层采样，解决了这一问题。

Method: LL-HMC将HMC采样限制在DNN的最后一层，减少了计算量。论文将其与五种概率深度学习方法（LL-PDL）在三个真实视频数据集上进行了比较。

Result: LL-HMC在分布内分类和分布外（OOD）检测中表现优异，但额外采样参数仅提升OOD检测，对分类性能无显著改善。

Conclusion: LL-HMC是一种高效的概率最后一层方法，适用于计算资源有限的场景，尤其在OOD检测方面表现突出。

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a
probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is
widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the
computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large
DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can
be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number
of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the
required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a
DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited
computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last
layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world
video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution
classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we
performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant
on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results
show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD
detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve
the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple
chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Fair-FLIP的后处理方法，用于减少深度伪造检测中的偏见，同时保持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测方法虽然性能高，但存在对种族和性别等人口属性的偏见，威胁公众信任。

Method: 提出Fair-FLIP方法，通过重新加权模型最后一层的输入，减少子群体差异。

Result: 实验显示，Fair-FLIP可将公平性指标提升30%，同时基线准确率仅下降0.25%。

Conclusion: Fair-FLIP在保持检测性能的同时，有效减少了深度伪造检测中的偏见。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular,
yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to
public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high
predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes
such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair
deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust
detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing
approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising
(Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce
subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting
highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the
baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches
show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining
baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

TL;DR: 论文分析了离散扩散模型中无分类器引导（CFG）的作用，发现早期高引导会降低生成质量，而晚期引导影响更大。提出了一种改进方法，通过简单代码调整提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究离散扩散模型中无分类器引导（CFG）的机制，特别是引导调度对生成质量的影响。

Method: 理论分析CFG在掩码离散扩散中的作用，提出一种改进的引导机制，平滑数据分布与初始分布之间的传输。

Result: 实验证明改进方法在ImageNet和QM9数据集上有效提升了样本质量。

Conclusion: 早期高引导有害，晚期引导更有效；改进的CFG机制简单且有效。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional
generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and
recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically
analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role
of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling
(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage
guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation
for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The
analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These
implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as
unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the
quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the
analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically
applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the
transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform)
distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method
is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is
empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete
diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

Result: DualBind在基准测试中表现优异，展示了机器学习以低成本近似AB-FEP的潜力。

Conclusion: ToxBench和DualBind为药物发现中的高效结合亲和力预测提供了新工具。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery
and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate
predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data.
In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy
perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive
for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench,
the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on
a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha
(ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with
binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against
experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping
ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further
benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind
model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding
energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of
DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the
computational cost.

Result: PINNs准确再现了湍流的关键统计量，如能量谱、动能、涡度和雷诺应力。

Conclusion: 神经方程求解器能处理复杂混沌系统，为超越传统计算限制的湍流建模开辟新途径。

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems
in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive
at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a
radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical
equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free
solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic
systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that
transcends traditional computational limitations.

Conclusion: SGNNs将科学理论与深度学习结合，提供了一种新的建模范式，增强了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer
interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine
learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer
unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce
Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses
mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are
pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter
regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across
scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved
state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly
tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield
prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological
forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also
accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social
networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as
estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods
even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution,
a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs
retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most
similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active.
This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening --
not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep
learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming
simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision,
enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256基准测试中，训练速度比SiT-XL快23.3倍，比REPA快4倍。

Conclusion: 表示引导显著提升扩散模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts
meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG),
Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on
data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting
embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation
was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code
is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The
projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across
modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident
cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were
predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals
added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with
the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance,
achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across
different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the
external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed
framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data.
The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into
clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统的评估方法存在根本性缺陷，导致性能特征被掩盖，阻碍科学进步。

Method: 通过系统分析近期系统，识别出三个关键维度的常见反模式：基线公平性、评估设置和指标设计。

Result: 揭示了这些反模式如何导致误导性结论，并提出了一个全面的检查清单以改进评估。

Conclusion: 建立了一个严格的评估方法基础，促进有意义的比较和可重复的结果，加速LLM推理系统的真正进步。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has
yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis
reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental
flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true
performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a
comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring
anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,
and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM
inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode
operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict
temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common
anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate
engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to
represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial
performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.
To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from
our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these
anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the
practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing
speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is
easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these
anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation
methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,
and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving
beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

Result: 随机块丢弃技术表现优于宽度子网络构建，内存使用减少20-40%且性能无损失。

Conclusion: 新方法在减少内存和通信成本方面具有潜力，尤其适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory
demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication
costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory
requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate
workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation
communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or
lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We
evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of
ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed
training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique
consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously
explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior
performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks
having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our
approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in
performance.

Conclusion: LoRA-MCL有效提升了语言模型生成多样且合理句子的能力。

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in
language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence
continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an
intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be
equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and
the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying
Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated
from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use
data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive
experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method
achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

Conclusion: 建议在无污染基准和多样化模型上评估RL方法，以确保结论可信。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing
major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience
and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise
and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to
as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from
the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM
(Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927
and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the
EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an
effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed
model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks
can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

Conclusion: 扩展的GPBE目标结合多步信用分配和梯度方法，显著提升了深度RL的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning
(RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient
temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are
consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like
Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely
been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman
Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear
function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods,
which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In
this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit
assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based
methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view
formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation
compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and
MinAtar environments, respectively. Code available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their
triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times,
difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature
extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods
have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale
datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential
improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the
potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both
positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with
weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and
efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance
of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive
and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically
structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more
parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a
significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

Method: POIFormer利用Transformer的自注意力机制，联合建模空间邻近性、访问时间、POI语义、用户行为和群体行为模式等多维信号。

Result: 在真实世界移动数据集上的实验表明，POIFormer在空间噪声和高密度POI聚类场景下显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: POIFormer提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，适用于多种数据源和地理环境，无需依赖难以获取的数据层。

Abstract: Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a
foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and
urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS
inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and
the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues
can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius
in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient
for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce
\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and
efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited
spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly
models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and
duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from
user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's
self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these
dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future
visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral
patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate,
efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture
supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts
while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it
practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world
mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines,
particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise
and dense POI clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolecBioNet是一个新颖的图框架，整合分子和生物医学知识，用于预测药物相互作用（DDI），表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图方法独立处理药物对，忽略了药物对的复杂上下文依赖性，且难以整合生物网络和分子结构。

Method: MolecBioNet将药物对建模为统一实体，结合宏观生物相互作用和微观分子影响，使用CASPool和AGIPool策略增强准确性和可解释性。

Result: 实验表明MolecBioNet在DDI预测中优于现有方法，验证了统一建模和多尺度知识整合的优势。

Conclusion: MolecBioNet为DDI预测提供了全面且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology,
often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for
patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved
strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,
overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.
Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction
networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic
insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework
that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable
DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet
captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular
influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework
extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs
hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging
classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of
drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces
two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling
(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and
attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential
molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information
minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and
embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair
modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于在线世界模型的持续强化学习方法（CRL），通过规划解决任务序列中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续强化学习中，智能体在学习新任务时容易遗忘旧任务（灾难性遗忘），需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用在线学习的Follow-The-Leader浅层模型捕捉世界动态，并通过模型预测控制规划任务。模型具有抗遗忘性，且理论上有遗憾界保证。

Result: 在设计的Continual Bench环境中，该方法优于基于深度世界模型和多种持续学习技术的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的FTL在线代理（OA）能持续学习新任务且不遗忘旧技能，为CRL提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where
an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks
that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that
the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task,
known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this
challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a
Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which
we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any
reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by
construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$
under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest
online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally.
To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for
CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning
algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously
to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built
on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Conclusion: XiChen展示了完全由AI驱动的天气预报系统的潜力，无需依赖传统数值天气预报系统。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant
potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models
rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition
preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce
XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather
forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to
medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is
built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting.
Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation
operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw
satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional
variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting
accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful
forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that
XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting
independent of NWP systems.

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了基于补丁的PDE代理模型中推理时补丁大小可调性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major
limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two
lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator
(CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size
control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy
loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch
artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks.
Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach
improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based
PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across
architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling
in PDE surrogate tasks.

Method: 引入通用框架，量化不确定性并选择性填补高置信度值。

Result: 在多种EHR数据集上实验显示，选择性填补减少误差并提升下游任务（如24小时死亡率预测）。

Conclusion: 将不确定性纳入时间序列填补具有实际价值，能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains.
Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor
disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is
critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack
mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general
framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation.
By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable
imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering
diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing
less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves
downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour
mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating
uncertainty into time series imputation.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations
between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations.
As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention.
However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream
classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA
method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are
independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without
compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating
its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving
fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in
neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential.

Conclusion: 该研究为AI安全提供了新工具，并提出了未来在大型模型上的实证研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent
deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit
critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a
novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching
as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in
transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and
patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate
vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network
simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we
demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from
a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We
propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation
in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review
synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial
attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust
fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research
directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use
potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

Conclusion: DyCAST-Net在复杂动态环境中表现出色，其架构设计确保可扩展性和适应性，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is
essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and
marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional
analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal
Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel
architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated
temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net
effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated
convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its
attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy
and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens
robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference
reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets
demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as
TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation
of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in
noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,
uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising
on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial
markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent
mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in
high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by
RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability
across diverse application domains

Motivation: 探索变压器在ICL中的学习机制，揭示其为何能在无梯度更新的情况下完成任务。

Method: 通过合成线性回归任务和分布外泛化实验，分析变压器的ICL行为，并进行频谱分析。

Result: 变压器在分布外数据上泛化能力差，且其行为与OLS等算法不符；频谱分析揭示了训练数据分布对ICL行为的影响。

Conclusion: 变压器的ICL能力依赖于训练数据的分布，其行为并非通过实现传统学习算法完成。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example
input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success,
the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study
synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at
inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the
performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers
through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we
demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments
that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt
distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers
implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the
pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the
learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same
distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique
spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two
singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution
inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly
correlated with low loss.

Result: 在多种真实数据集上验证了FBM方法在长短期预测任务中的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FBM方法有效解决了现有傅里叶方法的局限性，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for
time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis
functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the
frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine
basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing
Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series
length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and
overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping
(FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features
through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our
approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal
characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of
neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better
performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear,
MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model
architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and
interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model
time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several
techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking,
centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale
down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for
both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic
assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address
this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of
decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with
continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model
paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental
fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and
ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort
homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with
transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32
contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting
the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention
interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models
(mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns,
outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though
linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models
(mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity
profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting
patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation,
while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories
suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and
pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific
homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS
progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor
monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment
in future multi-center studies.

Method: 分析QV-learning和AV-learning的收敛性和样本效率，并引入新算法Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ)。

Result: AV-learning在控制任务中优于Q-learning；RDQ在MinAtar基准测试中显著优于Dueling DQN。

Conclusion: AV-learning方法在控制任务中具有优势，RDQ算法表现优异。

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping:
using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of
TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single
action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less
attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value
functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in
learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as
either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been
investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is
advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether
such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze
these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We
find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the
prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over
Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning
algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly
outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦遗忘中的隐私风险，并提出了解决方案，推动了联邦遗忘系统在实际应用中的安全性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving
data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow
clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy
concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process
can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce
DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after
unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced
version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve
reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and
DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our
work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and
offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning
systems in real-world applications.

Method: 使用AES加密的MNIST数据集，测试$p$-value和$e$-value的CP方法在加密数据上的表现。

Result: 加密数据模型测试准确率36.88%，$e$-value CP覆盖率达60%，$p$-value CP覆盖精度较低。

Conclusion: CP在加密数据中具有潜力，但需权衡预测集紧凑性与可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) with supervised
learning on deterministically encrypted data, aiming to bridge the gap between
rigorous uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving machine learning.
Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP
methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain,
owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption.
We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal
predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on
deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful
structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random
guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover,
$e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3
loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of
5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive

*Md Mushfiqur Rahaman,Elliot Chang,Tasmiah Haque,Srinjoy Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了生成式和判别式LSTM文本分类模型在边缘计算中的表现，重点研究了后训练量化（PTQ）对模型性能的影响，特别是生成式模型对量化位宽、校准数据和输入噪声的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中的文本分类需要低延迟和高准确性，生成式分类器对分布外和噪声数据具有鲁棒性，但部署时面临计算和内存限制。PTQ可减少模型大小和计算成本，但其对生成式和判别式模型的影响尚不明确。

Method: 使用Brevitas量化库对生成式和判别式LSTM模型进行PTQ，评估不同位宽下的性能，并分析校准数据类别不平衡对权重调整和激活分布的影响。

Result: 判别式分类器表现稳健，而生成式分类器对位宽、校准数据和输入噪声更敏感。类别不平衡的校准数据会导致生成式模型在低位宽下性能下降。

Conclusion: 校准数据在PTQ中起关键作用，生成式分类器在噪声环境下的表现受校准数据分布影响显著，这对边缘部署具有指导意义。

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like
industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low
latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in
particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and
noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such
real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices
faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ)
reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for
edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of
generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text
classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We
evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess
their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while
discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to
bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized
inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for
both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly
distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and
activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from
nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data
during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths
for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This
study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative
classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统核函数（如基于指数的方法）局限性较大，无法满足复杂系统建模需求，因此需要扩展核函数类型并支持灵活组合。

Method: 提出了一种包含多种核函数（如指数平方正弦和有理二次核）及其导数的框架，并在SMT 2.0中实现。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂频率敏感领域的代理建模提供了灵活工具，支持未来更多应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing
correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of
kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques,
we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex
mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems.
Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are
extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine
and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand
second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a
sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon
Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these
advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox
(SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable
kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of
various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models
tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible
toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future
applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

Motivation: 传统物理模拟方法（如PINNs和有限差分法）需要显式数学方程，限制了其泛化能力和发现潜力。本研究旨在通过AI直接学习物理规律，实现通用模拟。

Method: 采用草图引导的扩散变换器方法，将模拟视为条件生成问题，利用空间边界条件生成物理准确的稳态解。模型通过增强的扩散变换器架构和空间关系编码实现边界到平衡的直接映射。

Result: 模型能够直接生成稳态解（SSIM > 0.8），同时保持亚像素级边界精度，避免了时间积分误差。通过LRP分析，揭示了未预设的物理关系。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从AI加速物理到AI发现物理的范式转变，建立了首个真正通用的物理模拟框架。

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical
constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics
to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics
simulation framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理监督与时空学习的新框架RGPD，用于准确估计RUL和SOH，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业应用中，准确预测剩余使用寿命（RUL）和健康状态（SOH）对设备管理至关重要，需要结合物理约束和时空学习。

Method: 使用图卷积循环网络（GCRN）和图注意力卷积（GATConv）捕捉时空特征，结合Soft Actor-Critic（SAC）模块动态优化隐藏表示，并通过Q学习动态分配物理约束权重。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上，RGPD在RUL和SOH估计任务中表现优于现有方法，具有强鲁棒性和预测准确性。

Conclusion: RGPD框架通过动态结合物理约束和时空学习，显著提升了工业设备健康管理的预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH)
is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of
industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based
Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that
combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning.
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional
filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over
time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention
mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically
weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit
(TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module
improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden
representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To
identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents
dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving
generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for
manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong
robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across
three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 混杂变量会导致虚假相关性和预测偏差，传统方法如MDN在持续学习中难以应对。

Method: 引入R-MDN层，通过递归最小二乘法动态调整特征表示，适应数据和混杂变量的变化。

Result: 实验表明R-MDN在静态学习和持续学习中均能减少混杂变量影响，提升预测公平性。

Conclusion: R-MDN是一种有效的解决方案，适用于持续学习中的混杂变量问题。

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在交通预测中，联邦学习（FL）适合协作训练模型而不共享原始数据，但标准FL方法忽略了客户端间的空间关系，而图学习方法计算开销大。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级图感知FL方法，通过基本邻域聚合原则指导参数更新，基于图连接性加权客户端模型。

Result: 在METR-LA和PEMS-BAY数据集上验证，性能优于标准基线和近期基于图的联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉空间关系且计算高效，适用于交通预测任务。

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in
specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices
deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an
individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning
(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing
raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model
updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each
client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging
(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in
traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are
important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies
during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant
computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL
approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph
learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic
neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting
client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial
relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,
and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard
baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络偏好的电路类型，为网络结构和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features
than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for
computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there
has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in
practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND
problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs.
The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is
restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called
compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple
solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully
dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit
naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency.
It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and
extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain
the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the
theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types
of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition
representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network
circuitry and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“warm-start model”的确定性模型，通过提供更好的起始点显著加速条件生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的迭代生成模型（如扩散模型和流匹配）生成高保真样本时速度较慢，通常需要数百次函数评估。

Method: 引入warm-start模型，从条件化的N(mu, sigma)先验开始生成，而非传统的N(0, I)先验，减少生成过程的距离。

Result: 在图像修复等任务中，仅需11次函数评估即可达到与1000步DDPM基线相当的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法兼容任何标准生成模型和采样器，且无需修改，可与其他高效采样技术结合进一步加速。

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at

Result: 在低资源场景显著优于现有方法，在丰富资源场景保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型兼具可训练性和可解释性，适用于多种时间序列分类任务。

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series
classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for
training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they
lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,
dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is
widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent
interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and
cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than
neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a
versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with
labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic
length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while
preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the
DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on
this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a
neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,
while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to
several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it
significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and
remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

Conclusion: 生成式诊断范式为认知诊断在人工智能中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by
analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial
machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.
Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive
prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and
extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as
they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally
expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.
In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that
fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling
inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We
propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative
Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model
(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional
methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from
response prediction through a well-designed generation process that
incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$
speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for
cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for
intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is

Conclusion: 研究主张预训练目标应编码任务异构性和时间结构，作为关系数据库预测建模的设计原则。

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of
domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning
from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity.
Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks
are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and
SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to
take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations.
By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label
generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel
information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a
novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via
set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling
next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an
information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations
retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive
experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms
traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training
objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design
principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

Conclusion: SF方法是一种实用、可扩展且理论支持的语言模型训练方案，适用于持续扩展的训练任务。

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional
pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate
schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent
alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight
averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay
phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at
the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable
alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],
which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show
that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape
without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable
for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we
conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it
implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this
analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to
momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key
limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model
training.

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

Method: 定义任务先验和任务分布，构建概率空间下的下游任务集，评估模型在所有可能任务上的平均性能和方差。

Result: 提出了首个能够回答模型在所有可能任务上平均性能和方差的框架，为SSL研究提供了新的评估标准。

Conclusion: 任务先验框架不仅解决了当前评估的瓶颈，还将加速SSL研究的进展。

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning
(SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In
contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely
on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large
amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of
evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that
such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To
remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by
adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view,
one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream
tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as
(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream
tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the
variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the
defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we
believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where
downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have
access to.

*Huynh Nguyen Dang,Thang Pham,Ngan Le,Van Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TolerantECG是一种针对ECG信号的基础模型，能够处理噪声和部分导联缺失的情况，通过对比学习和自监督学习框架训练，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号可能因噪声或导联缺失导致诊断错误或不确定性，因此需要一种鲁棒的模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 结合对比学习和自监督学习框架，训练模型学习ECG信号表示及其文本报告描述，同时处理噪声和导联缺失信号。

Result: 在PTB-XL和MIT-BIH数据集上表现优异，通常排名第一或第二。

Conclusion: TolerantECG是一种有效的解决方案，能够提升ECG信号分析的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing
heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or
unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings,
resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise
and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG.
TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning
frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their
corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted
or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that
TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across
various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and
achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

*Huibo Xu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Haoning Dang,Chun-Wun Cheng,Angelica I Aviles-Rivero,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出NeuTSFlow框架，通过神经算子学习连续函数族间的转换路径，解决时间序列预测中离散观测与连续函数关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将时间序列视为离散序列，忽略了其作为连续过程噪声采样的本质。论文提出从函数族的角度重新定义预测任务。

Method: 提出NeuTSFlow框架，利用神经算子进行流匹配，参数化无限维函数空间中的速度场，直接建模函数级特征。

Result: 在多种预测任务中，NeuTSFlow表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 函数族视角有效，NeuTSFlow为时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet
conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their
origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy
observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they
correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can
be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a
shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as
learning the transition from the historical function family to the future
function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we
leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships
between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the
transition path in function space from the historical function family to the
future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a
novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for
learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By
parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function
spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies
at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.
Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior
accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family
perspective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为scSGC的软图聚类方法，用于解决单细胞RNA测序数据中硬图构建的局限性，通过非二值边权重更准确地表征细胞间的连续相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的单细胞RNA测序聚类方法（如图神经网络）依赖硬图构建，导致信息丢失和聚类偏差，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: scSGC框架包括三个核心组件：基于零膨胀负二项分布的特征自编码器、双通道切割信息软图嵌入模块和基于最优传输的聚类优化模块。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验表明，scSGC在聚类准确性、细胞类型注释和计算效率上优于13种最先进的聚类模型。

Conclusion: scSGC在单细胞RNA测序数据分析中具有显著潜力，有助于更深入地理解细胞异质性。

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent
graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks
(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of
high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to
ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph
constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents
challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary
edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of
continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information
loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard
graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,
potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering
outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph
Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately
characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge
weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC
framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative
binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed
soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering
optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that
scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,
cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its
substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our
understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如核工程）中部署LLM需要理解其内部推理过程，以满足核监管框架对AI透明度和验证的要求。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术（Low-Rank Adaptation）对通用LLM进行核领域适配，通过神经元激活模式比较和神经元沉默技术分析特定神经元的作用。

Result: 沉默单个神经元影响不显著，但沉默整个神经元组会显著降低任务性能，且模型生成技术信息的准确性受损。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强黑盒模型的透明度提供了具体路径，有助于实现核级AI保障，满足监管要求。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains,
such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their
internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for
interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a
Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM
(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation
patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a
sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the
adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we
employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while
silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a
statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively
led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative
analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's
ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This
paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an
opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable
neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade
artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and
validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR
50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear
operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出MemSinks方法，通过设计隔离记忆机制，解决大语言模型记忆重复序列的隐私和版权问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型容易记忆重复序列，引发隐私和版权担忧，现有后处理方法效果有限。

Method: 提出MemSinks范式，利用序列标识符激活特定记忆神经元，实现记忆内容的隔离。

Result: 在十亿参数和十亿标记规模下，MemSinks实现了有效隔离和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemSinks首次证明在真实数据上同时实现泛化和记忆隔离的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,
posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to
remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such
approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show
that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically
plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language
abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we
put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization
by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of
memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the
dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates
isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising
general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter
and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong
generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real
data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is
achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLA是一种自监督学习策略，用于在线持续学习，通过对齐当前与过去的表征以减少遗忘，并加速训练收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在在线持续学习（数据以小批量到达、计算预算固定且无任务边界）中应用较少，需要一种新策略来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Continual Latent Alignment (CLA)，通过对齐当前模型与过去学习的表征来减少遗忘。

Result: CLA在在线场景中加速训练收敛，并在相同计算预算下优于现有方法；作为预训练协议时，其早期表现优于全独立同分布预训练。

Conclusion: CLA是一种有效的在线持续学习自监督策略，兼具训练效率和最终性能优势。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in
reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from
suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about
importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a
variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance
reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the
distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under
general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We
theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order
stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an
additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the
expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the
horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent
sample complexity.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅预测性能优越，还通过SHAP分析提升可解释性，适用于可持续能源应用。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing
sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of
renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a
neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet
transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of
time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the
Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections
to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through
wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly
captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated
across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity
transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this
architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various
forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal
dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP
analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and
enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents.
Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace
representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate
the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain
abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM
autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level
play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a
meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space,
reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent
space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within
studied AI players.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and
improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for
cognitive assessment but have traditionally relied on manual scoring. Automatic
dementia classification (ADC) systems aim to infer cognitive decline directly
from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework
based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation
with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments
administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were
diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms
prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using
fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that
our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models,
paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

Conclusion: FedFD通过特征蒸馏和正交投影，有效提升了异构联邦学习的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing
attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models
while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,
ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often
employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global
model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not
always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The
reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,
while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for
the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous
Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature
information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous
models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge
distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to
maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align
the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize
the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and
thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 准确的需求预测对电商和实体零售商的供应链管理至关重要，尤其是在销售高峰期，需求峰值难以预测。

Method: TAT模型结合了先验已知的上下文变量（如节假日和促销活动信息），通过编码器和解码器以及新颖的Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA)机制，学习上下文依赖的对齐。

Result: 在两个大型电商数据集上的实验表明，TAT在峰值需求预测上提升了30%的准确性，同时整体性能与其他先进方法相当。

Conclusion: TAT模型在峰值需求预测中表现出色，为供应链管理提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as
demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying
and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical
retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons
extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales
events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately.
However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain
operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a
multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as
holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance.
Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel
Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent
alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis
on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We
demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand
forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with
performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based
on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy
consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and
FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage,
influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy
dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the
application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX
\textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher}
model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student
model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is
measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus
Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and
a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error
floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving
energy-efficient AI solutions.

Result: 研究发现VLMs存在明显短板，并对其能力、鲁棒性和视觉信息处理方式提出了重要观察。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进VLMs提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for
addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been
shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual
understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations
of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that
probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we
go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final
performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the
performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual
encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In
doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important
observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual
information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving
VLMs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a
lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build
robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop
that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across
imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We
identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity
and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of
publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building
benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological
systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data
curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open,
collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust
benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for
ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately
advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries,
therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提供紧凑且可解释的逻辑表示，性能接近翻译前的模型。

Conclusion: 解缠方法有效解决了神经DNF模型的性能退化问题，提升了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and
interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising
results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior
knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the
thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here
that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its
failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the
networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement
method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent
nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through
experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks
(including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our
disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical
representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to
that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at

Result: 单个方法无法满足法规和实际需求，因此提出了一种多层次策略，结合现有方法的优势。

Conclusion: 多层次策略通过简单评分机制实现可扩展性和实用性，同时适应不同类型的深度伪造技术和上下文风险权重。

Abstract: The growing availability and use of deepfake technologies increases risks for
democratic societies, e.g., for political communication on online platforms.
The EU has responded with transparency obligations for providers and deployers
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and online platforms. This includes
marking deepfakes during generation and labeling deepfakes when they are
shared. However, the lack of industry and enforcement standards poses an
ongoing challenge. Through a multivocal literature review, we summarize methods
for marking, detecting, and labeling deepfakes and assess their effectiveness
under EU regulation. Our results indicate that individual methods fail to meet
regulatory and practical requirements. Therefore, we propose a multi-level
strategy combining the strengths of existing methods. To account for the masses
of content on online platforms, our multi-level strategy provides scalability
and practicality via a simple scoring mechanism. At the same time, it is
agnostic to types of deepfake technology and allows for context-specific risk
weighting.

Method: 通过分析2023-2025年LLM司法应用数据，提出DTDMR-LJGF框架，实现智能任务分类和多利益相关者互动。

Result: 研究发现LLM技术一致性具有正负双重影响，需从任务和利益相关者两个维度解决分歧。

Conclusion: DTDMR-LJGF框架为平衡技术效率与社会合法性提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) technology into judicial
systems is fundamentally transforming legal practice worldwide. However, this
global transformation has revealed an urgent paradox requiring immediate
attention. This study introduces the concept of ``consistency-acceptability
divergence'' for the first time, referring to the gap between technical
consistency and social acceptance. While LLMs achieve high consistency at the
technical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative
effects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial
applications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge
requires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study
proposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance
Framework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and
meaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders. This framework offers both
theoretical insights and practical guidance for building an LLM judicial
ecosystem that balances technical efficiency with social legitimacy.

Result: Dice分数比基线模型提高了4.1%，分割精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能可靠地提取椎骨轮廓，为脊柱活动性疾病的评估和手术规划提供支持。

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring
vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring
variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring
plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is
traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it
labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular,
mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra,
which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods
provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification,
segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time
consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to
accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray
images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with
dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared
to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring
reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality,
realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can
mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research,
and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a
combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR)
for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former
generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then
processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X
512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global
relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results
demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and
synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for
real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a
diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100
synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy
in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding

<details>

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络和简单特征拼接方法在多模态数据融合中效果不佳，无法充分利用互补信息且易丢失关键信息。

Method: 采用不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制，融合脑PET、MRI、基因数据和临床数据等多模态信息。

Conclusion: 不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制能有效捕捉多模态数据间的关键交互特征，显著提升AD诊断性能。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease
characterized by progressive cognitive decline as its main symptom. In the
research field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional
convolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to
effectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and
the simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key
information during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the
development of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for
solving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical
professionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as
brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the
presence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).
The innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal
cross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information
features of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper
compares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the
traditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning
models for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric
cross-modal cross-attention mechanism. The algorithm model achieves an accuracy
of 94.88% on the test set.

Motivation: 胸部CT在呼吸困难患者中的应用增加，但放射科医师短缺导致报告延迟，AI可作为辅助工具提高诊断精度。

Method: 采用Boosted Trees模型，基于急性胸部CT扫描中分割的心脏和肺部结构测量数据预测AHF，使用Shapley Additive解释模型预测。

Result: 模型在独立测试集上ROC曲线下面积为0.87，误分类分析显示部分错误源于初始放射学报告的不准确。

Conclusion: 开发的AI模型具有强区分性能，透明化的预测步骤可辅助决策。

Abstract: Introduction: Chest CT scans are increasingly used in dyspneic patients where
acute heart failure (AHF) is a key differential diagnosis. Interpretation
remains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a
radiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency
physicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can
be a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop
an explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an
accuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.
  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen
University Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees
model was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and
pulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for
training and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were
segmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used
to explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.
  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated
twelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the
independent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications
found that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false
negatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating
from inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.
  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory
performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists. The AI model's stepwise,
transparent predictions may support decision-making.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的广泛应用，用户隐私问题日益突出，尤其是模型可能无意中处理或暴露私人视觉信息。

Method: 将隐私保护问题建模为对抗攻击问题，提出一种选择性隐藏ROIs的攻击策略，避免破坏图像整体语义。

Result: 在三种先进VLMs（LLaVA、Instruct-BLIP和BLIP2-T5）上实验显示，目标ROIs的检测率降低高达98%，同时保持全局图像语义不变。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态模型的隐私保护提供了实用工具，并推动了隐私意识的提升。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These
models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread
adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious
concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process
or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation
of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack
strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of
Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing
sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining
image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire
image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental
results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and
BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while
maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity
scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work
contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a
practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin

explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional
approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our method navigates the
perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic
sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises
three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded
Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction
sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

Result: 在训练效率和重建质量上均有显著提升，优于传统和现代方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为相位检索提供了高效且有效的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only
measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical
computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several
well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers,
the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and
measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained
traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant
theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a
novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework
called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced
initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the
Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel
acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively
refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline.
Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation
techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared
to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential
for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

Abstract: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for
different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper
investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying
bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity
through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested
under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and
EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared.
These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were
progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies
how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained
models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of
the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges
experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper
establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using
transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide
practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep

Motivation: 地球观测中空间和时间分辨率的权衡是关键问题，尤其是温度数据的高分辨率需求。现有技术无法同时满足高时空分辨率，且受云层影响。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络，结合年度温度周期和线性项，将粗分辨率的地球系统模型输出放大为卫星观测的细尺度温度值。

Result: 通过GOES-16和Landsat数据验证，框架在四种数据集上实现了有效的温度重建。

Conclusion: 该框架为全球范围内、全天候的高分辨率温度数据生成提供了新可能。

Abstract: Central to Earth observation is the trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. For temperature, this is especially critical because real-world
applications require high spatiotemporal resolution data. Current technology
allows for hourly temperature observations at 2 km, but only every 16 days at
100 m, a gap further exacerbated by cloud cover. Earth system models offer
continuous hourly temperature data, but at a much coarser spatial resolution
(9-31 km). Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for
temperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources. The
proposed framework uses a convolutional neural network that incorporates the
annual temperature cycle and includes a linear term to amplify the coarse Earth
system model output into fine-scale temperature values observed from
satellites. We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16
(2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective
temperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.
This physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for
generating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales,
under all weather conditions and globally.

included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC.
U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice:
0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for
non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For
classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid
CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent
F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed
existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones
provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung
cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

### [401] [IM-LUT: Interpolation Mixing Look-Up Tables for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09923)
*Sejin Park,Sangmin Lee,Kyong Hwan Jin,Seung-Won Jung*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IM-LUT的新框架，通过混合多种插值函数实现任意尺度超分辨率（ASISR），解决了现有LUT方法固定尺度限制和计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法仅适用于固定尺度超分辨率，而ASISR技术通常计算成本高且内存需求大，因此需要一种高效且轻量的解决方案。

Method: 提出IM-LUT框架，通过IM-Net预测插值函数的混合权重，并利用LUT替换计算密集型操作，实现轻量高效的推理。

Result: 实验表明，IM-LUT在多个基准数据集上实现了图像质量与效率的优越平衡。

Conclusion: IM-LUT是一种适用于资源受限应用的高效超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at
enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table
(LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and
performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale
factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing
ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with
considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these
limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework
that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to
maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a
network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on
local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of
interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are
employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight
and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT
consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency
compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising
solution for resource-constrained applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多级融合架构，结合像素级、特征级和语义级信息，显著提升了脑肿瘤MRI分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤MRI分割的挑战在于肿瘤形态异质性和复杂的三维空间关系，现有方法未能充分利用医学报告中的语义知识。

Method: 采用多级融合架构，结合3D U-Net和CLIP模型，通过3D-2D语义桥接、跨模态语义指导和基于语义的注意力机制实现。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上，Dice系数达到0.8567，比传统3D U-Net提升4.8%，在增强肿瘤区域提升7.3%。

Conclusion: 多级融合架构显著提升了脑肿瘤分割的准确性，尤其在临床关键区域表现优异。

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor
(ET) region.

Conclusion: GMLN-BTS在资源受限的临床环境中实现了高精度、高效率的脑肿瘤分割。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI
scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address
this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million
parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer
models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This
work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,
resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in
resource-constrained clinical environments.

along with Leisegang et al.'s approach to defeasibility into the standpoint

for the expression of defeasibility on the level of implications, standpoint
modal operators, and standpoint-sharpening statements. We provide a
preferential semantics for this extended language and propose a tableaux

entailment. We also establish the computational complexity of the tableaux

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MPC-RL与MOBO的新框架，解决了传统MPC-RL收敛慢、策略学习次优和安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPC-RL方法存在收敛慢、策略学习次优和在线适应安全问题，需改进。

Method: 整合MPC-RL与MOBO，利用CDPG估计RL阶段成本及其梯度，通过EHVI函数优化MPC参数。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能高效、稳定地提升控制系统的闭环性能。

Conclusion: MPC-RL-MOBO框架在模型不完美情况下仍能实现高效、安全的学习。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a
structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL
methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However,
standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal
policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during
online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The
proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its
gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG)
approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables
efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop
performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient,
stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘LLM推理需要高面积效率和低EMA，同时保持高能效，现有方法无法满足这些需求。

Method: 采用HSA架构，结合MXINT4量化和优化数据流，减少EMA和去量化开销，并优化RMSNorm和RoPE单元。

Result: 在1.3B LLM上实现247/117（token/s/mm2），性能提升2.45x/13.5x，且能效优越。

Conclusion: 提出的HSA架构显著提升了边缘LLM推理的效率，适用于长输入/输出场景。

Abstract: Edge inference for large language models (LLM) offers secure, low-latency,
and cost-effective inference solutions. We emphasize that an edge accelerator
should achieve high area efficiency and minimize external memory access (EMA)
during the memory-bound decode stage, while maintaining high energy efficiency
during the compute intensive prefill stage. This paper proposes an edge LLM
inference accelerator featuring a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture that
optimizes inference efficiency in both stages. To further reduce EMA, we adopt
MXINT4 weight quantization and propose an optimized dataflow tailored for HSA,
ensuring negligible dequantization overhead and achieving 100% hardware
utilization with minimal accuracy loss under edge DRAM bandwidth constraints.
For non-linear operations, we incorporate optimized root mean square
normalization (RMSNorm) and rotary position embedding (RoPE) units, reducing
their latency, area, and memory access overhead while enabling end-to-end
inference on our accelerator. Our solution achieves 247/117 (token/s/mm2) while
running a 1.3B LLM on long-input/long-output scenarios, providing >2.45x/13.5x
improvement over existing approaches, while maintaining superior energy
efficiency in token generation.

Result: 精确版MAC单元面积效率提升29.2%，近似版能效提升7.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的设计在面积和能效上优于现有方法，同时通过近似设计进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Bit-level sparsity in quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) offers
significant potential for optimizing Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations.
However, two key challenges still limit its practical exploitation. First,
conventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity
of both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods
designed to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of
exploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the
fluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC
operations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for
dual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant
underutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study
proposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging
particlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of
partial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more
area- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less
significant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware
simplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second
challenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level
elasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC
unit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the
proposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency
compared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while
maintaining comparable energy efficiency. The approximate variant further
improves energy efficiency by 7.5%, compared to the exact version. Index-Terms:

Motivation: 旨在通过整合先进统计方法和机器学习模型，提升对股票间预测性关系的识别和利用能力。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型（GMM）聚类股票，结合格兰杰因果检验（GCT）、PCMCI测试和有效转移熵（ETE）构建因果推断流程，并利用动态时间规整（DTW）和KNN分类器确定最佳交易时机。

Conclusion: 研究为基于波动性的因果关系识别提供了系统方法，对金融建模和算法交易实践具有重要价值。

Abstract: Purpose: This study introduces a novel framework for identifying and
exploiting predictive lead-lag relationships in financial markets. We propose
an integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with
machine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of
predictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range
historical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting
clusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating
the Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary
Conditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to
identify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
and a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the
optimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously
backtested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested
from 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The
portfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the
10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics,
including a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain
pairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research
contributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable
trading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The
findings have significant implications for both academic research in financial
modelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a
structured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有Transformer在核苷酸序列分析中长程依赖捕捉不足和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 引入CARMANIA框架，结合转换矩阵损失（TM loss）与自注意力机制，对齐预测的标记转换与经验n-gram统计。

Result: 在多种基因组任务中表现优异，性能提升显著，尤其在增强子和管家基因分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CARMANIA通过全局一致性增强，显著提升了核苷酸序列分析的性能，尤其在长序列任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing
long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that
autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on
fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard
self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences
due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global
transition consistency.
  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian
Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised
pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a
transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions
with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence,
encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local
context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence
structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional
organization.
  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory
element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference,
antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster
classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at
least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior
results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster),
and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene
classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts
accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory
patterns drive prediction.

Method: 采用多任务学习联合优化共参与和语义相关性，融合多模态内容特征，并通过反倾向加权减少流行度偏差。

Result: 语义相关性提升（主题匹配率从51%增至63%），流行视频推荐减少13.8%，用户参与度提升0.04%。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义连贯性、参与度平衡和实际部署可扩展性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Related video recommendations commonly use collaborative filtering (CF)
driven by co-engagement signals, often resulting in recommendations lacking
semantic coherence and exhibiting strong popularity bias. This paper introduces
a novel multi-objective retrieval framework, enhancing standard two-tower
models to explicitly balance semantic relevance and user engagement. Our
approach uniquely combines: (a) multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly optimize
co-engagement and semantic relevance, explicitly prioritizing topical
coherence; (b) fusion of multimodal content features (textual and visual
embeddings) for richer semantic understanding; and (c) off-policy correction
(OPC) via inverse propensity weighting to effectively mitigate popularity bias.
Evaluation on industrial-scale data and a two-week live A/B test reveals our
framework's efficacy. We observed significant improvements in semantic
relevance (from 51% to 63% topic match rate), a reduction in popular item
distribution (-13.8% popular video recommendations), and a +0.04% improvement
in our topline user engagement metric. Our method successfully achieves better
semantic coherence, balanced engagement, and practical scalability for
real-world deployment.

Method: 重复去年设计，使用MS MARCO v2数据集，结合人工和合成查询（T5和GPT-4生成），评估LLM提示方法与传统方法的性能。

Result: LLM提示方法首次超越往年最佳方法（nnlm），合成查询评估结果与人工查询一致（τ=0.8487），未发现明显偏差。

Conclusion: LLM提示方法在排名任务中表现优异，合成查询可作为有效评估工具，未来可推广至其他研究领域。

Abstract: This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of
human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set,
based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with
passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using
labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO
queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike
the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more
difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO
(human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a
fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.
  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model
(LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach,
which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last
year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in
other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not
just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar
results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$.
However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries
that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4
were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using
T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.

six leading publicly available models from three providers for the
Retrieval-Augmented Debate and Evaluation. The evaluation is performed by
measuring four key metrics: Quality, Quantity, Manner, and Relation. Throughout

Such existing iterative methods typically combine reasoning with single hop
traversal at each step, making them vulnerable to LLM reasoning errors and
hallucinations that ultimately hinder the retrieval of relevant information.
  To address these limitations, we propose GraphRunner, a novel graph-based
retrieval framework that operates in three distinct stages: planning,
verification, and execution. This introduces high-level traversal actions that
enable multi-hop exploration in a single step. It also generates a holistic
traversal plan, which is verified against the graph structure and pre-defined
traversal actions, reducing reasoning errors and detecting hallucinations
before execution. GraphRunner significantly reduces LLM reasoning errors and
detects hallucinations through validation. Our evaluation using the GRBench
dataset shows that GraphRunner consistently outperforms existing approaches,
achieving 10-50% performance improvements over the strongest baseline while
reducing inference cost by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x,
making it significantly more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成检索中模型索引更新时计算成本高和资源受限的问题。

Method: 结合 Low-Rank Adaptation 专家混合和分层 OOD 驱动扩展策略，仅在检测到显著 OOD 文档时引入新专家。

Result: 在 NQ320k 和 MS MARCO Passage 上表现优于全模型更新基线，参数开销小且训练成本低。

Conclusion: MixLoRA-DSI 提供了一种高效且资源友好的模型索引更新方法。

Abstract: Continually updating model-based indexes in generative retrieval with new
documents remains challenging, as full retraining is computationally expensive
and impractical under resource constraints. We propose MixLoRA-DSI, a novel
framework that combines an expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts
with a layer-wise out-of-distribution (OOD)-driven expansion strategy. Instead
of allocating new experts for each new corpus, our proposed expansion strategy
enables sublinear parameter growth by selectively introducing new experts only
when significant number of OOD documents are detected. Experiments on NQ320k
and MS MARCO Passage demonstrate that MixLoRA-DSI outperforms full-model update
baselines, with minimal parameter overhead and substantially lower training
costs.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PRISM提出了一种新的文档到文档检索方法，通过多粒度表示和匹配，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖摘要作为稀疏的高层摘要，无法全面捕捉文档的多维度信息。

Method: PRISM将查询和候选论文分解为多个特定方面的视图并分别嵌入，然后进行多维度匹配。

Result: 实验表明，PRISM比现有基线方法平均提升了4.3%的性能。

Conclusion: PRISM通过多粒度表示和匹配，显著改进了文档到文档检索任务。

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document
retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query
paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have
focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full
documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide
only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a
novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple,
fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In
particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views
and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers
similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we
present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented
context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then,
experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3%
over existing retrieval baselines.

Conclusion: 为行业从业者提供了一种理解离线与在线指标关系的实用工具。

Abstract: A critical challenge in recommender systems is to establish reliable
relationships between offline and online metrics that predict real-world
performance. Motivated by recent advances in Pareto front approximation, we
introduce a pragmatic strategy for identifying offline metrics that align with
online impact. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to
simultaneously serve multiple test groups, each with distinct offline
performance metrics, in an online experiment controlled by a single model. The
method is model-agnostic for systems with a neural network backbone, enabling
broad applicability across architectures and domains. We validate the strategy
through a large-scale online experiment in the field of session-based
recommender systems on the OTTO e-commerce platform. The online experiment
identifies significant alignments between offline metrics and real-word
click-through rate, post-click conversion rate and units sold. Our strategy
provides industry practitioners with a valuable tool for understanding
offline-to-online metric relationships and making informed, data-driven
decisions.

Result: 研究发现Clio-X具有潜力，但也面临信任、系统透明度、经济和治理等障碍。

Conclusion: 通过参与式设计和去中心化治理，Clio-X为文化遗产领域提供了伦理部署AI的新模型。

Abstract: As archives turn to artificial intelligence to manage growing volumes of
digital records, privacy risks inherent in current AI data practices raise
critical concerns about data sovereignty and ethical accountability. This paper
explores how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and Web3 architectures can
support archives to preserve control over sensitive content while still being
able to make it available for access by researchers. We present Clio-X, a
decentralized, privacy-first Web3 digital solution designed to embed PETs into
archival workflows and support AI-enabled reference and access. Drawing on a
user evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype, the study reveals both interest
in the potential of the solution and significant barriers to adoption related
to trust, system opacity, economic concerns, and governance. Using Rogers'
Diffusion of Innovation theory, we analyze the sociotechnical dimensions of
these barriers and propose a path forward centered on participatory design and
decentralized governance through a Clio-X Decentralized Autonomous
Organization. By integrating technical safeguards with community-based
oversight, Clio-X offers a novel model to ethically deploy AI in cultural
heritage contexts.

Result: 在挪威车辆位置数据上验证，算法能保持交通管理效用并确保地理区域的公平表示。

Conclusion: 新算法有效平衡隐私、效用和公平性，适用于车辆交通管理系统。

Abstract: Location-based vehicular traffic management faces significant challenges in
protecting sensitive geographical data while maintaining utility for traffic
management and fairness across regions. Existing state-of-the-art solutions
often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and
demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis.
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges
regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based
vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing
reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all
regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making.
Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by
integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated
noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected.
We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing
the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based
data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for
traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all
geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented.
Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model,
illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions
across various cities. Our algorithm provides privacy in vehicular traffic

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，HomeLLaMA在保护隐私的同时提供个性化服务。

Conclusion: HomeLLaMA成功平衡了隐私保护与服务质量，为智能家居领域提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable generalizability in
language comprehension and hold significant potential to revolutionize
human-computer interaction in smart homes. Existing LLM-based smart home
assistants typically transmit user commands, along with user profiles and home
configurations, to remote servers to obtain personalized services. However,
users are increasingly concerned about the potential privacy leaks to the
remote servers. To address this issue, we develop HomeLLaMA, an on-device
assistant for privacy-preserving and personalized smart home serving with a
tailored small language model (SLM). HomeLLaMA learns from cloud LLMs to
deliver satisfactory responses and enable user-friendly interactions. Once
deployed, HomeLLaMA facilitates proactive interactions by continuously updating
local SLMs and user profiles. To further enhance user experience while
protecting their privacy, we develop PrivShield to offer an optional
privacy-preserving LLM-based smart home serving for those users, who are
unsatisfied with local responses and willing to send less-sensitive queries to
remote servers. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive benchmark DevFinder to
assess the service quality. Extensive experiments and user studies (M=100)
demonstrate that HomeLLaMA can provide personalized services while
significantly enhancing user privacy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了基于知识图谱的检索增强生成（KG-RAG）方法的安全性问题，提出了一种隐蔽的数据投毒攻击策略，并通过实验验证了其对KG-RAG性能的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KG-RAG方法在增强语言模型性能方面表现出色，但其结构化特性使其面临独特的安全风险，而现有研究仅关注非结构化数据源的RAG系统，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种隐蔽的攻击策略，通过识别对抗性目标答案并插入扰动三元组来误导KG-RAG的推理链，从而影响其生成结果。

Result: 实验表明，即使在最小扰动下，该攻击策略也能显著降低KG-RAG的性能，揭示了其内部阶段的安全威胁。

Conclusion: KG-RAG系统存在严重的安全漏洞，需进一步研究防御机制以提升其对抗数据投毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external data to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge
issues. Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources
and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been
increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG)
methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent
studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where
malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the
system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies
focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources,
leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that
KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature.
In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security
issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we
introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world
implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial
target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading
inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods
retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive
experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack
strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance,
even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to
understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and
to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.

Motivation: 黑客论坛内容嘈杂且非结构化，难以提取可操作的情报，亟需自动化方法识别高优先级威胁。

Method: 基于Transformer嵌入和对比学习，对论坛帖子进行聚类，并通过量化指标（如及时性、来源可信度）对事件进行排名。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效降噪并识别高优先级威胁，帮助安全分析师采取主动响应。

Conclusion: 该框架将非结构化的黑客论坛讨论转化为结构化情报，解决了自动化威胁检测的核心挑战。

Abstract: Hacker forums provide critical early warning signals for emerging
cybersecurity threats, but extracting actionable intelligence from their
unstructured and noisy content remains a significant challenge. This paper
presents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and
prioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach
leverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to
group related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying
incidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on
predefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that
prioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness,
source credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental
evaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method
effectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security
analysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum
discussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses
fundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs擅长代码生成，但在检测或避免代码漏洞方面表现不佳，研究旨在探究其原因是学习不足还是提示方法不当。

Method: 利用表示工程技术分析LLMs是否内部编码了漏洞概念，并开发MoC方法调整生成概率。

Result: MoC方法将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B的安全率提升8.9%，同时功能性能提升2.1%。

Conclusion: LLMs内部能识别漏洞，MoC方法为可控漏洞管理提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at sophisticated
code-generation tasks, yet remain ineffective at reliably detecting or avoiding
code vulnerabilities. Does this deficiency stem from insufficient learning
about code vulnerabilities, or is it merely a result of ineffective prompting?
Using representation engineering techniques, we investigate whether LLMs
internally encode the concepts necessary to identify code vulnerabilities. We
find that current LLMs encode precise internal representations that distinguish
vulnerable from secure code--achieving greater accuracy than standard prompting
approaches. Leveraging these vulnerability-sensitive representations, we
develop an inference-time steering technique that subtly modulates the model's
token-generation probabilities through a mixture of corrections (MoC). Our
method effectively guides LLMs to produce less vulnerable code without
compromising functionality, demonstrating a practical approach to controlled
vulnerability management in generated code. Notably, MoC enhances the security
ratio of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B by 8.9\%, while simultaneously improving
functionality on HumanEval pass@1 by 2.1\%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合同态加密（HE）和机器学习的新型框架，用于解决无人机（UAV）人脸检测中的隐私问题，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机人脸检测存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种既能保护数据隐私又不显著降低检测性能的方法。

Method: 结合同态加密（CKKS方案）和神经网络，设计了一种安全推理算法，直接在加密数据上进行计算，并开发了高效的数据编码方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时，检测准确性与未加密基准相比仅下降不到1%。

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机安全人脸检测提供了一种可行的解决方案，平衡了隐私保护和性能。

Abstract: This paper aims to propose a novel machine learning (ML) approach
incorporating Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to address privacy limitations in
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based face detection. Due to challenges related
to distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and
sophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic
environments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance
capabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that
integrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout
the inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with
minimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system
leverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly
on encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security.
Furthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed
to preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a
Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a
secure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption.
This approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial
data but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy
protection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based
secure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data
confidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than
1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption.

Motivation: 在联邦学习中，LoRA的高效性受到隐私泄露风险的挑战，传统差分隐私方法会损害模型性能或学习能力。

Method: 提出FedASK框架，采用两阶段草图管道：先聚合隐私保护的本地更新，再在服务器上重建全局矩阵。

Result: 理论证明FedASK的差分隐私保证和精确聚合特性，实验显示其在多种隐私设置和数据分布下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedASK在保护隐私的同时，有效解决了联邦LoRA框架中的性能与隐私权衡问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically require fine-tuning for
domain-specific tasks, and LoRA offers a computationally efficient approach by
training low-rank adapters. LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated
LLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without
sharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local
adapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying
differential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise
to both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one
adapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose
FedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double
Sketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of
both low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized
SVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first
aggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then
reconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating
of both adapters. We theoretically prove FedASK's differential privacy
guarantee and its exact aggregation property. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that FedASK consistently outperforms baseline methods across a
variety of privacy settings and data distributions.

TL;DR: AI Video Chat introduces a new RTC paradigm with MLLMs as peers, facing latency challenges. Artic framework addresses these by optimizing video streaming for AI understanding, reducing bitrate, and improving resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make AI-human video chat as intuitive as face-to-face interaction by addressing latency and network instability issues.

Method: Proposes Artic framework with Context-Aware Video Streaming and Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate, and introduces DeViBench for evaluation.

Result: Artic reduces bitrate while maintaining MLLM accuracy and improves resilience to network issues.

Conclusion: AI Video Chat requires novel solutions like Artic to overcome latency challenges, with ongoing research needed.

Abstract: AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC),
where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM).
This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting
face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to
latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving
very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and
instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI
from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an
AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network
requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To
reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose
Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video
region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important
regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive
Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames
while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality
on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video
Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions
and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.

Motivation: 6G等下一代无线技术需要满足超高数据速率、低延迟和增强连接性，而XL-MIMO和RIS是实现这些目标的关键技术。然而，其潜力依赖于准确的CSI，现有方法在可扩展性和实际部署中存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该轻量级框架为XL-MIMO系统中的高效信道估计提供了可行的解决方案，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding
requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced
connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and
energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control
over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However,
realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information
(CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded
channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of
existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing
number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to
real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume,
escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting
in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation
in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial
correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that
reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while
preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale
systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational
complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in
XL-MIMO systems.

Conclusion: 神经网络能独立发现量子物理中的边界与体态关联，无需先验知识。

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central
problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be
used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can
be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable
as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

### [430] [Covering a Few Submodular Constraints and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09879)
*Tanvi Bajpai,Chandra Chekuri,Pooja Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了多子模约束覆盖问题，针对固定常数r提出了随机双准则近似算法和加权覆盖函数的近似算法，展示了与r=1时相似的近似效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期应用中需要解决固定常数r的多子模约束覆盖问题，以弥补现有方法在大r时的不足。

Method: 提出了随机双准则近似算法和针对加权覆盖函数的LP自然近似算法。

Result: 对于固定r，算法实现了接近r=1时的近似效果，具体表现为双准则近似和加权覆盖函数的近似比。

Conclusion: 结果表明，固定r时可以获得与r=1相似的近似效果，为未来应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider the problem of covering multiple submodular constraints. Given a
finite ground set $N$, a cost function $c: N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $r$
monotone submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_r$ over $N$ and requirements
$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_r$ the goal is to find a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq N$
such that $f_i(S) \ge b_i$ for $1 \le i \le r$. When $r=1$ this is the
well-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work
\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and
developed bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms
for the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.
These are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting
problems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at
least $\Omega(\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In
this paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when
$r$ is a \emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering
multiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria
approximation algorithm that for any given integer $\alpha \ge 1$ outputs a set
$S$ such that $f_i(S) \ge$ $(1-1/e^\alpha -\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \in [r]$
and $\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \le (1+\epsilon)\alpha \cdot \sf{OPT}$. Second, when the
$f_i$ are weighted coverage functions from a deletion-closed set system we
obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$ $(\frac{e}{e-1})$ $(1+\beta)$-approximation where
$\beta$ is the approximation ratio for the underlying set cover instances via
the natural LP. These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an
approximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$. We mention
some applications that follow easily from these general results and anticipate
more in the future.

### [431] [Accurate generation of chemical reaction transition states by conditional flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10530)
*Ping Tuo,Jiale Chen,Ju Li*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: TS-GEN是一种生成模型，通过单次确定性过程直接从高斯先验映射到过渡态结构，显著提高了精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过渡态结构在化学反应中至关重要，但实验上难以捕捉，依赖高成本的DFT计算。TS-GEN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TS-GEN使用条件流匹配生成模型，将反应物和产物构象作为条件信息，通过最优传输路径生成过渡态结构。

Result: TS-GEN精度极高（RMSD 0.004 Å），速度极快（0.06秒/次），87%生成结果满足化学精度标准。

Conclusion: TS-GEN为高通量探索复杂反应网络提供了高效工具，有望推动新反应机制的研究。

Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy
barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them
experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a
conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple
Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a
single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product
conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent
noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively
replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or
string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a
root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\
\rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error
of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only
$0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet
chemical-accuracy criteria ($<1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially
outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to
out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom
precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly
useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the
way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.

*Abdelhalim Dahou,Ansgar Scherp,Sebastian Kurten,Brigitte Mathiak,Madhu Chauhan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化方法，用于分割研究用R代码，通过两种新颖方法（逐行分析和范围分割）和数据集StatCodeSeg，发现逐行分析效果更好，且小型语言模型优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码库规模增长，手动和语法分析方法变得不切实际，尤其是对于R等低资源语言及其研究领域，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两种方法：基于上下文的逐行分析和范围分割，实验中使用大型和小型语言模型（LLMs/SLMs），并验证其在Python代码上的通用性。

Result: 逐行分析优于范围分割，小型模型（如CodeBERT和CodeT5+）表现优于大型模型，尽管它们未在R代码上预训练。

Conclusion: 自动化逐行分析方法和小型语言模型在R代码分割中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Source code segmentation, dividing code into functionally coherent segments,
is crucial for knowledge retrieval and maintenance in software development.
While enabling efficient navigation and comprehension of large codebases,
manual and syntactic analysis approaches have become impractical as
repositories grow, especially for low-resource languages like R and their
research domains (e.g., social sciences, psychology).This paper introduces an
automated, domain-specific approach for research R code segmentation using
Large and Small Language Models (LLMs/SLMs). It presents two novel approaches
and a human-annotated dataset, StatCodeSeg. We explore two distinct approaches:
line-by-line analysis with context and range-based segment determination. We
experiment with LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs. To support the generalizability of
our approaches, we also include experiments on Python code from the computer
science domain.Our results show that context-based line-by-line analysis is
superior over range-based segmentation.Using smaller language models like
CodeBERT and an encoder-only version of CodeT5+ are better than their LLM
counterparts. Most notably, these two best-performing models did not see R code
during pre-training versus the LLMs but were only fine-tuned on 4,130 lines of
manually annotated code.

### [433] [Evaluating LLMs on Sequential API Call Through Automated Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09481)
*Yuheng Huang,Da Song,Zhenlan Ji,Shuai Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: StateGen是一个自动化框架，用于生成涉及顺序API交互的多样化编码任务，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖手动收集的测试用例，无法自动检查语义正确性，且忽略了顺序API调用的复杂交互。

Method: StateGen结合状态机约束求解、能量采样和控制流注入生成可执行程序，并通过两个LLM代理将其转化为自然语言任务描述。

Result: 构建了StateEval基准，包含120个已验证的测试用例，覆盖三个典型场景，实验证明StateGen能有效生成具有挑战性的API任务。

Conclusion: StateGen为评估和改进LLM工具使用提供了有效方法，揭示了当前LLM在API集成中的不足。

Abstract: By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex
real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use
remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually
collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for
semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string
matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex
interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in
real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen,
an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving
sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API
constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow
injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated
into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of
two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark
encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative
scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental
results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and
realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current
LLMs incorporating APIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物发现方法难以满足现代治疗需求，需要AI技术来优化实验室工作流程。

Method: Tippy采用五个专用AI智能体（Supervisor、Molecule、Lab、Analysis、Report）和Safety Guardrail，覆盖DMTA循环的各阶段。

Result: Tippy显著提高了工作流效率、决策速度和跨学科协作能力。

Conclusion: Tippy为AI辅助药物发现提供了新范式，展示了AI在实验室自动化中的潜力。

Abstract: The pharmaceutical industry faces unprecedented challenges in drug discovery,
with traditional approaches struggling to meet modern therapeutic development
demands. This paper introduces a novel AI framework, Tippy, that transforms
laboratory automation through specialized AI agents operating within the
Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle. Our multi-agent system employs five
specialized agents - Supervisor, Molecule, Lab, Analysis, and Report, with
Safety Guardrail oversight - each designed to excel in specific phases of the
drug discovery pipeline. Tippy represents the first production-ready
implementation of specialized AI agents for automating the DMTA cycle,
providing a concrete example of how AI can transform laboratory workflows. By
leveraging autonomous AI agents that reason, plan, and collaborate, we
demonstrate how Tippy accelerates DMTA cycles while maintaining scientific
rigor essential for pharmaceutical research. The system shows significant
improvements in workflow efficiency, decision-making speed, and
cross-disciplinary coordination, offering a new paradigm for AI-assisted drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SetupBench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在裸Linux沙盒中完成环境引导任务的能力，结果显示当前代理在多个任务类别中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在预装环境中评估LLM代理，未能反映真实世界任务中的环境引导挑战，因此需要一个新的测试标准。

Method: 引入SetupBench，包含93个任务实例，涵盖多种语言生态系统、数据库引擎和多服务编排场景，通过自然语言问题描述和确定性成功命令进行评估。

Result: OpenHands代理在多个任务类别中成功率低，尤其是在仓库设置和本地数据库配置中，且存在系统性失败模式和探索策略效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: SetupBench揭示了当前LLM代理在环境引导能力上的不足，为下一代软件开发代理提供了严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise end to end assistance with
real-world software tasks, yet existing benchmarks evaluate LLM agents almost
exclusively in pre-baked environments where every dependency is pre-installed.
To fill this gap, we introduce SetupBench, a 93 instance benchmark that
isolates the environment-bootstrap skill: starting from a bare Linux sandbox,
an agent must install packages, resolve dependency conflicts, initialize
databases, and configure background services. Our tasks span seven language
ecosystems, five database engines, and multi-service orchestration scenarios,
each accompanies by a natural language problem statement and a deterministic
success command. Through evaluation of OpenHands, a state-of-the-art coding
agent, we find low success rates across task categories, with particular
challenges in repository setup (38.9-57.4%) and local database configuration
(20.0-53.3%). Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes including
incomplete development tooling installation, hallucinated task constraints, and
non-persistent environment modifications that break agent-human collaboration
workflows. We identify substantial inefficiencies in agent exploration
strategies, with 38-89% of actions being unnecessary compared to optimal human
behavior. These findings highlight gaps in current agents' practical
environment-bootstrap capabilities. By targeting this critical yet
under-evaluated capability, SetupBench provides a rigorous yard-stick for the
next generation of software developer agents aiming to solve end to end
real-wold tasks.

TL;DR: SPICE是一个自动化标注工具，用于高效生成软件工程数据集标签，显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量标注数据集对软件工程基础模型至关重要，但人工标注成本高昂且耗时。

Method: SPICE结合上下文感知代码导航、基于推理的提示和多轮共识，生成接近专家标注的标签。

Result: SPICE在标注1000个实例时，成本从10万美元降至5.10美元，并与人工标注数据高度一致。

Conclusion: SPICE为大规模、低成本的软件工程数据集创建提供了可行方案，并发布了相关工具和数据集。

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often
prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable,
automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for
issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines
context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass
consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations.
SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling
more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with
human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000
instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results
demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset
creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE
tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated
from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench
Verified).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NISQ时代，量子电路的优化面临噪声和硬件限制的挑战，需要一种智能且灵活的优化方法。

Result: 系统输出优化的量子电路，适应硬件约束，减少门数和深度，提高保真度。

Conclusion: OrQstrator为NISQ时代的量子电路优化提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach, OrQstrator, which is a modular framework for
conducting quantum circuit optimization in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) era. Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our
orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit
optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count
via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs
efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized
circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits
during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central
orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit
structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as
gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized
circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques
from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt
to backend constraints.

Motivation: 软件配置选项繁多且影响性能，传统机器学习方法计算成本高，LLMs可能提供高效解决方案。

Method: 通过提示LLMs完成相关选项识别、配置排序和性能推荐等任务，评估其在编译器、视频编码器等系统中的表现。

Result: LLMs在某些任务上与专家知识一致，但也存在幻觉或浅层推理问题。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在软件配置中的系统评估和解决方案设计提供了初步探索。

Abstract: Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can
affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size,
or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and
requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand,
machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a
high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations
are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language
models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through
prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant
options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations
across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT
solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable
limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert
knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other
cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and
the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.

we introduce LiveRepoReflection, a challenging benchmark for evaluating code
understanding and generation in multi-file repository contexts, featuring 1,888
rigorously filtered test cases across $6$ programming languages to ensure
diversity, correctness, and high difficulty. Further, we create

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动编写形式化规范既繁琐又容易出错，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然表现良好，但其庞大的规模和计算需求引发了对小型模型可行性的探讨。

Method: 构建包含提示、推理日志和后置条件的专用数据集，并对一个7B参数的代码模型进行监督微调，以处理真实世界的仓库依赖关系并保留前置状态信息。

Result: 在真实Java缺陷基准测试（Defects4J）中，该小型模型在语法正确性、语义正确性和缺陷区分能力上匹配或超越了大型模型（如GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 通过针对性微调和适度数据集，小型模型可以实现以往仅大型模型才能达到的效果，为自动化规范生成提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Formal specifications are essential for ensuring software correctness, yet
manually writing them is tedious and error-prone. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promise in generating such specifications from natural language
intents, but the giant model size and high computational demands raise a
fundamental question: Do we really need large models for this task? In this
paper, we show that a small, fine-tuned language model can achieve high-quality
postcondition generation with much lower computational costs. We construct a
specialized dataset of prompts, reasoning logs, and postconditions, then
supervise the fine-tuning of a $7$B-parameter code model. Our approach tackles
real-world repository dependencies and preserves pre-state information,
allowing for expressive and accurate specifications. We evaluate the model on a
benchmark of real-world Java bugs (Defects4J) and compare against both
proprietary giants (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source large models. Empirical
results demonstrate that our compact model matches or outperforms significantly
larger counterparts in syntax correctness, semantic correctness, and
bug-distinguishing capability. These findings highlight that targeted
fine-tuning on a modest dataset can enable small models to achieve results
formerly seen only in massive, resource-heavy LLMs, offering a practical and
efficient path for the real-world adoption of automated specification
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD建模目前仍是一个耗时的手动任务，现有方法未能充分利用LLMs的潜力。

Method: 基于GPT-4.1生成高质量描述的数据集，并微调代码-LLMs以从自然语言生成JSON格式的CAD序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著加速CAD设计，并引入了几何和拓扑指标以评估生成对象的质量。

Conclusion: CADmium方法证明了利用LLMs自动化CAD设计的可行性和有效性，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects,
and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications
like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains
largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate
this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence
representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this
work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models
annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our
pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs
to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural
language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this
approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail
to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and
topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler
characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and
ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that
CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of
new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

(0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance
approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling
yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while
reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful
diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有pMHC-I肽数据集和模型的偏差问题，以更准确地发现新型肽配体，推动个性化疫苗和T细胞免疫疗法的发展。

Method: 采用扩散模型，基于晶体结构相互作用距离设计pMHC-I肽，构建了一个独立于传统数据集的基准。

Result: 新基准能重现经典锚定残基偏好，且现有序列预测模型对其识别能力较差，揭示了传统评估中未发现的局限性。

Conclusion: 结构引导的设计方法提供了高结构完整性和多样性的肽段，为无偏模型训练和评估提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on
identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting
potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases
present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of
novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided
benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on
crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA
alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet
reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural
generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we
demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at
recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs,
indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations.
Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted
structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets,
representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation. Our
code, and data are available at: https://github.com/sermare/struct-mhc-dev.

Abstract: Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data
modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical
factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and
heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models
(FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data
serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new
avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing
treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted
integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational
approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends
in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological
frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer
subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome
prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional
ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs
advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with
advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available
multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration.
We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the
essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale,
pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from
conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology,
while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era
of large-scale AI models in cancer research.

Motivation: 解决转移性黑色素瘤中抗PD-1免疫治疗的先天耐药性问题，揭示其分子机制。

Method: 使用患者肿瘤活检的转录组数据构建动态概率布尔网络模型，结合强化学习和可解释人工智能分析。

Result: 发现临时抑制LOXL2蛋白的四步干预策略能消除耐药性分子特征。

Conclusion: 提出了一种时间依赖性治疗假设，为复杂生物系统中的干预策略提供了计算框架。

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical
challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being
poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic
Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to
elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a
reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step
therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to
mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed
that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2
protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis
showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the
molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct
without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel,
time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance
and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious
intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于2D FDTD的声波传播模拟框架，用于虚拟应用中低频声波现象的捕捉，并通过Unreal Engine实现动态播放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业声学建模方法未能全面模拟声波现象，影响了虚拟应用的沉浸感。

Method: 通过2D网格离散化场景几何，使用Python FDTD求解器模拟声波传播，并通过虚拟麦克风阵列记录压力响应，最终生成多通道脉冲响应。

Result: 测试结果与理论预期一致，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为低频声波现象模拟提供了可行方案，并具备商业扩展潜力。

Abstract: Accurate sound propagation simulation is essential for delivering immersive
experiences in virtual applications, yet industry methods for acoustic modeling
often do not account for the full breadth of acoustic wave phenomena. This
paper proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) framework that simulates sound propagation as a wave-based model in
Unreal Engine, with an emphasis on capturing lower frequency wave phenomena,
embedding occlusion, diffraction, reflection and interference in generated
impulse responses. The process begins by discretizing the scene geometry into a
2D grid via a top-down projection from which obstacle masks and boundary
conditions are derived. A Python-based FDTD solver injects a sine sweep at a
source position, and virtual quadraphonic microphone arrays record pressure
field responses at pre-defined listener positions. De-convolution of the
pressure responses yields multi-channel impulse responses that retain spatial
directionality which are then integrated into Unreal Engine's audio pipeline
for dynamic playback. Benchmark tests confirm agreement with analytical
expectations, and the paper outlines hybrid extensions aimed at commercial
viability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在匿名化空中交通管制（ATC）语音数据中检测压力的方法，展示了隐私保护与高性能深度学习模型可以共存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中交通管制（ATC）工作压力大且错误后果严重，检测压力对维持安全至关重要，但语音数据处理涉及隐私限制（如GDPR）。

Method: 评估了多种架构在匿名化ATC语音数据中的压力检测性能，使用了匿名化的SUSAS数据集和ATC模拟数据集。

Result: 最佳网络在匿名化SUSAS数据集上达到93.6%的准确率，在匿名化ATC模拟数据集上达到80.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: 隐私保护不会阻碍构建高性能的深度学习模型。

Abstract: Air traffic control (ATC) demands multi-tasking under time pressure with high
consequences of an error. This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key
point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC
voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with
these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection
for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress
detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under
Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our
anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be
an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Lombard语音风格的语音转换（VC）方法，通过隐式和显式声学特征条件对比，发现隐式条件方法在保持说话人相似性的同时，能实现与显式条件相当的清晰度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lombard语音风格能提升语音清晰度，适用于听力受损和嘈杂环境，但数据采集困难。语音转换（VC）可作为数据不足时的增强技术。

Method: 比较了隐式和显式声学特征条件的语音转换模型。

Result: 隐式条件方法在清晰度提升上与显式条件相当，同时保持了说话人相似性。

Conclusion: 隐式条件策略是一种有效的Lombard语音风格转换方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems in Lombard speaking style can improve the
overall intelligibility of speech, useful for hearing loss and noisy
conditions. However, training those models requires a large amount of data and
the Lombard effect is challenging to record due to speaker and noise
variability and tiring recording conditions. Voice conversion (VC) has been
shown to be a useful augmentation technique to train TTS systems in the absence
of recorded data from the target speaker in the target speaking style. In this
paper, we are concerned with Lombard speaking style transfer. Our goal is to
convert speaker identity while preserving the acoustic attributes that define
the Lombard speaking style. We compare voice conversion models with implicit
and explicit acoustic feature conditioning. We observe that our proposed
implicit conditioning strategy achieves an intelligibility gain comparable to
the model conditioned on explicit acoustic features, while also preserving
speaker similarity.

Motivation: 随着生成音频模型的快速发展，区分人类创作与生成音乐变得困难，因此需要研究检测伪造音乐模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含真实和合成音乐的数据集，应用多种音频变换，分析其对分类准确率的影响，测试最新音乐深度伪造检测模型的性能。

Result: 模型的性能在音频增强下显著下降，即使是轻微的增强也会导致分类准确率降低。

Conclusion: 检测伪造音乐的模型在音频增强下表现脆弱，需进一步改进以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative audio models, distinguishing between
human-composed and generated music is becoming increasingly challenging. As a
response, models for detecting fake music have been proposed. In this work, we
explore the robustness of such systems under audio augmentations. To evaluate
model generalization, we constructed a dataset consisting of both real and
synthetic music generated using several systems. We then apply a range of audio
transformations and analyze how they affect classification accuracy. We test
the performance of a recent state-of-the-art musical deepfake detection model
in the presence of audio augmentations. The performance of the model decreases
significantly even with the introduction of light augmentations.

TL;DR: AudioMAE++是一种改进的音频掩码自编码器，通过引入macaron-style transformer块和门控线性单元，在音频分类和语音任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频MAE方法仍使用传统transformer模块，而transformer领域已有新进展未被充分利用。

Method: 提出AudioMAE++，采用macaron-style transformer块和门控线性单元进行改进。

Result: 在AudioSet数据集上预训练后，AudioMAE++在10项下游任务中优于现有MAE方法，且参数效率更高。

Conclusion: AudioMAE++通过架构改进显著提升了音频表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) trained on audio spectrogram patches have emerged
as a prominent approach for learning self-supervised audio representations.
While several recent papers have evaluated key aspects of training MAEs on
audio data, the majority of these approaches still leverage vanilla transformer
building blocks, whereas the transformer community has seen steady integration
of newer architectural advancements. In this work, we propose AudioMAE++, a
revamped audio masked autoencoder with two such enhancements, namely
macaron-style transformer blocks with gated linear units. When pretrained on
the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AudioMAE++ models outperform existing MAE
based approaches on 10 diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating excellent
performance on audio classification and speech-based benchmarks. The proposed
AudioMAE++ models also demonstrate excellent scaling characteristics,
outperforming directly comparable standard MAE baselines with up to 4x more
parameters.

Conclusion: WildFX为AI音乐生成提供了实用的工具，填补了专业DSP工作流建模的空白。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling
of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging.
In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of
audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based
approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter
interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin
approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance
relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational
constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for
generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered
by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports
seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the
wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g.,
sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A
minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration.
Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of
mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research
with practical DSP demands. The code is available on:
