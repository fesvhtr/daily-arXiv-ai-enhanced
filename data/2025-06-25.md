### [1] [Correspondence-Free Multiview Point Cloud Registration via Depth-Guided Joint Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18922)
*Yiran Zhou,Yingyu Wang,Shoudong Huang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需特征匹配的多视角点云配准方法，通过全局深度图优化实现高精度配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特征提取和数据关联，难以在复杂环境中获得全局最优解。

Method: 将全局地图表示为深度图，利用原始深度信息构建非线性最小二乘优化问题，联合估计点云位姿和全局地图。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，方法在精度上优于现有技术，尤其在特征提取和数据关联困难的复杂环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过隐式数据关联和动态优化，有效解决了复杂环境中的多视角点云配准问题。

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

### [2] [Connecting Vision and Emissions: A Behavioural AI Approach to Carbon Estimation in Road Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18924)
*Ammar K Al Mhdawi,Nonso Nnamoko,Safanah Mudheher Raafat,M. K. S. Al-Mhdawi,Amjad J Humaidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLOv8的实时车辆检测与分类框架，用于估算城市环境中的碳排放。系统通过改进YOLOv8架构，结合OCR模块和外部数据库验证，实现了高精度的碳排放计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决YOLOv8在细粒度识别任务（如车牌识别和车辆属性分类）上的不足，为智能交通系统提供可扩展的碳排放监测方案。

Method: 采用混合管道，结合YOLOv8检测、分割与跟踪，以及专有的OCR模块进行车牌识别和车辆分类，并通过外部数据库验证。

Result: YOLOv8检测器mAP@0.5达71%，OCR字符级准确率最高99%。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了实时目标检测与深度OCR结合在智能交通系统中的可行性，为车辆碳排放监测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

### [3] [Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18925)
*Tahereh Zarrat Ehsan,Michael Tangermann,Yağmur Güçlütürk,Bastiaan R. Bloem,Luc J. W. Evers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于计算机视觉的量化帕金森病（PD）运动特征的方法，通过视频分析评估手指敲击测试，提高了MDS-UPDRS评分的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手指敲击测试评估主观性强，存在评分者间和评分者内差异，且无法捕捉个体运动特征的细节。

Method: 使用计算机视觉从视频中提取四组临床相关特征，量化运动障碍，并通过机器学习分类器预测MDS-UPDRS评分。

Result: 视频分析特征与四种运动缺陷对应，机器学习分类器的评分预测准确性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为PD运动特征的客观评估提供了实用解决方案，未来需验证其对症状治疗和疾病进展的响应性。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

### [4] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Grouping for Tubular Structure Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18930)
*Chong Di,Shuwang Zhou,Da Chen,Jean-Marie Mirebeau,Minglei Shu,Laurent D. Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的新框架，用于跟踪管状结构的最小路径，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂形态和环境变化时存在计算效率低和依赖先验知识的问题。

Method: 将分段跟踪建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），利用Q-Learning动态探索分段图，按需计算边权重并自适应扩展搜索空间。

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上显著优于现有方法，能有效处理复杂拓扑并保持全局路径一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖大量先验知识，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

### [5] [Bird's-eye view safety monitoring for the construction top under the tower crane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18938)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的全自动塔吊安全监控系统，通过摄像头和LiDAR融合3D数据，实时监测施工现场人员与模块化建筑的位置，避免碰撞并保障工人安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着塔吊操作日益自动化和智能化，安全问题的自动化技术应用变得尤为重要，尤其是在模块化建筑施工中，保护工人免受塔吊与建筑顶部区域的碰撞风险。

Method: 系统整合摄像头和LiDAR捕获的3D信息，通过AI技术实现人员和模块化建筑的定位，并开发了软件管道与硬件及显示系统结合。

Result: 系统在真实工地的测试中验证了其准确性和有效性，能够作为现场安全监控的有力工具。

Conclusion: 该系统为塔吊施工提供了高效的安全监控解决方案，证明了AI和3D数据融合在施工现场安全中的实用价值。

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans
and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The
state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

### [6] [Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939)
*Rui An,Yifeng Zhang,Ziran Liang,Wenqi Fan,Yuxuan Liang,Xuequn Shang,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Damba-ST模型，解决城市时空预测中的计算复杂性和跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用的城市时空基础模型，以在数据稀缺或未见区域部署服务，但现有Transformer模型计算复杂且内存开销大。

Method: 基于Mamba的线性复杂度优势，提出Damba-ST模型，引入域自适应状态空间模型和三种域适配器。

Result: Damba-ST在预测任务中表现优异，具备零样本泛化能力，无需大量微调即可部署到新环境。

Conclusion: Damba-ST高效且泛化能力强，为城市时空预测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [From Pixels and Words to Waves: A Unified Framework for Spectral Dictionary vLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18943)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDict-VLM是一种新型视觉语言模型，通过频谱字典标记混合器替代卷积和自注意力，实现了高效且可解释的多模态处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖计算密集的卷积和自注意力机制，限制了效率和可扩展性。

Method: 引入频谱字典标记混合器，将图像块或词片表示为可学习频率原子的稀疏组合。

Result: SDict-VLM在MS-COCO和VQAv2上表现优异，性能接近BLIP-2，但参数和计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效且可解释的视觉语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

### [8] [DiffRIS: Enhancing Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18946)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRIS利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，通过上下文感知适配器和渐进式跨模态推理解码器，提升了遥感图像分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中因尺度变化、多样方向和语义模糊性带来的挑战。

Method: 提出CP-adapter动态优化语言特征，PCMRD逐步对齐文本与视觉区域。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: DiffRIS验证了预训练扩散模型在遥感应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

### [9] [GLIMPSE: Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation for Generative LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18985)
*Guanxi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于可视化大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在开放视觉问答（VQA）中依赖的图像区域，同时揭示多模态文本显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LVLMs在生成自由形式文本响应时的视觉注意力分布，以诊断幻觉、暴露偏见并确保模型透明度。

Method: 结合梯度加权注意力、自适应层传播和加权令牌聚合，生成响应级别的归因热图。

Result: GLIMPSE在人类对齐方面优于先前的可解释性方法，并能揭示细粒度的跨模态归因、令牌级推理动态以及人类注意力偏差。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE为LVLMs的跨模态推理提供了有效的可解释性工具，有助于分析模型行为、幻觉和偏见。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

### [10] [Diffusion Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation for High-Resolution Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18999)
*Yuan Yao,Yicong Hong,Difan Liu,Long Mai,Feng Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为T2MD的方法，通过蒸馏技术将基于自注意力的扩散Transformer转换为线性复杂度的Mamba模型，以降低高分辨率图像生成的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在扩散Transformer中的二次计算复杂度导致高分辨率图像生成的计算成本高昂，而直接训练Mamba模型存在挑战。

Method: 提出T2MD方法，结合自注意力与Mamba的混合模型，通过层级的教师强制和基于特征的知识蒸馏，降低训练难度。

Result: 实验表明，T2MD能够以较低开销生成高质量的文本到图像，并支持2048×2048分辨率的生成。

Conclusion: 研究证明了Mamba模型在非因果视觉输出生成中的可行性，为未来探索提供了潜力。

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

*Jinlong Li,Dong Zhao,Qi Zang,Zequn Jie,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OoPk的新方法，通过正交投影子空间和在线先验知识聚合策略，解决了持续测试时间适应（CTTA）中的灾难性遗忘和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法在平衡性能和高效模型适应方面存在困难，尤其是在复杂任务（如语义分割）中。

Method: 使用正交投影子空间保护预训练模型知识，同时采用在线先验知识聚合策略增强模型适应性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在语义分割任务中超越了现有CTTA方法，表现优异。

Conclusion: OoPk方法有效解决了CTTA中的关键问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了竞争性表现。

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Legato在OMR任务中表现出色，为端到端OMR提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music
recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable
of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

Conclusion: HAWAII框架高效且性能优越，适用于视觉语言模型的优化。

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

TL;DR: RareSpot提出了一种结合多尺度一致性学习和上下文感知增强的检测框架，显著提升了小且稀有的野生动物（如草原犬鼠）在航拍图像中的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草原犬鼠等小且稀有的野生动物在生态保护中至关重要，但其检测因体型小、分布稀疏和视觉特征不明显而具有挑战性。

Method: RareSpot通过多尺度一致性学习和上下文感知增强，优化特征表示并生成具有挑战性的训练样本。

Result: 在专家标注的草原犬鼠航拍图像基准测试中，RareSpot的检测精度比基线方法提高了35%以上，并在其他野生动物数据集中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RareSpot为复杂航拍场景中小且稀有物种的检测提供了新方法，支持生态监测工作。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一致性模型的新框架，仅需四步即可实现高质量图像编辑，显著提升重建精度和编辑效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像编辑中计算量大，而蒸馏模型因反转质量差导致编辑能力受限。高保真反转和重建对精确编辑至关重要。

Method: 采用一致性模型增强图像反转，引入循环一致性优化策略，平衡编辑性和内容保留。

Result: 在多种图像编辑任务和数据集上达到最先进性能，匹配或超越全步扩散模型，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和编辑质量上取得突破，为图像编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/ControlGenAI/Inverse-and-Edit.

TL;DR: PrITTI是一种基于潜在扩散的框架，利用3D基元生成可控、可编辑的3D语义场景布局，优于体素方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体素表示内存密集、分辨率固定和难以编辑的问题，基元表示更紧凑且易于操作。

Method: 采用混合表示，地面用栅格化格式，物体用矢量化3D基元，并引入稳定的Cholesky参数化解码尺寸和方向。

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上，PrITTI生成质量优于体素基线，内存需求减少3倍，支持实例级操作和多种下游应用。

Conclusion: PrITTI为3D语义场景生成提供了高效、灵活且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MobileViT的轻量级RGB-T跟踪算法，通过渐进式融合框架和可分离注意力实现高效多模态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态跟踪在低光照和恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，多模态跟踪（如RGB-T）利用互补数据提升性能，但现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 采用MobileViT构建轻量级跟踪器，引入渐进式融合框架和可分离注意力学习模态内和模态间交互。

Result: 模型参数少于400万，GPU推理速度达122帧/秒，性能与现有高效多模态跟踪器相当。

Conclusion: 首次将MobileViT用于RGB-T跟踪，实现了高效、轻量的多模态跟踪，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、基于感知的关键帧提取框架，适用于在线视频的内容审核和摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频在政治话语和网络社会威胁（如错误信息、宣传和激进化）中扮演重要角色，检测视频中的关键帧对内容审核和摘要生成至关重要。

Method: PRISM在CIELAB色彩空间中使用感知颜色差异度量，无需训练且计算高效。

Result: 在BBC、TVSum、SumMe和ClipShots数据集上，PRISM表现出高准确性和压缩比。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种可扩展的工具，适用于分析和审核在线平台中的有害或政治敏感内容。

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管事件是全球主要死因，现有风险评估方法存在采样偏差和单模态限制，需要更全面的方法。

Method: 结合胸部X光和心电图数据，采用多模态对齐、因果推理和双反向传播图技术，开发了MOSCARD模型。

Result: 在内部和外部数据集上，MOSCARD模型表现优于单模态和现有先进模型（AUC分别为0.75、0.83、0.71）。

Conclusion: MOSCARD模型为低成本机会性筛查提供了有效工具，有助于早期干预和改善患者预后。

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

Motivation: 随着CT检查需求的增加，诊断错误问题日益突出，而现有医学视觉问答（VQA）基准缺乏临床相关性，无法评估专家级知识。

Method: 提出MedErr-CT基准，包含六类错误（四种视觉相关错误和两种词汇错误），并分为分类、检测和纠正三个任务级别。

Result: 评估了当前先进的3D医学MLLMs，发现它们在不同错误类型上的表现差异显著。

Conclusion: MedErr-CT有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误并提高临床实践的准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Result: Video-XL-2在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最先进性能，并能在单张GPU上高效处理上万帧视频。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新的稀疏化技术，为长视频理解提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

Conclusion: MSR-Align为提升推理能力VLMs的安全对齐提供了可扩展且有效的基础，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3D-SSM及相关模块显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CAN和SPCAN在无监督域适应中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled

object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基础设施V2X系统部署成本高且在乡村和郊区存在覆盖盲区，无人机提供了灵活且低成本的替代方案。

Method: 利用无人机采集6.73小时的多场景驾驶数据，涵盖城市、郊区和乡村环境，以及不同天气和光照条件。

Result: 数据集支持车辆与无人机（V2D）算法的开发和标准化评估，填补了空中辅助自动驾驶系统的空白。

Conclusion: AirV2X-Perception为无人机辅助自动驾驶系统的发展提供了重要资源，数据集已开源。

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The
dataset and development kits are open-sourced at

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对水道环境的图像描述数据集WaterCaption，并开发了边缘可部署的多模态大语言模型Da Yu，通过Nano Transformer Adaptor提升长文本生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水道感知模型缺乏全局语义理解，限制了大规模监测和结构化日志生成。利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）填补这一空白。

Method: 提出WaterCaption数据集（20.2k图像-文本对）和Da Yu模型，采用Nano Transformer Adaptor（NTA）平衡计算效率与视觉特征建模能力。

Result: Da Yu在WaterCaption及其他描述基准上性能优于现有模型，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: WaterCaption和Da Yu为水道环境提供了新的视觉地理理解和空间场景认知研究方向。

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

TL;DR: HoliGS是一种新颖的可变形高斯泼溅框架，用于从长单目RGB视频中实现视图合成，通过分层变形策略显著提升重建质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有4D高斯泼溅和动态NeRF方法在长时间捕捉中的训练开销问题，提供更高效、准确的动态环境重建方案。

Method: 将场景分解为静态背景和时间变化对象，利用可逆高斯泼溅变形网络实现全局刚性变换、骨架驱动和细微非刚性变形。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上实现更优重建质量，同时显著减少训练和渲染时间。

Conclusion: HoliGS为真实场景中的EVS提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

Motivation: 现有方法在伪装物体分割中存在领域差距和分割不精确的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 利用VLM引导的SAM进行分割，并通过alpha通道保留完整图像上下文进行分类。

Conclusion: 通过结合VLM和SAM，实现了更精确的伪装物体分割和分类，展示了VLM语义的丰富性在任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Conclusion: 结合人类注视数据的方法为临床技能评估提供了更客观的工具，尤其适用于高压环境，有望改善临床培训和患者预后。

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Result: 在3D AffordanceNet数据集上，准确率和mIoU优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LM-AD通过AQM模块显著提升了3D点云与文本对齐的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进式模态合作（PMC）的多模态域适应框架，用于在源域和目标域之间转移知识，支持多模态域适应（MMDA）和特权信息多模态域适应（MMDA-PI）设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态域适应问题，特别是在目标域中某些模态缺失的情况下，如何有效利用源域的多模态数据。

Method: 提出PMC框架，包含两个新模块：多模态合作选择可靠伪标签目标样本，以及PMC-PI方法，通过多模态数据生成（MMG）网络生成目标域缺失的模态。

Result: 在三个图像数据集和八个视频数据集上的实验验证了PMC框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PMC框架在多模态跨域视觉识别任务中表现出色，尤其是在处理缺失模态的情况下。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Method: 提出RetCoP框架，采用重放策略和信息蒸馏方法，持续整合图像和文本特征。

Result: 实验显示RetCoP在泛化能力和遗忘率上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: RetCoP为多模态眼底图像分析提供了有效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态融合中的不平衡和不完整问题，提升了生存预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results

Conclusion: MotionEcho通过教师强制和动态计算分配，有效解决了蒸馏模型在运动定制上的挑战，为快速高效视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs在训练过程中文本识别能力的出现方式及其与语义理解能力发展的差异。

Method: 通过分析VLMs的训练过程，观察文本可读性和语义理解能力的发展模式。

Result: 文本可读性在大量训练迭代后突然出现，而语义理解能力则从早期逐渐发展。文本匹配能力发展更慢。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要定制训练策略以加速VLMs的文本理解能力，为未来多模态学习优化奠定基础。

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

TL;DR: HDD模型通过分层采样方法显著降低计算负担，同时保持高精度，适用于气候降尺度任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降尺度方法计算量大，AI降尺度模型（如扩散模型）虽有效但仍计算密集，需更轻量级方案。

Method: 提出分层扩散降尺度（HDD）模型，采用分层采样和简单下采样方案，减少计算量。

Result: 在ERA5和CMIP6数据集上表现优异，计算量减少50%，且模型可跨分辨率迁移。

Conclusion: HDD为气候降尺度提供轻量级解决方案，支持高效生成高分辨率气候数据。

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

Result: 实验表明GLCANet在精度和计算效率上优于现有方法，适用于大尺寸高分辨率图像处理。

Conclusion: GLCANet为实际遥感应用提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于事件相机的MAV检测方法，利用高速旋转螺旋桨在事件流中的特征，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAV检测方法主要依赖RGB图像中的外观特征，难以实现泛化检测。作者发现不同MAV在事件流中因螺旋桨高速旋转而具有共同特征。

Method: 提出三个模块，从原始事件流中提取螺旋桨的显著时空特征，同时过滤背景噪声和相机运动。

Result: 在未训练的情况下，方法显著优于现有技术，测试数据集上精确率和召回率分别达到83.0%和81.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过事件流特征实现了高效的MAV检测，并发布了首个事件基MAV数据集。

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Motivation: 解决现有VLN方法在复杂场景中长期记忆和空间推理的局限性，提供统一的记忆系统以提升导航性能。

Method: 提出Mem4Nav，结合稀疏八叉树（精细体素索引）和语义拓扑图（高层地标连接），通过可逆Transformer嵌入存储为可训练记忆令牌，分为长期记忆（LTM）和短期记忆（STM）。

Result: 在Touchdown和Map2Seq数据集上，Mem4Nav显著提升了任务完成率（7-13个百分点）、路径效率（SPD降低）和导航准确性（nDTW提升>10个百分点）。

Conclusion: Mem4Nav通过分层地图和双记忆模块的有效结合，显著提升了VLN任务的性能，证明了其设计的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Conclusion: 框架有效融合医学图像与表格数据，FT-Mamba在特征提取和图像编码指导中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

Result: 在ImageNet上的大量定量评估表明，该方法有效且优于现有基线，能生成更满意的解释。

Conclusion: 通过抑制特征而非添加噪声，解决了样本分布不对齐问题，提高了属性分析的可信度。

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏大规模真实数据集时的模型训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide

Motivation: 糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）影响近半数糖尿病患者，需要早期检测。现有自动化方法存在特征提取效率低、依赖手工先验和数据不足的问题。

Conclusion: HMSViT在性能和临床实用性上表现出色，展示了其在现实诊断应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter为驾驶场景的3D一致性编辑提供了高效解决方案，推动了自动驾驶模拟的发展。

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉输入和文本输出之间存在不一致（视觉幻觉），这在安全关键应用中存在风险，需要有效的评估基准和检测方法。

Method: 开发了PRE-HAL数据集评估LVLM的感知和推理能力，并提出基于DST的视觉幻觉检测方法，通过不确定性估计捕捉高级特征的冲突程度。

Conclusion: 提出的DST方法和PRE-HAL数据集有效提升了视觉幻觉检测能力，为LVLM的可靠性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

*Mubashara Rehman,Niki Martinel,Michele Avanzo,Riccardo Spizzo,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReMAR-DS的深度学习框架，用于减少kVCT成像中的金属伪影，并将其转换为MVCT图像，提升放疗规划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: kVCT成像中的伪影影响图像质量，进而影响临床决策。传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，结合特征重校准技术，专注于伪影区域和关键解剖结构，生成高质量的MVCT样重建图像。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证，模型能有效减少伪影并保留解剖结构，减少患者的高剂量MVCT扫描需求。

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS框架为临床提供了高质量的MVCT样图像，减少辐射暴露，提升放疗规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

*Yuanhe Tian,Lei Mao,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的CT报告生成方法，通过循环视觉特征提取和立体注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用CT切片间的关联和多层次特征，特别是特定器官病变信息，影响了报告生成的准确性。

Method: 使用视觉Transformer循环处理CT切片，并通过多视角注意力机制选择重要视觉信息，与文本特征对齐，指导LLM生成报告。

Result: 在M3D-Cap数据集上超越了基线模型，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合了CT切片的多层次特征，显著提升了报告生成的准确性和效果。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种检测和识别人脸识别系统中自然触发后门攻击的新方法，效果优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击对高安全性应用中的人脸识别系统构成严重威胁，需要有效检测和识别方法。

Method: 开发了一种新技术，用于检测后门攻击并识别自然触发模式。

Result: 在受攻击的人脸识别网络中，识别触发器的Top-5准确率达到74%，优于基线56%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和识别后门攻击中的自然触发器，提升系统安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决在医学数据上是否应预训练定制基础模型，以及是否需要新方法的问题。

Method: 采用DINOv2方法预训练模型，并在三个胎儿超声数据集上进行分类、分割和小样本任务测试。

Result: 结果表明，定制数据预训练效果优于通用模型，且无需超参数调整或方法创新。

Conclusion: 结论指出，在资源有限的情况下，应避免过度追求方法创新，专注于定制数据预训练。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨状态空间模型（SSMs）在2D视觉数据中的适应性，并提出更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用分层设计的Gated CNN块和FFG模块，结合频域操作捕获全局信息。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上达到SOTA性能，参数更少但效果更优。

Conclusion: MambaOutRS提供了一种高效的高性能深度学习范式，适用于计算效率优先的视觉任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常针对单一传感器或固定组合，限制了跨传感器数据的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: SMARTIES通过将异构传感器数据投影到共享频谱感知空间，并使用统一的Transformer模型重建掩码多传感器数据，实现传感器无关的特征表示。

Result: SMARTIES在单模态和多模态任务中均优于依赖传感器特定预训练的模型。

Conclusion: SMARTIES为灵活的多传感器遥感数据处理提供了通用解决方案，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Motivation: 云覆盖导致多光谱图像数据缺失或损坏，影响早期作物测绘，而SAR数据虽不受云干扰但光谱信息不足。

Method: 利用时间序列多光谱图像和SAR数据的互补信息，通过Vision Transformer的注意力机制重建云覆盖区域的多光谱图像。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列多光谱和SAR数据或时间序列多光谱数据的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升云覆盖区域多光谱图像的重建质量。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,

both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning

VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field
of scene understanding involving people.

Conclusion: ScaleCap有效提升了图像描述的质量和多样性，为多模态任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟和长上下文视频理解中表现优异，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Motivation: 处理大规模地球观测数据集时，传统方法难以应对其快速增长的数据量，需要一种高效且易于使用的压缩方案。

Method: 利用ffmpeg中的标准视频编解码器，将多通道时空数据集编码为视频，实现高压缩比和高保真度。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上测试，压缩比高达250倍，PSNR表现优异，且不影响下游深度学习任务性能。

Conclusion: xarrayvideo为地球科学社区提供了一种高效、实用的压缩解决方案，适用于处理大规模地球观测数据。

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

Motivation: 解决SAM2在医学图像分割中依赖人工提示和领域偏移的问题。

Method: 提出支持集引导提示（SGP）框架，包括伪掩码生成（PMG）模块和伪掩码注意力（PMA）模块，并采用低秩适应（LoRA）策略。

Result: 在多种医学影像模态上显著优于现有模型（如nnUNet、SwinUNet、SAM2和MedSAM2）。

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的关键问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation

TL;DR: PathLUPI利用转录组特权信息训练，从全切片图像中提取基因组锚定的组织学嵌入，显著提升了分子预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要准确的分子信息，但直接从基因组学获取成本高且耗时，限制了临床应用。

Method: PathLUPI在训练中利用转录组特权信息，生成基因组锚定的组织学嵌入，仅需全切片图像即可进行推理。

Result: 在49项分子肿瘤学任务中，PathLUPI表现优于传统方法，14项任务AUC≥0.80，5种主要癌症类型的生存队列C-index≥0.70。

Conclusion: PathLUPI通过编码分子上下文优化全切片图像表征，为临床病理工作流程提供了新策略。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学超声图像解读的挑战，特别是针对非专业用户（如即时医疗场景）的需求，提升图像的易懂性和扫描指导。

Method: 引入超声图像场景图（SG），通过变压器模型计算SG，无需显式目标检测；利用LLMs根据用户查询细化SG，生成易懂的图像解释；探索SG在扫描指导中的应用。

Result: 在五名志愿者的颈部区域（包括颈动脉和甲状腺）图像上验证了方法的有效性，证明其能提升超声的解读性和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望通过提升超声图像的易懂性和扫描指导能力，使超声技术更广泛地普及。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

Motivation: 医学图像中精确的异常检测对临床决策至关重要，但现有方法在细粒度区分和设备差异方面表现不足。

Method: UltraAD结合视觉原型和可学习文本嵌入，通过图像级和块级令牌融合优化定位性能，并利用记忆库进行细粒度分类。

Result: 在三个乳腺超声数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraAD在异常定位和细粒度分类方面具有显著优势，代码将在接受后发布。

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 双球模型在鱼眼图像中表现最佳，提出的启发式方法能提升预测质量。新数据集FISHnCHIPS支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Motivation: 现有4D合成方法局限于对象级生成或有限视角的动态场景，无法实现多视角一致和沉浸式动态4D场景。

Method: CoCo4D将4D场景合成分为动态前景和背景建模，通过参考运动序列指导生成，采用渐进式外推方案优化前景轨迹。

Result: 实验表明CoCo4D在4D场景生成中表现优异，实现了真实且连贯的动态效果。

Conclusion: CoCo4D有效解决了现有方法的限制，为动态4D场景生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

Motivation: 现有原型网络依赖多个原型协作决策，而ProtoSolo旨在通过单原型激活完成分类，并提供更简单的解释。

Method: 采用基于特征的比较方法，使用特征图而非全通道特征向量进行相似性比较和原型学习，并提出非原型投影学习策略。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和Stanford Cars数据集上，ProtoSolo在分类任务中表现优异，解释的认知复杂度达到最佳水平。

Conclusion: ProtoSolo通过单原型激活和特征图比较，实现了高效且易解释的图像分类。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证了各设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 为级联视频超分辨率生成建立了简单有效的基线，为未来高效合成系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

Motivation: 高维视觉内容生成计算量大，现有方法多采用复杂多阶段架构，增加了实现难度。

Method: DFM在用户定义的多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每个层级上独立应用Flow Matching。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k 512px上，DFM的FDD分数比基础架构提升35.2%，比最佳基线提升26.4%，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: DFM通过单一模型和简单架构实现了高效生成，且对现有训练流程改动极小。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Conclusion: GenHSI首次实现了无需训练、相机姿态一致的长视频生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

Motivation: 现有方法（如FisheRF和ActiveNeRF）在3D空间中最小化不确定性或最大化信息增益来选择视图，但需要针对不同3D表示进行专门设计且建模复杂。

Method: 将问题重新定义为2D图像质量评估任务，训练一个模型在多视图设置中预测SSIM，并以此指导视图选择。

Result: 方法在标准基准测试中实现了显著的定量和定性改进，且与3D表示无关，运行速度比现有方法快14-33倍。

Conclusion: 通过2D IQA框架，该方法在视图选择中实现了高效且通用的解决方案，避免了3D建模的复杂性。

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel

and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate

Conclusion: AnimaX为类别无关的3D动画提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Radial Attention的稀疏注意力机制，通过模拟时空能量衰减现象，显著降低了视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型在长视频生成中计算成本过高，作者发现时空注意力分数随距离衰减的现象，并利用这一现象提出更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出Radial Attention，一种复杂度为O(n log n)的稀疏注意力机制，通过静态注意力掩码实现空间和时间上的衰减计算密度。

Result: 实验表明，Radial Attention在多个数据集上保持视频质量，计算速度提升1.9倍，训练成本降低4.4倍，推理速度提升3.7倍。

Conclusion: Radial Attention是一种高效且可扩展的注意力机制，显著提升了视频扩散模型的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自治代理如何通过通信信号形成文化，并研究这种文化对代理群体效率和合作的影响。

Method: 使用NEC-DAC系统，每个代理配备神经网络进行决策，研究代理如何通过学习和信号传递形成共享行为系统，并分析不同社会结构（如权威层级）的影响。

Result: 研究发现合作文化显著影响代理群体的表现，信号不仅促进文化涌现，还支持文化在代理世代间的传递。

Conclusion: 自治代理通过通信信号能够形成高效的合作文化，且社会结构对文化的发展和传播具有重要影响。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在战略随机化方面的表现，提出了一种基于田忌赛马的新型零和游戏，并通过实验评估了不同LLMs的战略推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略随机化是博弈论的核心概念，但在LLMs中研究不足。现有研究常混淆随机化的认知决策与随机生成的机械过程，导致评估不完整。

Method: 设计了一个基于田忌赛马的新型零和游戏，其纳什均衡对应最大熵策略。通过多轮竞技游戏，评估五种LLMs在不同提示风格下的表现。

Result: 较弱模型无论提示如何均保持确定性，而较强模型在明确提示下表现出更多随机化。强模型面对弱模型时采用确定性策略，面对同类时则趋向均衡策略。

Conclusion: LLMs的战略推理能力存在显著差异，凸显了抽象推理和自适应学习的改进空间。研究代码已公开以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨LRMs性能崩溃的根本原因，挑战其认知限制的结论，提出性能崩溃源于实验设计而非模型能力。

Result: 工具使用显著提升模型性能，解决之前无法完成的任务，揭示代理推理的层次性。

Conclusion: LRMs的性能崩溃是接口限制而非推理能力问题，工具使用能显著提升表现，重新定义机器智能的衡量标准。

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TabPFN在小到中型表格数据中的表现，特别是在次国家级产量预测任务中的实用性。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型，结合EO和天气数据，通过留一年交叉验证评估模型性能，并与6种ML模型和3种基线模型对比。

Result: TabPFN与ML模型精度相当，但调优更快且特征工程需求低，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TabPFN因其高效和易用性，更适合实际产量预测应用。

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在2D解谜游戏《Baba is You》中的表现，发现尽管LLMs在语言任务上表现优异，但在动态规则变化的推理任务中仍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在结合语言能力和推理能力的任务（如动态规则变化的解谜游戏）中的表现，以评估其复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 评估了六种LLMs在不同提示类型下的表现，并对两种模型（Mistral、OLMo）进行了微调，使用游戏中的文本和结构数据。

Result: 大型模型（如GPT-4o）表现较好，但未适应的小模型难以识别游戏机制或应用规则变化；微调提升了游戏分析能力，但对解决方案的生成帮助有限。

Conclusion: 即使是先进或微调的LLMs，理解动态规则变化（尤其是使用与提及的区分）仍具挑战性，游戏可作为测试LLMs推理能力的有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康支持系统仅基于用户当前情绪和情境生成回应，无法满足深层情感需求。

Method: 整合《薄伽梵歌》精神智慧与GPT-4o，创建GITes数据集，并提出Spiritual Insight指标评估精神相关性。

Result: 最佳模型Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct在ROUGE、METEOR、BERT分数等指标上显著提升，精神洞察力增加15.92%。

Conclusion: 结合精神智慧的AI系统在情感支持中潜力巨大，需进一步验证实际效果。

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

Conclusion: 系统展示了在可计算的自我调节群体中，对抗性认知压力可以产生可验证的知识。

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

Motivation: 传统图粗化方法主要基于谱保持视角，忽略了图的多粒度特性，导致粗化效果不佳。

Method: GBGC引入自适应粒度球图细化机制，将原始图从粗到细分割为不同大小的粒度球，并以这些球为超节点构建粗化图。

Result: GBGC的处理速度比其他方法快数十至数百倍，时间复杂度更低，且粗化图的准确性通常高于原始图。

Conclusion: GBGC因其鲁棒性和泛化能力，有望成为标准的图数据预处理方法。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统中的“过滤气泡”、外部知识利用不足以及模型优化与业务策略迭代脱节的问题。

Method: 1. 将用户数据和项目属性转化为LLM可理解的自然语言提示；2. 两阶段训练：SFT和GRPO（结合CoT机制）。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上，RecLLM-R1在准确性、多样性和新颖性等指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1有效缓解过滤气泡效应，为复杂业务目标下的推荐模型与策略优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

Conclusion: 自动化数据整理流程显著提升了数据集规模和模型性能，为未来研究提供了新的基准和工具。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

Conclusion: FEAT框架在保证质量的同时显著降低了教师反馈生成的成本。

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG是一种新型框架，通过动态意图转移图和双检索机制，显著提升多轮客服对话的上下文连贯性和目标导向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话系统在多轮客服对话中难以同时保持上下文连贯和目标导向的问题。

Method: 构建动态意图转移图，结合意图图遍历和语义搜索的双检索机制。

Result: 在真实客服对话实验中，CID-GraphRAG在自动指标和LLM评估中均显著优于基线方法，如BLEU提升11%，响应质量提升58%。

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG通过意图转移结构与语义检索的协同效应，有效解决了知识密集型多轮对话的挑战。

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

Result: OCR方法在复杂场景中表现更优，而现有方法在困难场景中容易失败。

Conclusion: OCR方法有助于克服复杂场景中的挑战，展示了其在机器人操作任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多NLP任务中表现出色，但在讽刺理解任务上表现不佳。本文旨在通过模块化框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Commander-GPT框架，利用多个专门化的LLM代理（如上下文建模、情感分析等），并通过三种集中式指挥官协调任务。

Result: 在MMSD和MMSD 2.0基准测试中，F1分数平均提升4.4%和11.7%，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Commander-GPT通过模块化设计和多代理协调，显著提升了多模态讽刺理解的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: NaviAgent是一种基于图导航的双层规划架构，通过多路径决策器和图编码导航器，显著提升了LLM在复杂工具链调用中的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂工具链调用中存在单路径执行、错误恢复能力差和搜索空间爆炸的问题，限制了LLM的实用性。

Method: NaviAgent采用双层规划架构，包括动态选择最优动作的多路径决策器和融合API结构与历史行为的图编码导航器。

Result: 实验显示，NaviAgent在任务成功率上显著优于基线方法（如ReAct、ToolLLM等），并在效率和质量上取得平衡。

Conclusion: NaviAgent通过图导航和动态规划，有效解决了复杂工具链调用中的问题，为LLM的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决D&D中手动平衡战斗遭遇的复杂性，避免打断叙事流程。

Method: 将问题建模为上下文赌博机，基于实时队伍属性生成战斗遭遇。

Result: 延长战斗时间（+200%），减少队伍战后生命值（-16.67%），提升战术深度，同时保持高胜率（70%）。

Conclusion: NTRL在提升战斗难度和策略性的同时，优于人工设计的遭遇，保持游戏公平性。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗）中，高性能的机器学习模型往往缺乏可解释性，而符号方法虽可解释但预测能力不足，因此需要结合两者优势。

Method: 采用FOLD-R++算法生成可解释规则，与黑盒机器学习模型结合，选择性修正不确定预测并提供解释。

Result: 在五个医疗数据集上的实验显示，该方法显著提升了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理与机器学习可在保持高准确性的同时提升模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: TAPAS展示了动态生成计划和适应新约束的能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ChordPrompt框架，通过跨模态提示和多域自适应文本提示，解决了持续学习中视觉语言模型在多域任务增量学习中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法主要关注类增量学习，缺乏多域任务增量学习的策略，且多采用单模态提示，忽略了跨模态信息交换的潜力。

Method: 提出ChordPrompt框架，引入跨模态提示和域自适应文本提示，以优化视觉与文本信息的交互。

Result: 在多域增量学习基准测试中，ChordPrompt在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt通过跨模态和域自适应提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在多域持续学习中的表现。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Conclusion: ISLs是克服当前科学发现限制、实现AI驱动科学潜力的关键。

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界中高维和循环因果关系的需求促使研究部分指定的因果表示，如C-DMGs。

Method: 通过输入-输出结构因果模型（ioSCMs）和DMGs，研究C-DMGs中的宏观因果效应识别。

Result: 证明do-calculus在DMGs上的C-DMGs中无条件完备，并扩展了非可识别性标准。

Conclusion: 研究为高维和循环因果系统的宏观效应识别提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Method: 训练一个Transformer模型在分布式的规划任务中进行上下文强化学习，并分析其学习算法。

Result: 模型的学习策略不支持传统的无模型或基于模型的规划，而是通过缓存中间计算来支持灵活的决策。

Conclusion: 记忆可能作为一种计算资源存储经验和计算，支持快速适应，模型的计算与大脑中的海马-内嗅系统相似。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习在预测性维护（PdM）中的应用日益增多，但模型不确定性限制了工业界的广泛采用。本文旨在解决预测误差对维护决策的影响。

Method: 提出IEO框架，通过联合优化预测模型和维护目标，开发了一种适用于小规模数据的随机扰动梯度下降算法。

Result: 实证研究表明，IEO框架将平均维护遗憾降低了22%，显著提高了决策质量。

Conclusion: IEO框架通过将预测模型训练与维护目标对齐，提高了在模型不确定性下的鲁棒性和决策质量。

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential

### [116] [From Reproduction to Replication: Evaluating Research Agents with Progressive Code Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19724)
*Gyeongwon James Kim,Alex Wilf,Louis-Philippe Morency,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoExperiment是一个评估AI代理根据自然语言描述实现和运行机器学习实验能力的基准测试，通过调整缺失代码量来测试从部分复现到完全复现的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估AI代理在给定不同代码起点时实现科学想法的基准测试，AutoExperiment填补了这一空白。

Method: 提供研究论文、部分代码掩码和实验命令，要求AI生成缺失代码并在沙盒环境中运行实验。

Result: 随着缺失代码量增加，AI性能迅速下降；动态交互环境的代理表现优于固定环境，单次与多次尝试成功率差距显著。

Conclusion: AutoExperiment为评估AI驱动的科学实验进展提供了新基准，突显了长时程代码生成和自主实验执行的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动提示优化在知识图谱三元组抽取任务中的应用，通过实验评估不同设置，发现优化后的提示能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决手工设计提示的耗时性和脆弱性，探索自动提示优化在三元组抽取任务中的效果。

Method: 采用实验基准测试，评估不同提示策略、LLM、模式复杂性、输入文本长度和多样性、优化指标及数据集的影响，比较了三种自动提示优化工具（DSPy、APE、TextGrad）。

Result: 自动提示优化技术能生成接近人工设计的提示，并在模式复杂性和文本规模增加时显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 自动提示优化是三元组抽取任务中的有效方法，尤其在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于策略引导的强化学习方法（SAGE），通过专家策略和新型奖励机制提升查询重写的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前查询重写方法需要大量监督数据或强化学习探索效率低，因此研究如何通过专家策略和奖励机制改进。

Method: 引入策略自适应生成引擎（SAGE），结合专家策略（如语义扩展和实体消歧）和两种新型奖励机制（SCS和CRS）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最优NDCG@10结果，同时降低推理成本且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 策略引导的强化学习结合精细奖励机制，为信息检索系统提供了可扩展、高效且可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimBelief是一种新的元强化学习框架，通过测量任务信念的相似性来优化稀疏奖励环境中的任务识别和探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境中，传统的Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL方法难以准确重建奖励信号，导致探索效率低下。

Method: 提出SimBelief框架，利用潜在任务信念度量学习相似任务的共同结构，并将其与特定任务信念结合。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的MuJoCo和panda-gym任务中，SimBelief优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SimBelief通过任务信念相似性度量，显著提升了稀疏奖励环境中的任务识别和适应效率。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决慢思维模型（LLMs）因无法准确识别知识边界而导致的严重幻觉问题，同时避免传统强化学习因缺乏对思考过程的事实监督而加剧幻觉。

Method: 提出KnowRL，将基于知识验证的事实性奖励整合到强化学习训练中，引导模型进行基于事实的慢思维。

Result: 在三个幻觉评估数据集和两个推理评估数据集上的实验表明，KnowRL有效减少了幻觉，同时保持了模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: KnowRL通过事实性奖励显著改善了慢思维模型的可靠性，为减少幻觉问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code

TL;DR: 使用视觉语言模型（VLMs）分析图表以识别潜在问题，验证了VLMs在部分数据可视化原则上的有效性，并比较了不同模型和提示策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员常因不了解或不遵循数据可视化原则而生成误导性图表，需自动化工具辅助识别问题。

Method: 比较五种开源VLMs和五种提示策略，通过基于数据可视化指南的问题集评估其性能。

Result: VLMs在分析图表类型、3D效果、坐标轴标签等方面表现良好，但在图像质量和刻度标记上表现不佳；Qwen2.5VL和总结提示策略最优。

Conclusion: VLMs可自动识别图表中的潜在问题，如缺失标签或冗余3D效果，方法可扩展至其他可视化领域。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口拥堵预测对全球供应链的可靠性至关重要，准确的预测可以优化运输计划、减少延误和成本，并增强供应链韧性。

Method: 通过分析历史AIS数据重建泊位调度，利用逆向强化学习（IRL）确定奖励函数，开发了Temporal-IRL模型来预测船舶序列和港口停留时间。

Result: 使用2015年1月至2023年9月的数据训练和测试模型，取得了显著的效果。

Conclusion: Temporal-IRL模型通过学习泊位调度模式，能够有效预测港口拥堵，为供应链管理提供支持。

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

Motivation: 解决多智能体联合进化中的合作效率低和训练不稳定问题。

Method: 采用GRPO进行联合训练，结合蒙特卡洛采样和边际效益驱动选择策略优化模型更新，并引入自适应记忆机制。

Result: 在通用和特定领域场景中，JoyAgents-R1性能接近更大LLM，同时基于较小开源模型。

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1通过高效采样和记忆优化，实现了多智能体的协同进化与性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

Motivation: 现有MSFP综述多局限于单一任务或视角，难以直接惠及相关领域研究者，本文旨在从任务无关角度全面梳理MSFP研究。

Method: 从多模态、多智能体、时间序列和LLM融合等视角系统综述MSFP方法，并探讨开放挑战与未来方向。

Result: 提出了一种更全面的MSFP分类框架，为研究者提供了跨任务的参考和未来研究的启示。

Conclusion: 本文填补了MSFP综述的空白，为跨领域研究提供了新视角，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

Motivation: 社交媒体快速发展导致有害内容传播加剧，现有数据集缺乏系统性、大规模、多样性和高解释性，阻碍了有害模因检测的进展。

Method: 引入MemeMind数据集，具备科学标准、大规模、多样性、双语支持和详细推理注释；提出MemeGuard框架，整合多模态信息和推理建模。

Result: 在MemeMind数据集上的实验表明，MemeGuard在有害模因检测任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind和MemeGuard为有害模因检测提供了更全面的数据和更有效的框架，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正学习推理模式，还是仅通过记忆模拟能力，以提升其可信度和解释性。

Method: 采用新框架评估LLMs在STEM领域的推理能力，分析其记忆与自我知识的关系。

Result: LLMs因记忆解决方案而高估自身推理能力，面对逻辑一致的任务扰动时，可行性评估不一致性超过45%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM架构和训练模式存在缺陷，需改进以确保模型对自身知识的认知一致，增强AI的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型对训练中未见过的非常规分词的鲁棒性，以及这些分词是否能在特定任务中提升性能。

Method: 通过20个基准测试评估指令调优模型在非常规分词（如随机采样和字符级分词）下的性能表现。

Result: 模型在非常规分词下保留高达93.4%的性能，字符级分词在某些任务中提升表现达14%。

Conclusion: 模型对分词器的依赖低于预期，干预推理时的分词策略有望提升性能。

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视长文本偏见和LLM输出的内在变异性，FiSCo旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FiSCo在声明级别操作，利用蕴含检查评估响应一致性，并通过统计假设检验比较群体间和群体内相似性。

Result: 实验表明，FiSCo能更可靠地识别细微偏见，减少LLM随机变异性影响，优于其他评估指标。

Conclusion: FiSCo为LLMs的群体公平性评估提供了更细粒度和可靠的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 职位匹配和技能预测在计算就业市场领域具有重要意义，可提升自动候选人匹配、职业路径预测等任务的效果。

Method: 比较了微调分类、微调对比和提示方法，并利用ESCO的额外数据增强模型。

Result: 任务A中提示方法表现最佳（MAP 0.492），任务B中微调分类方法表现最佳（MAP 0.290）。多语言大模型在两项任务中均表现最优。

Conclusion: 多语言大模型在职位匹配和技能预测任务中表现最佳，提示方法和微调分类方法分别适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

TL;DR: MFTCXplain是一个多语言基准数据集，用于通过仇恨言论多跳解释评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现LLM在道德情感预测和跨文化道德推理方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准缺乏道德分类的透明性和多语言覆盖，限制了LLM在道德推理任务中的表现评估。

Method: 引入MFTCXplain数据集，包含3000条推文，标注仇恨言论标签、道德类别和文本级解释，基于Moral Foundation Theory。

Result: LLM在仇恨言论检测上表现良好（F1达0.836），但在道德情感预测上较弱（F1<0.35），且跨语言解释对齐有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在理解和反映人类道德推理方面能力有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

Motivation: 现有基准可能因预训练数据污染而受限，$	exttt{StorySim}$通过可控的$	exttt{Storyboard}$生成新颖、组合的故事提示，以精确操纵角色视角和事件。

Method: 设计了基于$	exttt{StorySim}$的一阶和二阶ToM任务及WM任务，控制心理状态追踪和建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，多数LLMs在WM任务上表现优于ToM任务，且对人类推理优于无生命对象。还发现启发式行为（如近因偏差和过度依赖早期事件）。

Conclusion: $	exttt{StorySim}$为评估LLMs的ToM和WM能力提供了可控且新颖的框架，揭示了模型的行为模式。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

Result: 实验显示LLMs在简单提示下生成合理解释，但在复杂关系下表现不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs的毒性解释需改进以增强可信度，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

Method: 联合训练语音和文本输入模态，统一内部表示，支持基于文本的领域适应。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上WER降低5.8~12.8%，在两个外域数据集上分别降低15.3%和17.8%。

Conclusion: J-TAED成功整合语音和语言信息，有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升跨领域性能。

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高资源语言中表现良好，但在低资源语言中表现不佳，需要研究如何跨语言适应上下文学习。

Method: 研究覆盖五种目标语言、三种基础LLM和七种下游任务，比较了少样本提示、翻译测试、微调等适应技术。

Result: 少样本提示和翻译测试显著优于梯度调整方法，性能下降归因于灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 这是针对低资源语言上下文学习的最大规模研究，提供了数据集和模型供公开使用。

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统主要使用自然语言通信，导致信息损失，尤其是在传递推理逻辑或抽象思维时。

Method: 提出State Delta Encoding (SDE)方法，传递标记级状态转移轨迹，以捕捉推理过程中的隐藏信息。

Result: 实验表明，使用SDE的多智能体系统在复杂推理任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SDE展示了通信增强在LLM多智能体系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial

enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Result: G-SAE在毒性检测、写作风格识别和隐私属性识别等任务中表现出更高的单义性和更精细的控制能力，且质量下降较少。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM的机制可解释性和控制提供了实用指南。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上评估，VeilProbe在黑盒设置中表现优越且有效。

Conclusion: VeilProbe为黑盒环境下的预训练文本检测提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs在分歧建模中的评估与性能。

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Conclusion: 文章旨在为LLM在教育中的应用提供理论和实践指导，使其更符合教育原则。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型（LRMs）在高效推理策略下可能引发行为不一致问题，包括自相矛盾、事后合理化等，需进一步研究其潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高效推理策略是否会导致模型行为不一致，从而影响模型的可信度和监督有效性。

Method: 引入ICBENCH基准，从三个维度（任务设置、训练目标与学习行为、内部推理与自我解释）评估LRMs的不一致性。

Result: 高效推理策略（如No-Thinking和Simple Token-Budget）显著增加不一致性，且大模型虽更一致但仍存在广泛问题。

Conclusion: 高效推理虽提升效率，但可能引入行为不一致风险，需深入研究其影响。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

Motivation: 减少KV缓存在LLMs中的内存占用，同时最小化超低比特量化带来的性能下降。

Method: 提出锚点分数（AnS）量化KV缓存的敏感性，设计AnTKV框架和兼容FlashAttention的Triton内核。

Result: AnTKV在4比特设置下优于现有方法，支持840K上下文长度，解码吞吐量提升3.5倍，1比特和0.375比特下困惑度显著降低。

Conclusion: AnTKV通过锚点感知量化有效平衡了内存占用和性能，适用于超低比特量化场景。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了NERL的结构精确性和LLM的语义处理能力，为临床提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,

Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is

information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MT评估能力的限制，呼吁关注如何可靠衡量MT评估的进步。

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

Conclusion: 多模态方法能有效检测仇恨传播者，提升对隐晦信息的分类，并为干预措施提供依据。

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a
specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the
structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability
across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and
efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

TL;DR: RPT能提升LLMs的推理能力，但其改进的泛化性有限，尤其是在不同推理模式的新领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RPT在不同领域的泛化能力，尤其是未在微调数据中出现的新领域。

Method: 通过观察性研究（比较RPT模型与基础模型）和干预性研究（单领域微调后多领域评估）分析RPT的泛化性。

Result: RPT在类似微调数据的任务上表现显著提升，但在不同推理模式的领域上泛化不一致甚至失效。

Conclusion: RPT的改进泛化性有限，需进一步研究以提升其跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

*Takashi Nishibayashi,Seiji Kanazawa,Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于合成病例模拟的方法，利用HPO数据库评估症状检查器算法更新对罕见疾病诊断性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见疾病评估数据不足的问题，避免手动创建病例的高成本和不切实际性。

Method: 利用HPO数据库生成合成病例，模拟症状检查器访谈，通过R²系数验证方法有效性。

Result: 对于有频率信息的疾病，R²值较高（召回率0.831，精确率0.78），表明方法能有效预测性能变化；无频率信息的疾病预测误差较大。

Conclusion: 该方法透明且低成本，可帮助开发者在部署前评估算法更新对罕见疾病诊断性能的影响，支持早期诊断。

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量网络文本以扩充预训练数据，实验证明其能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本的稀缺性。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写被过滤的低质量文本生成合成数据。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量原始文本与改写文本分别提升1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Abstract: The Arabic language is among the most popular languages in the world with a
huge variety of dialects spoken in 22 countries. In this study, we address the
problem of classifying 18 Arabic dialects of the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.
RNN models, Transformer models, and large language models (LLMs) via prompt
engineering are created and tested. Among these, MARBERTv2 performed best with

preprocessing techniques and the latest NLP models, this paper identifies the
most significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The
results corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in
users' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic
communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于线性复杂度循环注意力（RA）层的长语音识别方法，解决了传统多头注意力（MHA）因二次复杂度不适用于长语音的问题。RA在短语音和长语音任务中均能达到MHA的精度，且更高效。通过长语音训练范式和方向丢弃（Direction Dropout）正则化方法，进一步提升了RA的性能和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力（MHA）在长语音识别中因二次复杂度效率低下，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用线性复杂度的双向循环注意力（RA）层，提出长语音训练范式和方向丢弃（Direction Dropout）正则化方法。

Result: RA在精度上与MHA相当，但更高效；长语音训练范式使RA的吞吐量提升44%；方向丢弃进一步优化了精度与吞吐量的权衡。

Conclusion: RA层是一种高效且精确的长语音识别解决方案，方向丢弃提供了灵活的精度与效率控制。

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中取得了显著进展，但如何最优整合SFT和RL仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析标记分布和学习动态，提出SRFT方法，结合SFT和RL，利用熵感知加权机制直接优化LLM。

Result: SRFT在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率达到59.1%，比零RL方法高出9.0%。

Conclusion: SRFT通过统一SFT和RL，显著提升了LLM在推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 网络仇恨言论的传播加剧了社区暴力，威胁社会和谐，但相关文本分类研究不足。

Method: 采用微调的BanglaBERT模型，并通过扩展数据集（增加1,794条实例）开发集成模型。使用LIME工具分析模型决策。

Result: 集成模型F1分数达0.63，优于单模型（0.60）。定性分析显示模型在上下文理解上仍有局限。

Conclusion: 研究展示了NLP和可解释性工具在减少网络社区暴力中的潜力，为未来改进技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

Conclusion: MAM框架为医疗诊断提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Motivation: 研究动机是澄清猕猴和人类弓状束（AF）的组织和连接差异，以理解人类语言网络的进化基础及其相关疾病的神经解剖学机制。

Method: 方法包括猕猴的跨尺度单神经元追踪（病毒标记和荧光显微断层扫描）和11.7T扩散MRI全脑追踪，辅以人类的7.0T MRI谱嵌入分析，进行跨物种比较连接组分析。

Result: 结果显示猕猴AF起源于颞顶皮层，穿过听觉皮层和顶叶岛盖，投射到前额叶区域；而人类AF在颞中回扩展更广，前额叶和顶叶岛盖连接更强，这些差异可能支持人类语言网络的进化。

Conclusion: 结论指出人类AF更广泛的颞叶整合和强化的额顶连接可能是高级语言处理的神经基础，并为AF相关疾病（如失语症和阅读障碍）提供了理解框架。

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman
primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges
from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -
using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning
tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain
tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding
analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis
of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the
temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,
and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits
greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and
parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler
analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language
networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader
temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a
connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing
unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework
for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where
aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of

TL;DR: AnchorDP3是一种用于双臂机器人操作的扩散策略框架，通过三项创新技术在高度随机化环境中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高度随机化环境中机器人操作的挑战，提升任务成功率和学习效率。

Method: 结合模拟器监督语义分割、任务条件特征编码器和基于关键姿态的扩散策略，简化预测空间并提升几何一致性。

Result: 在RoboTwin基准测试中达到98.7%的平均成功率，适应极端随机化环境。

Conclusion: AnchorDP3框架有望实现仅通过场景和指令生成可部署的视觉运动策略，无需人类示范。

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

TL;DR: CronusVLA扩展单帧视觉语言动作模型至多帧范式，通过高效后训练阶段提升性能，减少计算冗余，并在多个任务中取得最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言动作模型受限于单帧观察，无法充分利用多帧历史信息，计算成本高且延迟大。

Method: 1. 单帧预训练；2. 多帧编码，将动作标记预测转为运动特征；3. 跨帧解码，通过交叉注意力映射特征块到动作。

Result: 在SimperEnv上成功率70.9%，LIBERO上比OpenVLA提升12.7%，实际机器人实验表现优异。

Conclusion: CronusVLA通过高效多帧处理显著提升模型性能，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world
Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments such as
indoor parking structures or dense urban canyons, achieving accurate and robust
vehicle positioning remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
cost-effective, vision-based multi-sensor navigation system that integrates
monocular depth estimation, semantic filtering, and visual map registration
(VMR) with 3-D digital maps. Extensive testing in real-world indoor and outdoor
driving scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system,
achieving sub-meter accuracy of 92% indoors and more than 80% outdoors, with
consistent horizontal positioning and heading average root mean-square errors
of approximately 0.98 m and 1.25 {\deg}, respectively. Compared to the
baselines examined, the proposed solution significantly reduced drift and
improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy
improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the
potential of cost-effective monocular vision systems combined with 3D maps for
scalable, GNSS-independent navigation in land vehicles.

improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction
ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site
conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper
provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction
automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.

TL;DR: 该论文调查了美国大学的高性能计算（HPC）资源现状，发现其增长远低于国家和工业界，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和数据密集型科学的快速发展导致对HPC的需求激增，但大学HPC资源相对不足，需要评估和改进。

Method: 调查了50多所顶尖研究机构的HPC能力，包括计算容量、架构设计、治理模式和能源效率。

Result: 大学HPC增长较慢（CAGR≈18%），远低于国家（≈43%）和工业界（≈78%），需采取新策略缩小差距。

Conclusion: 建议通过联合计算、闲置GPU利用和成本分担等模式，实现更公平和可持续的HPC资源分配。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national
research priorities.

Motivation: 大型科学合作项目面临海量数据和计算需求，现有启发式方法效率不足，缺乏动态模型来评估优化方案。

Method: 利用PanDA工作流管理系统的执行记录，分析关键性能指标，并开发生成式AI模型模拟负载时间序列。

Result: 确定了排队时间、错误率和远程数据访问等关键指标，并构建了包含可见和隐藏特征的AI模型。

Conclusion: 该动态模型有望优化数据和工作流管理，为未来科学合作提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) 是一种新的 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 架构，通过层内专家顺序通信提升模型表现和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 MoE 模型中专家并行独立操作，限制了模型的表达能力和灵活性。CoE 旨在通过迭代专家选择和动态路由机制解决这一问题。

Method: CoE 在每层内引入顺序专家链，每个迭代步骤使用专用路由器动态选择专家，支持专家组合的多样性。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CoE 将验证损失从 1.20 降至 1.12，同时通过专家迭代提供新的扩展维度，减少内存使用 17.6-42%。

Conclusion: CoE 通过迭代残差结构和增强的专家专业化，显著提升了模型的表达能力和性能，为模型扩展提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

Motivation: 边缘设备上运行大型语言模型（LLM）的计算和内存需求高，限制了实时应用的发展。现有方法如量化和剪枝在速度和准确性上存在折衷。

Method: HOLA结合分层推测解码（HSD）、自适应检索增强生成（AdaComp-RAG）和混合剪枝量化（LoBi），实现端到端优化。

Result: 在GSM8K和ARC任务上分别提升17.6%和10.5%的性能，同时降低延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: HOLA证明了其在边缘设备上的高效性和生产就绪性，适用于医疗、教育等领域。

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

Result: SPLoRA在安全性和性能上优于现有方法，且降低推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA是一种高效、可扩展的方案，适用于更安全可靠的LLM部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

Result: 发现“思维锚点”的存在，这些锚点对后续推理有显著影响，通常是规划或回溯句子。

Conclusion: 句子级分析为理解推理模型提供了新视角，三种方法的一致性验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

Conclusion: Transformer在多任务训练中表现出内在的奥卡姆剃刀倾向，验证了其行为的理论合理性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

TL;DR: 论文提出Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP)，通过预防异常值形成而非事后缓解，显著提升大语言模型（LLM）的量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中的极端激活异常值严重降低量化性能，阻碍高效设备部署。现有方法难以有效解决此问题。

Method: OSP结合三项创新：Muon优化器、Single-Scale RMSNorm和可学习嵌入投影，从训练阶段预防异常值形成。

Result: 在1.4B参数模型上验证，OSP在4位量化下平均得分35.7（标准模型26.5），训练开销仅增加2%，异常值接近零。

Conclusion: 异常值并非LLM固有特性，而是训练策略的结果。OSP为高效LLM部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning 通过引入步骤级并行性，提升了推理模型的解码速度，将 Token-level SD 的加速比从 1.4x 提升到 2.1x。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型生成长链式思维时解码速度慢，Token-level SD 的加速效果有限，因为长令牌猜测的正确率随长度指数下降。

Method: 利用轻量级草案模型提出多个未来步骤，目标模型批量扩展每个提案，验证器保留语义正确的步骤并重新生成失败的步骤。

Result: 在 GSM8K、AIME 等基准测试中，Lookahead Reasoning 将 SD 的加速比从 1.4x 提升到 2.1x，同时保持答案质量。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning 通过步骤级并行性突破了 Token-level SD 的算法限制，显著提升了推理模型的解码速度。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

Method: 开发了首个基于LLM增强的合成数据生成方法，利用真实世界表格健康数据，提升因果公平性。

Result: 生成的数据在因果公平性指标上偏离真实数据不到10%，训练后的预测器在敏感属性上的偏差减少了70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为健康研究和医疗提供了更公平的合成数据支持，促进了公平性。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFTv2通过输入中心化重构和Cayley-Neumann参数化，显著降低了OFT的计算和内存需求，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFT的高运行时和内存需求限制了其实际应用，因此需要一种更高效的实现方式。

Method: 提出OFTv2，采用输入中心化重构（矩阵-向量乘法）和Cayley-Neumann参数化（近似矩阵逆）。

Result: OFTv2实现了10倍训练速度提升和3倍GPU内存节省，且支持量化模型微调，优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2是一种高效且实用的参数微调方法，适用于大规模模型部署。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

TL;DR: 论文证明了Transformer可以精确实现k-means聚类算法（Lloyd算法），并通过理论和实验验证了这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer是否能学习和实现精确算法，尤其是k-means聚类。

Method: 提出k-means Transformer架构，利用注意力机制和残差连接精确实现Lloyd算法，并通过实验验证。

Result: 成功实现k-means聚类，并展示了架构的可解释性修改能衍生多种聚类变体。

Conclusion: Transformer机制能精确映射算法过程，为在Transformer中实现精确算法提供了清晰视角。

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在联邦学习中，用户数据统计异质性下的隐私保护问题，同时学习共享嵌入和局部表示，以降低风险。

Method: 基于FedRep算法提出隐私保护的联邦学习算法，利用Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换降低维度，适用于噪声标签和子高斯分布。

Conclusion: 在隐私保护和模型个性化方面取得了进展，特别是在更广泛的用户分布和噪声标签下提供了更强的理论保证。

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Conclusion: 全局Lipschitz正则化能有效提升行为克隆策略的鲁棒性，适用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;
Behavior Cloning; Lipschitz Neural Network

Motivation: 交通事故是全球重大死因，准确的事故数据对预防策略和政策制定至关重要。研究旨在解决酒精推断不匹配（AIM）问题，以提高数据质量。

Method: 开发框架结合BERT模型分析37.1万条事故记录，使用Probit Logit模型探究AIM模式的影响因素，并进行地理空间聚类。

Result: 发现24.03%的事故存在AIM，酒精相关致命事故和夜间事故AIM比例较低，而涉及未知车辆类型和老年驾驶者的事故更易出现AIM。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对性培训和数据管理团队的必要性，以提高事故报告的准确性并支持基于证据的政策制定。

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

Conclusion: DGMAE有效保留了节点差异，是图自监督学习的先进方法。

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了因果发现的效果，且标签关系符合常识。

Conclusion: 基于标签的方法比单一类型分配更灵活和稳健，适用于实际因果发现任务。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

Motivation: 尽管MU技术快速发展，但其漏洞尚未充分研究，可能导致隐私泄露。现有攻击研究需要访问原始模型，违背了MU的隐私保护目标。

Method: 采用教师-学生知识蒸馏架构，将未遗忘模型作为噪声标注器，转化为带噪声标签学习（LNL）问题，推断遗忘实例的正确标签。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，MRA策略能高效恢复遗忘实例的类别成员关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来MU漏洞研究提供了基准，揭示了MU技术的潜在隐私风险。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

Result: 在mini-ImageNet和CUB200基准测试中，ConCM性能最优，增量会话的调和准确率分别提升3.20%和3.68%。

Conclusion: ConCM通过几何最优性和最大匹配性，克服了类数量先验的需求，显著提升了FSCIL的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Result: 实验表明，NCT在单次前向传递中实现了最先进的可控生成，质量和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NCT是一种模块化、数据高效且易于部署的方法，显著提升了可控生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，FAF显著优于基线方法，尤其在CO₂排放数据集上提升41.81%。

Conclusion: FAF框架在少样本时间序列预测中表现出色，兼具通用性和个性化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Conclusion: ReCalX通过校准模型提升了基于扰动解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可证明性能的同时，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Method: CAP通过von Mises-Fisher分布在单位超球面上建模权重不确定性，并利用封闭形式的KL散度正则化器优化各层的不确定性水平。

Result: 在CIFAR-10实验中，CAP将预期校准误差降低了5.6倍，同时提供了可解释的逐层不确定性分析。

Conclusion: CAP是一种理论严谨且实用的深度学习方法，显著提升了不确定性量化的效果。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为多扰动Shapley值分析（MSA）的模型无关框架，用于量化神经网络单元对高维输出的贡献，并展示了其在解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法（如SHAP）无法量化神经网络单元对高维输出（如像素、标记或逻辑单元）的贡献，因此需要一种新方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统地扰动单元组合，MSA生成Shapley模式，即与模型输出维度完全一致的单元贡献图。该方法适用于从多层感知器到大型语言模型（如Mixtral-8x7B）和生成对抗网络（GAN）。

Result: MSA揭示了正则化如何将计算集中在少数中心节点中，展示了LLM内部的语言特定专家，并发现了GAN中倒置的像素生成层次结构。

Conclusion: MSA是一种强大的工具，可用于解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过验证梯度直接调整正则化参数的方法，解决了模型正则化中手动调参的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型正则化需要大量手动调参以平衡复杂度和过拟合，而交叉正则化方法通过验证梯度自动调整参数，简化了这一过程。

Method: 该方法将参数优化分为两部分：训练数据指导特征学习，验证数据调整复杂度控制。通过噪声注入在神经网络中实现，展示了高噪声容忍度和架构特定的正则化。

Result: 方法能够收敛到交叉验证最优解，同时与数据增强、不确定性校准和大数据集无缝集成，保持单次运行的高效性。

Conclusion: 交叉正则化不仅解决了正则化参数调优的问题，还揭示了神经网络训练中的新现象，如高噪声容忍度和自适应的正则化模式。

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型如何从训练数据泛化到更广泛部署分布中的行为，是AI安全的重要问题。

Method: 通过微调、强化学习等方法诱导突发性错位，并使用稀疏自编码器进行模型差异分析。

Result: 发现“毒性人格特征”是突发性错位的主要控制因素，少量良性样本微调可有效恢复对齐。

Conclusion: 突发性错位行为可通过内部特征分析理解，并可通过简单干预缓解。

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

Result: 明确了AI安全与AI安全的边界，揭示了其相互影响（如安全漏洞引发安全问题），并提出了研究与管理建议。

Conclusion: 澄清概念边界有助于精准研究方向、跨学科合作、政策制定，最终推动可信AI系统的部署。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical
systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While
its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes
interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to
demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate
these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise
research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,
enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of
trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 大型课堂中学生与教师及学习材料的互动不足，技术发展为利用CAI提升参与度提供了机会。

Method: 在软件工程课程中设计了一项使用ChatGPT的课堂活动，并通过对比实验评估其效果。

Result: 结果显示ChatGPT能有效支持学生在大型课堂中与学习内容的互动。

Conclusion: CAI工具如ChatGPT在提升大型课堂学生参与度方面具有潜力，值得进一步探讨。

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the
implications of our findings.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨LLM在社会模拟中的可靠性问题，提出明确边界以提升其科学价值。

Method: 分析LLM的局限性，提出三个边界问题（对齐性、一致性、鲁棒性），并给出实用检查清单。

Result: 建议LLM模拟应聚焦集体模式、真实平均行为及验证方法，以增强可靠性。

Conclusion: 明确边界和验证方法可提升LLM模拟在社会科学中的价值。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在教育中的应用日益广泛，学生对其（误）使用可能影响学习效果，因此需要一种方法引导学生正确使用LLM。

Method: 研究首先提出“教学提示”概念，并通过调查教师（N=36）需求设计了一个交互式学习系统，随后通过用户研究（N=22）评估其效果。

Result: 结果显示，学生在LLM教学提示技能上有显著提升，并对系统持积极态度，未来更愿意使用教学提示。

Conclusion: 研究贡献包括理论框架、教师态度实证数据及有效的学习干预设计，具有广泛推广潜力。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统因封闭设计缺乏定制化，无法全面支持残障用户，导致他们在数字环境中遇到障碍。

Method: MATE基于用户需求进行模态转换，支持从LLM API调用到自定义ML分类器的多种模型，并引入ModCon-Task-Identifier模型精确提取转换任务。

Result: 实验表明ModCon-Task-Identifier在自定义数据上优于其他LLM和统计模型。

Conclusion: MATE是一个灵活、隐私安全的系统，适用于多个领域，能有效辅助残障用户。

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

Result: 在四个不同测试集上验证，NEAR²在较小嵌入维度下优于现有模型。

Conclusion: NEAR²方法在效率和准确性上均表现出色，为电子商务信息检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型（DM）的公平生成序列推荐模型FairGENRec，旨在解决推荐系统中的公平性问题，同时提升多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，推荐系统容易因用户行为模式与敏感特征（如性别、年龄）的强相关性而导致不公平。扩散模型因其对不确定性和多样性的建模能力，适合用于公平推荐。

Method: 在训练阶段，通过敏感特征识别模型注入随机噪声，并设计序列去噪模型进行反向重构；在推理阶段，利用历史交互生成噪声并反向迭代重构目标项表示。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FairGENRec在准确性和公平性上均有提升，并通过案例统计可视化公平性改进程度。

Conclusion: FairGENRec通过扩散模型有效建模推荐公平性，同时增强多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

TL;DR: MoLE是一种平衡效率与专业化的多语言编程架构，通过共享和语言特定的LoRA模块实现高效知识共享与专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言编程中单一模型效率低与多模型计算成本高的问题。

Result: MoLE在参数效率上优于单独训练的语言特定LoRA，同时在准确性上超过单一共享模型。

Conclusion: MoLE在多语言编程任务中实现了效率与专业化的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

minimizing a specified cost. In this paper we review recent advances in
estimating and developing limit theorems for the OT map, using samples from the
underlying distributions. We also review parallel lines of work that establish
similar results for special cases and variants of the basic OT setup. We
conclude with a discussion of key directions for future research with the goal
of providing practitioners with reliable inferential tools.

### [220] [From High-SNR Radar Signal to ECG: A Transfer Learning Model with Cardio-Focusing Algorithm for Scenarios with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19358)
*Yuanyuan Zhang,Haocheng Zhao,Sijie Xiong,Rui Yang,Eng Gee Lim,Yutao Yue*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于雷达信号的心电图（ECG）恢复方法，适用于数据稀缺的新场景，通过心脏定位算法（CFT）和迁移学习模型（RFcardi）实现高效恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有雷达信号恢复ECG的方法依赖高质量信号和大量训练数据，限制了在新场景中的应用。

Method: 提出CFT算法精确定位心脏位置，确保高质量信号采集；设计RFcardi模型，利用心脏特征稀疏性，无需ECG标注数据，仅需少量同步数据微调模型。

Result: CFT能动态识别心脏位置，RFcardi模型通过少量训练数据即可生成准确的ECG恢复结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺场景下有效，为雷达信号恢复ECG提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非等变模型因缺乏等变偏置而需要大模型规模的问题，探索位置编码在分子构象生成中的潜力。

Method: 采用相对位置编码（类似ALiBi技术），将其作为负注意力偏置，根据图中节点间的最短路径距离线性增加。

Result: 在GEOM-DRUGS基准测试中，25M参数的模型超越了64M参数的当前最佳非等变模型。

Conclusion: 优化的位置编码可有效弥补非等变模型的规模限制，为分子构象生成提供新思路。

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area
of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models
(LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for
end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating
NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research
has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we
present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate
NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing
Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of
codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper
demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and
employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at

Motivation: 随着深度学习在医疗影像中的应用，许多公司部署了专有模型以提供商业化服务。尽管模型权重被隐藏以保护知识产权，但这些模型仍面临模型窃取攻击的风险。目前，医疗影像模型对此类攻击的脆弱性尚未充分研究。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为QueryWise的两步模型窃取方法，利用公开数据集和代理分布的无标签数据，在有限查询预算下高效克隆目标模型。

Result: 实验表明，QueryWise方法在胆囊癌和COVID-19分类任务中能够有效窃取模型功能。

Conclusion: 医疗影像模型在现实条件下对模型窃取攻击具有显著脆弱性，QueryWise方法为攻击者提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声感知自注意力方法，用于改进卷积去噪自编码器在牙科X光图像中恢复高频细节的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积去噪自编码器在恢复高频细节（如牙科X光中的细微结构）时表现不佳，而常规注意力机制可能忽略噪声区域的关键特征。

Method: 提出噪声感知自注意力方法，并基于此构建噪声感知注意力增强去噪自编码器（NAADA）。

Result: 与现有方法（如Uformer、MResDNN）相比，NAADA在恢复细节和提升图像质量方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 噪声感知自注意力方法有效提升了牙科X光图像的去噪效果，尤其在高频细节恢复方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X射线（CXRs）作为最常用的医学成像方式，其2D投影图像因结构叠加而限制了精确诊断和风险预测的效果。

Method: Xray2Xray通过视觉模型和过渡模型，从不同角度位置的X射线投影中学习潜在表示，用于下游任务如风险预测和疾病诊断。

Result: 实验表明，Xray2Xray在心血管疾病风险估计上优于监督方法和自监督预训练方法，并在五种病理分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: Xray2Xray的潜在表示可用于重建体积上下文，为医学影像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for
decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary,
often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both
pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation
computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this
problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein
tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants
each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the
performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation
could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied
training data

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EASR-DCN的新方法，通过有效表示和独立对齐ROI来改进可变形医学图像配准（DMIR），无需依赖标签约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的DMIR方法存在局限性：无监督方法忽略ROI表示，弱监督方法依赖标签约束。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型进行强度分析表示ROI，提出Divide-and-Conquer Network（DCN）独立对齐ROI。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，EASR-DCN在Dice分数上显著优于VoxelMorph。

Conclusion: EASR-DCN在精度和变形减少方面表现出色，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,
such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and
repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection
algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over
20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive
experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and
synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments
investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a
detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a
comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for
digital pathology images.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在编码效率和灵活性上表现优异，适应多样化应用需求。

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more
accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为监督解剖预训练（SAP）的方法，用于解决全身MRI中转移性骨病（MBD）分割的挑战性问题。该方法通过从有限的解剖标签数据中学习，显著优于基线方法和自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于转移性骨病（MBD）在全身MRI中的表现多样、边界模糊且类别不平衡，获取可靠的分割结果需要大量高质量标注数据。然而，生成这样的数据集耗时且容易出错。自监督学习（SSL）虽然可以利用未标注数据，但其通用表示难以捕捉病灶的细微特征。

Method: 提出SAP方法，首先基于健康个体的全身MRI扫描训练骨骼分割模型，然后将其用于转移性前列腺癌患者的MBD分割任务，并与基线随机初始化和SSL方法进行比较。

Result: SAP方法在归一化表面Dice系数（0.76）和Dice系数（0.64）上显著优于基线（0.24）和SSL（0.31）。对于大于1毫升的临床相关病灶，SAP在28/32患者中达到100%的检测灵敏度。

Conclusion: 通过从解剖学中学习骨骼形态，SAP方法为骨病灶分割任务提供了有效的领域相关归纳偏置，显著提升了分割性能。所有代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度正弦图恢复网络，用于填补稀疏PET扫描仪缺失的数据，通过改进的Residual U-Net实现，效果优于传统插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长轴PET扫描仪因高成本光电探测器而临床使用受限的问题，探索稀疏探测器配置的可行性。

Method: 使用改进的Residual U-Net，基于GE Signa PET/MR的临床扫描数据训练，模拟移除50%探测器（保留25%响应线）。

Result: 模型成功恢复缺失计数，平均绝对误差低于每像素两个事件，但重建图像在细节上缺乏锐度。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测器配置结合深度学习是传统PET设计的可行替代方案，有助于开发低成本全身PET扫描仪。

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D CNN方法未能利用切片间的解剖连续性，而3D模型需要大量标注数据，临床实用性受限。

Method: 使用预训练的DeepLabV3提取单切片特征，结合ConvLSTM层跨切片整合信息，实现上下文感知分割。

Result: 在PROMISE12基准测试中，优于现有2D和3D模型，精度、召回率、IoU和DSC均显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限和噪声条件下表现稳健，具有临床部署潜力。

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its
potential for robust clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT重建因X射线投影数量有限而成为不适定问题，现有NeRF方法因哈希编码器与神经网络的局部-全局训练不匹配导致特征不一致、训练不稳定和重建质量下降。

Method: 引入归一化哈希编码器增强特征一致性，并提出MCI策略通过预训练模型初始化神经网络，提升早期训练稳定性。

Result: 在128个CT案例上验证，方法显著提升训练效率和重建性能，覆盖7种不同解剖区域。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，仅需少量代码修改即可显著改善CBCT重建的训练稳定性和质量。

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确分割MRI中的垂体腺瘤和腺体对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有方法在性能上存在差异，需系统评估以指导未来研究。

Method: 回顾了34项采用自动和半自动分割方法的研究，提取并分析了分割技术和性能指标（如Dice分数）。

Result: 深度学习方法（尤其是U-Net）最常用，自动分割的Dice分数为0.19--89.00%（腺体）和4.60--96.41%（腺瘤），半自动方法表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 自动分割技术（如U-Net）在腺瘤分割中表现良好，但对小结构（如正常腺体）仍需改进。未来需更大、更多样化的数据集以提升临床适用性。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度QFMs在真实量子硬件上部署的挑战，如电路噪声和硬件限制，以及变分量子算法中的计算瓶颈。

Method: 采用对比学习和分层训练机制，构建深度架构，避免变分量子参数的优化。

Result: 在噪声量子数据任务中表现优于量子卷积神经网络，且在经典图像分类任务中性能接近经典神经网络。

Conclusion: IQFMs为解决当前量子增强机器学习的限制提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实数据库应用中复杂SQL问题的调试瓶颈，并推动开源模型在数据库任务中的发展。

Method: 提出BIRD-CRITIC基准和Six-Gym训练环境，采用SQL-Rewind策略和f-Plan Boosting方法。

Result: Bird-Fixer模型在BIRD-CRITIC基准上表现优于主流专有模型，如Claude-3.7-Sonnet和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: 该研究为SQL调试能力的民主化迈出了重要一步，并提供了开源工具和基准。

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

Result: 实验表明，N3DR增强的流程显著优于传统的SfM算法，支持高精度3D映射和异常检测。

Conclusion: N3DR技术有望提升小型无人机系统的能力，尤其在受限环境中。

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

Motivation: TLG的线性特性限制了其分类能力，需要网络结构完成复杂任务，因此需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: 提出receptron模型，使用非线性输入依赖权重函数，并在3D空间中验证其选择性激活特性。

Result: receptron在立方体域内对模拟输入表现出选择性激活，并可扩展到多维空间。

Conclusion: receptron网络可能成为一类新型设备，适用于高选择性和分类需求的边缘应用，无需复杂训练。

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream

mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and

them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from

Result: TRT在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，能有效缓解过拟合并提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRT通过时间信息集中现象，指导网络在信息丰富的时间步学习鲁棒特征，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved
the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit
nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting
accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）提取可解释的概念嵌入，通过量化比较真实与生成图像中概念的普遍性，识别盲点。训练了一个包含32,000个概念的RA-SAE，用于精细分析。

Result: 在四种流行生成模型（Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, Kandinsky）中发现了特定的抑制盲点（如鸟食器、DVD光盘）和夸张盲点（如木质背景纹理）。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个理论框架，通过评估生成模型与数据生成过程的概念保真度，系统识别其概念盲点。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

TL;DR: Reptile是一个工具，结合规则和GPT-4，将正则表达式转换为DPL模式，解决了迁移到现代日志分析平台的成本高和易错问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业软件和数据中心的日志分析工具需要从正则表达式迁移到特定领域语言（如DPL），手动转换成本高且易错。

Method: Reptile结合规则转换和GPT-4优化，部分无法完全转换的情况采用尽力而为策略。

Result: 评估显示，Reptile成功转换了73.7%的正则表达式，优化后的F1分数和MCC均超过0.91。

Conclusion: Reptile为迁移到现代日志分析平台提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

Motivation: 恶意机器人账户在社交媒体上传播垃圾信息、操纵公众舆论，研究旨在探索更有效的检测方法。

Result: 在六个新发布的Twitter账户数据集上的分析表明，通用分类器和低成本特征可用于检测高级机器人。

Conclusion: 研究为检测高级机器人提供了新思路，强调了低成本特征和通用分类器的潜力。

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合强大但不可信的LLM与本地弱模型的方法，通过加密搜索保护用户隐私，性能提升7.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在使用LLM时面临隐私与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 采用Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning，生成非隐私的子查询，通过加密搜索本地数据，结合本地模型生成最终响应。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准上，混合框架性能优于单独使用GPT-4o达7.1%。

Conclusion: 展示了在保护隐私的同时，通过任务分解和混合模型提升性能的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Motivation: 随着LLM应用的普及和多样化，提示注入攻击威胁其安全性，现有防御措施不足，因此研究检测技术的性能和解决方案的有效性至关重要。

Method: 研究分析了多种提示泄漏检测技术，并对开源解决方案（LLM Guard、Vigil、Rebuff）进行了比较性能测试。

Result: 发现Vigil和Rebuff的检测技术存在不足，提出了改进建议；比较结果显示Vigil在低误报率场景最优，Rebuff适合一般需求。

Conclusion: 提示泄漏检测技术需进一步优化，Vigil和Rebuff各有适用场景，未来研究应关注技术改进和实际部署效果。

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏对合成图像生成方法的全面调查和比较，尤其是在训练分类器时，需要从生成-采样-分类的流程中评估隐私与实用性。

Method: 系统分类现有方法，使用模型无关的成员推理攻击（MIAs）作为隐私风险衡量标准，并通过基准测试比较不同生成方法。

Result: 研究提供了关于合成数据能否替代真实数据、如何平衡实用性与隐私、缓解措施是否有效以及不同生成模型表现的实证结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为合成数据生成的实用性与隐私权衡提供了可操作的见解，并指导了实际应用中的数据发布策略。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image
generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field
lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation
methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic
images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of
generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and
outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically
categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations
along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare
diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative
generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)
as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical
questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which
release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the
utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different
scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides
actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data
generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies
for real-world applications.

TL;DR: PrivacyXray是一种通过分析LLM内部状态检测隐私泄露的新框架，解决了隐私提取攻击无法验证准确性的问题，平均准确率达92.69%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在敏感领域的广泛应用引发隐私泄露担忧，现有攻击方法无法验证提取信息的准确性，缺乏公开数据集验证。

Method: PrivacyXray通过分析LLM内部状态（语义相似性和概率分布）检测隐私泄露，无需依赖外部数据。

Result: 实验显示，PrivacyXray在五种LLM上平均准确率达92.69%，比现有方法提升20.06%。

Conclusion: PrivacyXray解决了隐私检测中的关键挑战，具有稳定性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决视频与音频生成中的语义对齐和同步问题，同时扩展音频生成的多样性和质量。

Method: 采用多模态扩散变换器、视觉语义表示模块和音视频同步模块，结合通用潜在音频编解码器和立体声渲染方法。

Result: 在分布匹配、语义对齐、时间对齐和音频质量方面达到公开模型的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Kling-Foley通过模块化设计和多模态建模，显著提升了音视频生成的质量和同步性。

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统评估存在主观指标难以比较、客观指标缺乏验证的问题，尤其是面对高质量合成语音时。

Method: 提出了TTSDS2指标，并通过多语言和多领域实验验证其性能。

Result: TTSDS2在所有评估领域中与主观评分的Spearman相关性均超过0.50，优于其他16种指标。

Conclusion: TTSDS2是一种更稳健的TTS评估指标，并提供了相关资源支持未来研究。

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

Result: 在多声源场景下，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合α稳定模型和神经网络的方法在多声源定位中表现更优。

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

Motivation: 现有音频深度伪造数据集缺乏多样化的口音，尤其是南亚口音，导致模型在真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 构建了包含50名印度英语使用者的27.17小时真实和伪造音频的IFD数据集，并评估了其性能。

Conclusion: IFD填补了数据集的空白，为音频深度伪造检测提供了更全面的资源。

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.
