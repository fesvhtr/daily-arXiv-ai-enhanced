To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network\ndesigned to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.\nLeveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts\ntime-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.\nThis integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate\nmodules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)\nconversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error\npropagation.

To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor\nDefense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various\nbackdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify\ninputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with\nthese inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the\nbackdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD\nreduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean\naccuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing\ndefenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted\nto poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining\nlow ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is\ncompromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional\nefficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense\nscenarios.

However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree.

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the\nsafety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to\nuncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our\nDriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction\nperformance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy\nsoaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation\non an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a\nsignificant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to\n68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in\nreal-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faBEV\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cDriveMRP-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BEV\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6570\u636eDriveMRP-10K\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1VLM\u65e0\u5173\u7684DriveMRP-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDriveMRP-Agent\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece27.13%\u63d0\u5347\u81f388.03%\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece29.42%\u63d0\u5347\u81f368.50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper examines the integration of large language\nmodels with African natural products for depression support, combining\ntraditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create\naccessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.\n  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African\nmedicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their\npharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system\nthat leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system\nprovides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their\nclinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while\nmaintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings\ndemonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between\ntraditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally\nappropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and\ncontemporary medical understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u6d32\u4f20\u7edf\u8349\u836f\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982DeepSeek\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u6297\u6291\u90c1\u7597\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6297\u6291\u90c1\u7597\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8d77\u6548\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u62b5\u6297\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u975e\u6d32\u4f20\u7edf\u8349\u836f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u6d32\u836f\u7528\u690d\u7269\u7684\u6297\u6291\u90c1\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u836f\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8349\u836f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u533b\u7597\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5b9c\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u533b\u7597\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While remote\nsensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,\nexisting approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical\nscalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and\nheterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification\nessential for proactive decision-making.\n  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for\ntargeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,\nmulti-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our\nmethodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite\nimagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model\nsuccessfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly\n90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop\ncensus 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach\nincorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop\nsowing and harvest periods.

Despite significant\nadvancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains\n(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains\n(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain\ngeneralization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose\ndeep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection\non various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly\nfocusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial\nto achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For\nsome domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis\nrelying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in\neach modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this\nfusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of\nmisinformation.

There is an increasing effort to\nendow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand\nand manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a\nnew evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial\ndeformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial\ndeformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can\ngenerate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any\ndata leakage.

However, medical datasets often\ncontain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for\nedge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are\noften small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models\nmemorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,\ncould pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with\nmis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training\nstrategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset\nselection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,\nenabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing\ncomputational overhead.

While cross-attention models achieve\nstrong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic\ncomplexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this\nchallenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures\nthe power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent\npipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving\nmultimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion\nblock built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric\ncross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming\nmodality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit\n(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,\nenabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,\nrecurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it\nideal for high-modality environments.

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice.

Despite\nexisting studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the\nissue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These\nspurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in\nthe textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,\nand (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in\nvideo content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with\nincorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual\nreasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and\nenhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task\nfrom a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address\nunobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or\nphrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to\nestimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is\nperformed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on\nvideo features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features.

Current methodologies primarily focus on\nsynthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of\nnegative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework: \\textbf{S}elf-Aligning\n\\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \\textbf{A}nswer-O\\textbf{r}iented\nChain-of-\\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize\nAoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate\nhigh-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment\nto enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving\nproof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract\ncritical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided\nwith ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.\nConversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the\nmodel generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form\nof discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data\noutperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior\nreasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate\nhigher-quality preference data for further optimization.

However, automated data quality control faces\nunique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed\ndirectly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndata quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the\ntraining dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have\nsimilar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence\nof the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private\ndomains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative\ntraining fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data\nquality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the\nprivate data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner\nproducts as a measurement of data quality.

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on\nseveral established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,\nit demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets\nsettings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent\nembeddings for generated image detection.

Two recent\ntechnological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that\ncombines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of\nquantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log\ndata,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but\nthat can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second\nis the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern\nrecognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step\ntoward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to\ntransform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's\nlife trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%).

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency.

A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of\nartificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these\nquestions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,\nsuch as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural\nnetworks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --\nrepresent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging\nempirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior\nas models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),\nwhich have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same\ntask. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions\nabout the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to\ncomplete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere\nimplementation of the pLoT solution.

To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects.

Applying our method\nto the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in\nmapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial\nbenchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o\noutperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within\nthe prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but\nrefinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis\nrevealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in\ngranularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate.

To mitigate these\nissues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where\nLLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing\nMAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes\nLLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences\nperformance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM\nagents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called \"CortexDebate\".\nInspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically\noptimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate\nconstructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only\ndebates with the ones that are helpful to it.

In\nthis work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images\nand textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a\nbenchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression\nand description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,\nand fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction\nperformance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies\nsuch as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is\ninsufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across\nmolecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in\nconjunction with LoRA further improves the performance.

Prior studies of LLM reliability have\nprimarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while\nmathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of\nunsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in\nmathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both\nsolvable and unsolvable problems.

However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger\nsets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant\nunlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)\nor large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions\nfrom those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution\n(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can\nlead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework\nwith an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize\nunlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets\ndemonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves\nthe performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and\n(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD\nimages leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS\noutperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,\nrespectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance.

However, enhancing\ndata quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the\ntrade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While\nrule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at\nthe document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content\nwithin documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose\n$\\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of\npre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient\nand fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and\nnaturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling\nhigh-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal\nedit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used\nto train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve\nevery instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch\npre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms\nmodels trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse\ndownstream tasks.

Existing\ndeepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in\npixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the\nsource face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The\nprevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread\nfalse information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create\nnon-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the\ncreation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures\nare not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating\nwidely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake\ndetection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of\nvariations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises\nprivacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal\nfacial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is\nto identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively\nwithout accessing the real facial image.

The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval\nthat comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'\nknowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and\nEnglish; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further\nresearch and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning\nto diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based\nmulti-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained\nevaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that\n(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom\non BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs\nonly on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their\nproprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.\nAdditionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other\nin-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in\nmultidisciplinary reasoning.

The\ninterpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but\ntypically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in\norder to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are\nalready installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they\ndirectly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate\ninstantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point\nclouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance\nscene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify\nmoving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform\nsingle-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The\nkey to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity\ninformation throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise\nsegmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a\ntransformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively\ncombining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse\npoint clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation\nbenchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,\na design that can accommodate communication between modules to further\naccelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm.

Recent advancements\nhave demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which\nprovide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.\nHowever, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods\nfail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time\nseries, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared\nfeatures. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled\nMulti-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea\nof DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time\nseries, thereby improving prediction performance.

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple\nscore-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model\nimproved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused\nwith BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B\ndataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset.

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

However, these\nrationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to\nwasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for\nstreamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or\ncost-sensitive settings.

Our approach addresses\ntwo key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to\nadjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the\nsteering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'\nrepresentation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation\nediting-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based\nscaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty\nestimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these\ntechniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast\nprocessing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any\ntraining or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%\naccuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning\nbenchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are\nexpected to support broader applications and inspire future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u601d\u8003\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f\u6162\u901f\u3001\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684System 2\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u76f4\u89c9\u7684System 1\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u96be\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u601d\u8003\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53471.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c118.6%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4e3aLRMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u542f\u53d1\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that\ntokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater\nimportance.

This paper extends Pearl's approach to\ncausality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic\nprograms. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal\ninterpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by\nBochman and Eelink et al.

However, existing models typically produce\nonly short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and\nreal-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details.

However, the slow inference speed and high\ncomputational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for\npractical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as\nlip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start\nand end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of\nlarge video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important\nquestion: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in\ngeneralization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,\nwe dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the\ndetails: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for\nhuman animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local\nreconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the\ninterplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and\naudio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse\nmulti-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward\nalternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters\nto achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters\ncount. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,\nhigh-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both\nperformance and practicality challenges in the field.

Current scene flow\nestimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point\nclouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart\nvehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture\nthe 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene\nflow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates\nthe scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we\npropose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic\nmodel-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong\nsupervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene\nflow of static points.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often\nstruggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to\nconsider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art\nmethods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative\nsolutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color\ndistortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework\n(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting\nconditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an\nilluminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a\nspecialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition\nfield establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light\nconditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of\nillumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more\neffective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.\nTo implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a\nlow-rank denoising module.

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,\napplies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local\ndependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model\nlong-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention.

We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the\nEST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By\nmaintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST\nachieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively\nbreaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on\nthe STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,\ndemonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of\nthese tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an\neffective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard\nTransformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data\nscenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEcho State Transformers (EST)\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u4e14\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "EST\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u50a8\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728STREAM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u768412\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEST\u57288\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eGRUs\u3001LSTMs\u548c\u6807\u51c6Transformers\u3002", "conclusion": "EST\u662fGRUs\u548cLSTMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,\nit is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.\nIn contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and\ncompositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,\nfine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying\nstate-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat\nimagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad\nhabitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and\nsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification\nmetrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene\nunderstanding tailored to ground-level images.

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement.

Traditional\nmethods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired\nimage-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual\nattributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these\nlimitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The\nfirst stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large\nVision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align\nhierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal\nsemantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The\nsecond stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this\nacquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where\nthe LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image\ngeneration process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for\nprecise output alignment.

Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need\nto be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn\nsuch consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions\nare bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To\naddress this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic\nscene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D\noutpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D\npixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input\nwith the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the\nray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to\na dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the\npartial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the\npoint cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video\nto update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future\nnovel views.

In this work,\nwe investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such\nmemorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning\ncapabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy\nlabels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we\ndiscover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:\nmodels continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving\nmemorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects\nmemorization.

Our method is\ncompatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we\nintroduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,\nsemantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent\ntext, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with\ntrainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to\n\"representational interference\" in conventional models, where the embedding\nlayer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our\nresults indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings\nbut are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture\nand data scale.

This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing.

Existing\nSDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle\nto effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To\naddress this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided\noptimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE\nmeasurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model\ntraining near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances\nstability and adaptability.

Our motivation stems from the\nobservation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability\nto simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining\ncomplete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models\n(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range\nmodeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial\nsince our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity\nmethods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade\nperformance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information\nduring multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To\nresolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise\nheight information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby\nenhancing camera-LiDAR alignment.

However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:\nsignificant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and\nlimited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing\nmethods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer\narchitectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,\nCNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,\nand Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their\napplication to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes\nRegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models\n(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of\nCRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional\ncross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear\ncomplexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under\ntexture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)\nstrategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through\nmultiple feature experts.

Leveraging the POLAR\npre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from\n1.8B to 7B.

However, existing methods are limited to\nchallenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information\nand lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,\nspatial and semantic information.

Specifically,\nDreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,\nintegrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet\ncomprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how\nhumans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning\nchains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features.

However, optimizing\ncompound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures\nand diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,\nhyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains.

Existing models typically specialize either in\ndescriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in\nisolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,\nboth lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,\nlimiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,\nour work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture\ngeneration, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially\ngrounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing\ntwo-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized\nmotion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.\nOur framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic\ndata generation and situated evaluation.

Impressive developments from\ncompanies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about\ncatastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time\nfocussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved\ninto a \"pro-innovation\" strategy, in which the government directed existing\nregulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but\navoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived\nin late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The\nUK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and\nhosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -\nrefrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new\ngovernment was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the\ntime of writing is yet to do so.\n  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:\nharnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating\nrisk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based\nregulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures\nagainst risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more\ntechnical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated\nmisinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,\ndiscrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but\nimportant role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.\n  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic\nsocieties can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u82f1\u56fd\u5728AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0a\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u4ecb\u4e8e\u6b27\u76df\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403AI\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3002\u4ece2012\u5e74\u5173\u6ce8\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u52302022\u5e74\u7684\u201c\u652f\u6301\u521b\u65b0\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u518d\u52302023\u5e74\u6210\u7acbAI\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u5e76\u4e3e\u529e\u56fd\u9645\u5cf0\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7ba1\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u30022024\u5e74\u65b0\u653f\u5e9c\u627f\u8bfa\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5efa\u7acb\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u82f1\u56fd\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u7ba1\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c55\u793a\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528AI\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u56fdAI\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u53ca\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u7acb\u539f\u5219\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u56fd\u5728AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u586b\u8865\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82f1\u56fd\u82e5\u80fd\u5b8c\u5584AI\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\u5728\u5229\u7528AI\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ba1\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u793a\u8303\u3002"}}

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment.

The study also discusses the potential\nenhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the\nAI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include\ncommunication between living researchers and their electronic copies,\ncollaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and\ninterconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information\naccess and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership\nand security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for\nresponsible implementation.

In 3D VQA, the\nfree-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can\nconfuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text\ngeneration tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,\nthe scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading\nannotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances\nfor training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the\noracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a\nmulti-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data\nbased on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more\neffectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve\npotentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a\nvariance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into\nconsideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of\nprevious assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model\nperformance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of\ntraining costs for achieving relatively high accuracy.

However, enabling\nsuch collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact\nwith host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,\nfine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure\ninteractions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for\nnon-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically\nconfigure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.\nAdditionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.\n  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and\nseamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs\na Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level\nintents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless\ndevice collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for\nauthorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing\nhardware-independent abstractions.\n  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto\nconfiguration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in\nlarge-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation\npipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%\naccuracy.

Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification\nperformance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,\nsuch as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is\nparticularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame\nloss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above\nchallenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model\nfor multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise\ninterference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both\nlocal and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their\ndependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph\nrepresentation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local\ncues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the\nexpressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated\nembeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an\nuncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples\nto experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses\nnoise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design\nan uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,\nimproving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five\nrepresentative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral\nmodalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves\nexcellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current\nmethods in terms of noise immunity.

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In\nfact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1\nopen-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\\% of intermittent job\nfailures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using\nfew-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model\nusing a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich\nembeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based\napproach achieves 70-88\\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,\noutperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\\% F1-score) in 4\nprojects.

We\nshow that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced\nchoice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence\nin their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind.

Our analysis\nreveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical\nrisks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated\ndevelopment, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,\nstudies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team\ncollaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of\nstudies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two\nSPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer\nproductivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial\nroom for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency\nare the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and\nActivity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and\nmethodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.\nThis review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future\nresearch and practice.

Though progress continues to be made, general\npurpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative\nanswers, often called \"hallucinations\", which have slowed their application in\nthe medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that\nthe design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a\nmore rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In\nthis work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task\nof predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps\nin our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt\nto correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually\ncurated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative\nexamples as part of an active learning scheme.

Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to\ncreation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or\nfine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,\neach job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in\nexcessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular\ninference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow\nindependent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They\ncannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and\nfine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to\nexpose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we\naddress the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.\nThe base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning\nprocesses.

In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts.

Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically\nbrief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural\nlanguage are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the\nexpensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task\nof explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the\nunderlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and\ntime. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast\nto conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a\ndistribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty.

Accordingly,\nautonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their\nenvironment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.\nHowever, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase\nvehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE\nlevels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,\ncontextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly\nwith the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.\nThese developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the\nbroader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered\nmobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles\n(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and\ninteract within complex environments.

The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to\nadditive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple\ncounting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable.

An accurate and robust\nevaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.\nOrdinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories\nto achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification.

Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and\nvideo-based) in this task and achieve strong performance.

Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus\non constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of\nhuman-labelled data.

We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing\nvision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of\ntest data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on\nseven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,\nrelying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just\n1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.\nFurther, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in\nlabelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all\nmethods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated\ntest-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while\nachieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines.

However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare\nresources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering\nincomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic\naccuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and\ndistillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle\nwith accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are\nlocalized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely\nheavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of\nrobustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By\nconsidering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,\nwe emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and\nexplicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing\nmodality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal\nfeature alignment under the missing modality.

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific\ninference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment.

To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain.

Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set.

Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has\ninvestigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels\nconsider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations.

Recently,\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire\nreasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without\nrequiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement\nlearning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the\nSpatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model\nwithout CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic\nRewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward\nto provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative\ncompletions.

A\ncommon and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to\nenhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these\ncombinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful\nfeature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While\nfeature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically\nlimited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for\nhigh-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due\nto the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature\ncombinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{TayFCS}$, a\nlightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves\nmodel performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer\n(TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead\nof evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly\nrunning experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to\napproximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can\nbe simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation\nmodel.

The experimental results on several PolSAR\ndatasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of\nachieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the\nanalytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can\nbe obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the\ninterpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PolSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6781\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\uff08PTD\uff09\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PaCBM\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728PolSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u9ed1\u76d2\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408PTD\u548cPaCBM\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6781\u5316\u6563\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528KAN\u66ff\u4ee3MLP\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPolSAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728PolSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However,\n  the intricate tree-like tubular structure of blood vessels poses significant\nchallenges for existing\n  segmentation algorithms. Small vascular branches are often overlooked due to\ntheir low contrast\n  compared to surrounding tissues, leading to incomplete vessel segmentation.\nFurthermore, the\n  complex vascular topology prevents the model from accurately capturing and\nreconstructing vascular\n  structure, resulting in incorrect topology, such as breakpoints at the\nbifurcation of the vascular tree.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vessel segmentation\nframework called PASC Net.

Furthermore, to better preserve the coherence and integrity of\nvascular topology, the HTC\n  module incorporates hierarchical topological constraints-spanning linear,\nplanar, and volumetric\n  levels-which serve to regularize the network's representation of vascular\ncontinuity and structural\n  consistency.

In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge.

Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.\nNevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high\ncomputational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior\nvisual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image\nrendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices\nsuch as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual\nbehavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user\nexperience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,\na technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's\ngaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated\nrendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering\nprocess.\n  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the\ncomputational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes\noutweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency.

It is challenging for this\ncross-platform heterogeneous image registration due to significant geometric\nand radiation differences, which current methods fail to handle.

Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are\nvulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work,\nwe present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of\nmobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework\nAgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen\ncontent within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a\ncomprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution\nenvironment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling\nover 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58\nreproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content,\nwhile the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14\npopular commercial apps.

This study investigates\ndrivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how\nstreet characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that\nthe mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving\nspeeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can\nimprove speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply\ncomputer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View\nimages. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built\nenvironments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater\nvisibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the\ninfluence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed\nmethodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to\nMilan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and\nDubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric\ndesign. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in\nMilan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines\nfor driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a\nmachine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street\ncharacteristics.

For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire\narrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and\ndiscuss the obtained design solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4e0d\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5173\u8282\u626d\u77e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5236\u4e3a2D\u5e73\u9762\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4ea4\u53c9\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u7ef4\u8fde\u6746\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4e0d\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5173\u8282\u626d\u77e9\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, 3D\nvolume reconstruction from only two orthogonal projections represents a\nprofoundly ill-posed inverse problem, owing to the intrinsic lack of depth\ninformation and irreducible ambiguities in soft-tissue visualization. Some\nexisting methods can reconstruct skeletal structures and Computed Tomography\n(CT) volumes, they often yield incomplete bone geometry, imprecise tissue\nboundaries, and a lack of anatomical realism, thereby limiting their clinical\nutility in scenarios such as surgical planning and postoperative assessment. In\nthis study, we introduce SPIDER, a novel supervised framework designed to\nreconstruct CT volumes from biplanar X-ray images. SPIDER incorporates tissue\nstructure as prior (e.g., anatomical segmentation) into an implicit neural\nrepresentation decoder in the form of joint supervision through a unified\nencoder-decoder architecture.

Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the\napproach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2\nframes (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised\nmethods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust\nperformance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for\nES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized\nheart views due to fetal heart positioning variability.

Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting\nLLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven\nNIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is\nproposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection\nworkflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this\npaper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster\ninnovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By\npresenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire\nadvancement in next-generation network security systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NIDS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6311\u6218\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fdNIDS\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8ba4\u77e5NIDS\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728NIDS\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684NIDS\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The second two theories (affect control theory,\nfundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of\nchatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by\nleveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to\ncultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance\ncommunities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation).

However, existing benchmarks\npredominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's\ncapability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is\ncrucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,\nmulti-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818\ninteractions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and\nleakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications.

During the response phase of disasters, airports are important\nhubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the\nairport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden\nneed for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational\nside of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,\nfirst, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,\nand second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand\nthe effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource\nallocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an\nairport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing\nrealistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information\nuncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in\nthe field.

However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to\nsupport fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase\nexploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel\nstructured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:\ndynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are\nsystematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space\nbaselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in\nparticular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control\nprecision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of\ncontext-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous\ndriving tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fee\u6539\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u63a2\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001PPO\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5c4f\u853d\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}
