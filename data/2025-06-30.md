TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1模型通过M3CTS生成高质量空间推理监督，结合fDPO优化细粒度空间推理，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不足。

Method: 采用M3CTS生成多样化逻辑一致的LongCoT轨迹，提出fDPO优化细粒度偏好，结合空间奖励机制。

Result: fDPO在空间质量和数量任务中分别提升4.1%和9.0%，SpatialReasoner-R1在SPATIALRGPT-Bench上刷新SoTA。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1通过创新方法显著提升空间推理能力，同时保持通用任务竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

### [2] [TanDiT: Tangent-Plane Diffusion Transformer for High-Quality 360° Panorama Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21681)
*Hakan Çapuk,Andrew Bond,Muhammed Burak Kızıl,Emir Göçen,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TanDiT是一种新方法，通过生成覆盖360度视图的切平面图像网格来合成全景场景，解决了现有模型在全景图像生成中的几何失真和一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中面临几何失真和一致性挑战，需要一种新方法来克服这些问题。

Method: TanDiT使用统一的扩散模型在单次去噪迭代中生成切平面图像，并提出模型无关的后处理步骤以增强全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TanDiT能有效泛化训练数据之外的内容，处理复杂文本提示，并与其他生成模型无缝集成，生成高质量全景图像。

Conclusion: TanDiT为全景图像生成提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，并通过新指标和基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

### [3] [FOCUS: Internal MLLM Representations for Efficient Fine-Grained Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21710)
*Liangyu Zhong,Fabio Rosenthal,Joachim Sicking,Fabian Hüger,Thorsten Bagdonat,Hanno Gottschalk,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，利用MLLM内部表示指导搜索最相关图像区域，显著提升细粒度VQA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉裁剪方法需要任务特定微调、效率低或与高效注意力实现不兼容的问题。

Method: 通过四步实现：识别目标对象、计算对象相关性图、提出并排序相关图像区域、使用排名最高区域执行VQA任务。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行视觉裁剪方法，计算效率提升3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS是一种高效且无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，显著提升细粒度VQA任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

### [4] [CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711)
*Aryan Thakre,Omkar Nagwekar,Vedang Talekar,Aparna Santra Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAST的统一模型，通过交叉注意力机制融合时空特征，显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型在时空特征融合上存在局限，需要更高效的检测方法。

Method: 提出CAST模型，利用交叉注意力动态融合时空特征，增强对时间演化伪造痕迹（如闪烁眼睛或扭曲嘴唇）的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上表现优异，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%。跨数据集测试中AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力机制显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

### [5] [Elucidating and Endowing the Diffusion Training Paradigm for General Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21722)
*Xin Lu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Xiao,Zihao Fan,Yurui Zhu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将扩散训练范式融入通用图像修复（IR）框架的方法，通过系统分析时间步依赖、网络层次、噪声级别关系和多任务相关性，提升了单任务和多任务IR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像修复任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但其复杂架构和迭代过程限制了实际应用。现有方法忽视了将扩散训练范式融入通用IR框架的可能性。

Method: 提出了一种新的IR框架，通过时间步依赖、网络层次等分析，引入正则化策略和增量训练范式，结合任务特定适配器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了单任务IR的泛化能力，并在多任务统一IR中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架可无缝集成到现有通用IR架构中，为扩散训练范式在IR中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

### [6] [End-to-End RGB-IR Joint Image Compression With Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21851)
*Haofeng Wang,Fangtao Zhou,Qi Zhang,Zeyuan Chen,Enci Zhang,Zhao Wang,Xiaofeng Huang,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种RGB-IR图像对的联合压缩框架，通过跨模态熵模型（CCEM）提升压缩效率，实验证明优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RGB-IR图像对在多模态应用中的使用增加，存储和传输成本成倍增长，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了CCEM模型，包含LCEB和LCFB模块，用于提取和融合跨模态的低频信息，以更准确地预测熵参数。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上表现优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP数据集上节省了23.1%的比特率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

### [7] [Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation for 3D Self-Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21724)
*Remco F. Leijenaar,Hamidreza Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsymDSD是一种自监督学习框架，通过潜在空间预测结合掩码建模和不变性学习，显著提升了3D点云的语义表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无标签大规模3D点云数据中语义表示学习的挑战，克服传统掩码点建模（MPM）在高层次语义捕捉上的局限性。

Method: 提出Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation（AsymDSD）框架，结合掩码建模和不变性学习，采用潜在空间预测、非对称设置、多掩码采样和多裁剪等技术。

Result: 在ScanObjectNN上达到90.53%的准确率，预训练后提升至93.72%，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过创新设计显著提升了3D点云的语义表示能力，为自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

### [8] [LLaVA-Scissor: Token Compression with Semantic Connected Components for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21862)
*Boyuan Sun,Jiaxing Zhao,Xihan Wei,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的令牌压缩策略，用于视频多模态大语言模型，通过语义连通组件（SCC）实现全面的语义覆盖，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力分数的令牌压缩方法无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且存在冗余，需要更高效的压缩策略。

Method: 采用语义连通组件（SCC）方法，将令牌分配到不同的语义区域，实现两步时空令牌压缩。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor提供了一种高效的令牌压缩方案，显著提升了视频多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

### [9] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MESP和LCH两个理论框架，探讨概率生成模型的局限性，即全局分布学习导致记忆而非生成行为。MESP源自对VAE的重新思考，提出基于重叠系数的下界，并设计了BL-AE和ARVM模型。LCH假设生成能力源于局部相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索概率生成模型在全局分布学习中的局限性，即模型倾向于记忆而非生成数据。

Method: 提出MESP框架，设计BL-AE编码二进制潜在表示，结合ARVM模型输出直方图。LCH假设局部相关性驱动生成能力。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但发现分数反映记忆行为。LCH验证了局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，并提出局部相关性是生成能力的关键因素。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and
the role of sensor fusion in end-to-end autonomous driving, highlighting its
potential to enhance system adaptability and robustness. Our work offers
valuable insights into current methods and future directions for multi-sensor
fusion in autonomous driving.

Method: 提出FedNCA系统，基于轻量级Med-NCA架构，支持低成本边缘设备（如智能手机）训练，并减少通信开销。

Result: FedNCA在资源受限环境中高效运行，支持加密通信，适合医疗图像分割任务。

Conclusion: FedNCA为资源受限地区提供了高效、轻量级且安全的医疗影像解决方案，推动医疗公平。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

*Xinghan Wang,Kun Xu,Fei Li,Cao Sheng,Jiazhong Yu,Yadong Mu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，用于生成基于文本描述和人类属性的运动，填补了现有方法忽略人类属性影响的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本驱动的人类运动生成方法忽视了人类属性（如年龄、性别、体重和身高）对运动模式的影响，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种受结构因果模型启发的新框架，将动作语义与人类属性解耦，实现文本到语义的预测和属性控制的生成。

Result: 模型能够生成与用户文本和属性输入一致的、真实且属性感知的运动。

Conclusion: 通过引入HumanAttr数据集和广泛实验，验证了模型的有效性，为属性感知的文本到运动生成设定了首个基准。

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ImplicitQA基准，测试视频问答模型在隐含推理上的能力，填补现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准多关注显性视觉内容，忽略隐含推理（如动机、因果关系等），而人类擅长此类推理。

Method: 构建ImplicitQA基准，包含1K QA对，覆盖8类隐含推理维度，基于高质量创意视频。

Result: 主流模型在ImplicitQA上表现下降，显示其对表面视觉线索的依赖和隐含推理的难度。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA为视频问答研究提供新方向，推动模型向人类式理解发展。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,

minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on

Motivation: 探索计算机视觉技术在自我中心视频中的应用，评估现有方法的表现，推动该领域的发展。

Method: 评估了三种方法：监督学习（Shotluck Holmes）、无监督学习（TAC-SUM）和提示微调（GPT-4o），在Ego-Exo4D数据集的小子集上进行实验。

Result: 当前最先进模型在第一人称视频中表现较差，而通用模型GPT-4o表现更优，表明现有方法在适应第一人称视角上存在不足。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以改进自我中心视频的处理技术，提示微调方法显示出潜力，但仍需更多探索。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注手术分析的孤立方面（如工具检测或阶段分割），缺乏对实体间语义关系的全面表示。

Method: 提出CAT-SG数据集，包含工具-组织交互、手术变体和时序依赖的结构化标注；并开发场景图生成模型CatSGG。

Result: CAT-SG提供了手术工作流的整体视图，CatSGG模型在生成结构化手术表示方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为AI驱动的手术培训、实时决策支持和流程分析提供了更智能、上下文感知的系统基础。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉基础模型和高效微调的历史地图少样本分割方法，性能显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图的多样性和标注数据稀缺性对自动化处理提出了挑战，需要一种高效的分割方法。

Method: 结合大型视觉基础模型的语义嵌入和参数高效微调，实现少样本分割。

Result: 在Siegfried和ICDAR 2021数据集上表现优异，mIoU和PQ显著提升，且参数效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了对人工标注的依赖，推动了历史地图自动化处理的发展。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

TL;DR: PrefPaint通过结合人类反馈改进Stable Diffusion Inpainting，提升医学图像修复的准确性，尤其在息肉图像生成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像修复（如息肉图像）的准确性对诊断至关重要，现有模型可能生成不准确结果，需专家标注以确保可靠性。

Method: 提出PrefPaint，将人类反馈直接融入训练过程，避免昂贵奖励模型；开发基于Web的交互界面简化训练与推理。

Result: PrefPaint在多个领域优于现有方法，减少视觉不一致性，尤其在医学图像中生成更真实的息肉图像。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过人类反馈和交互界面显著提升医学图像修复的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

TL;DR: ProSAM提出了一种改进的视觉参考分割方法，通过变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，解决了现有SAM方法在边界生成提示的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SAM的视觉参考分割方法由于提示编码器的不足，常在对象边界生成不稳定提示，导致分割结果不稳定。

Method: ProSAM引入变分提示编码器，预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，ProSAM优于现有方法，提供了更稳健的分割解决方案。

Conclusion: ProSAM通过改进提示生成机制，显著提升了视觉参考分割的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的EEG编码器架构，结合双重自注意力机制，成功从EEG数据中重建3D物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将EEG数据转换为2D图像，忽略了3D空间信息的重建，限制了BCI的实际应用。

Method: 采用双重自注意力机制的EEG编码器架构，结合交叉注意力、对比学习和自监督学习的混合训练策略，并使用稳定扩散和变分分数蒸馏训练神经辐射场。

Result: 成功从EEG数据中生成了内容和结构相似的3D物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为从EEG数据重建3D视觉刺激提供了新思路，拓展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从面部视频中捕捉细微的肤色变化以估计生理信号（如心率）是rPPG的关键，但现有方法在跨数据集评估中表现不佳。

Method: 使用视频掩码自编码器（MAE）学习高维时空表示，结合帧掩码和生理带宽约束来捕捉周期性信号。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG、MMPD和V4V数据集上的实验表明，该方法在跨数据集评估中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过自监督学习和生理约束，有效提升了rPPG任务的性能，尤其在跨数据集场景下表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字病理学和自监督深度学习的快速发展为多任务基础模型提供了可能，但WSI与ST数据的全面整合仍存在空白。

Result: 在14个下游任务中，SPADE表现出显著优于基线模型的少样本性能。

Conclusion: 整合形态学和分子信息到一个潜在空间具有显著优势。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

TL;DR: 论文提出ADL和AAM方法解决人脸对齐中的误差偏置问题，结合为ADNet，在多个数据集上取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸对齐中误差分布存在偏置（沿切线方向），但现有研究未充分关注。误差偏置与模糊标注任务相关，需利用其特性提升CNN模型收敛性。

Method: 提出各向异性方向损失（ADL）和各向异性注意力模块（AAM），分别用于坐标和热图回归。ADL在法线方向施加强约束，AAM在切线方向放松约束。

Result: ADNet在300W、WFLW和COFW数据集上达到最优性能，验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过ADL和AAM的互补作用，ADNet能同时学习人脸结构和纹理细节，显著提升人脸对齐性能。

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Result: 在新构建的密集300W测试集及原始稀疏300W和WFLW测试集上均达到最先进精度。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为一种即插即用模块，显著提升面部对齐任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对遥感（RS）图像理解的新型大型视觉与语言模型（LVLM）框架，通过语义增强的多级对齐和语义感知专家建模，解决了通用LVLM在RS领域适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感图像与自然图像在视觉外观、对象尺度和语义上存在显著差异，通用LVLM难以有效理解RS场景的多层次语义信息。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1）基于检索的语义增强模块，用于跨多层次（从细到粗）对齐视觉特征；2）语义感知专家建模，通过不同专家分别处理不同层次的语义表示。

Result: 在多个RS任务（如场景分类和视觉问答）上的评估表明，该框架在多层次语义理解上均取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究成功填补了通用LVLM与RS特定需求之间的鸿沟，展示了其在RS视觉语言理解中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Motivation: 现有ORSIs分割方法通常仅基于卷积或Transformer特征，忽略了二者的结合及其带来的挑战，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 设计了全局-局部混合注意力机制和傅里叶空间合并策略，并引入门控线性前馈网络增强表达能力，构建了DPU-Former解码器以聚合和强化不同层次的特征。

Result: DPU-Former在多个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过结合卷积和Transformer的优势，显著提升了ORSIs的分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GeoMap-Agent通过多模块协作显著提升了地质图理解能力，为地质学中的AI应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze
questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall
score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉定位中表现优异，但令牌修剪会显著降低其性能。研究发现位置ID对齐问题是主要原因，并提出了一种无需额外资源的解决方案GAP，恢复了90%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决令牌修剪导致的多模态大语言模型在视觉定位任务中性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过调整位置ID来恢复修剪后的模型性能。

Result: GAP将LLaVA在RefCOCO验证集上的准确率从修剪后的15.34%恢复到51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP是一种简单有效的解决方案，适用于多种模型和修剪策略，无需额外资源即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度解释性的框架，用于自动标记训练图像中的问题样本，以提高银屑病严重程度评分的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银屑病严重程度评分的临床评估存在评分者间差异和负担，远程成像虽具扩展性但引入非临床因素影响模型可靠性。

Method: 使用梯度解释性方法追踪误分类验证图像的梯度，检测训练样本中的不一致评分或非临床伪影。

Result: 移除8.2%的问题图像后，模型AUC-ROC提升5%（85%至90%），并成功识别90%以上评分不一致的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了远程评估的自动化评分的鲁棒性，减少了对人工审核的需求。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SODA的新方法，通过邻域评分传播方案改进点云数据的OOD检测，无需额外训练，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着点云数据的广泛应用，检测OOD点云对象对模型安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究对此问题探索不足。

Method: 利用3D视觉语言模型（3D VLMs）进行OOD检测，提出SODA方法，通过邻域评分传播解决合成到真实域偏移问题。

Result: SODA在无需额外训练的情况下，在多个数据集和问题设置中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SODA有效解决了合成到真实域偏移问题，显著提升了OOD点云检测的性能。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Conclusion: 该方法通过强化学习提炼出高度泛化的决策规则，解决了跨域人脸反欺骗任务。

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: SepFormer通过创新的单步分割与合并范式，显著提升了表格结构识别的效率和性能。

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Conclusion: SPAZER无需3D标注数据即可实现鲁棒的零样本定位，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

*Biao Wang,Wenwen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉单目标跟踪方法R1-Track，通过GRPO强化学习方法微调Qwen2.5-VL，在GOT-10k基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成模型R1-Track。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准上表现突出，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪中的潜力，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长时程视频生成的误差累积问题，显著提升了视频质量和任务执行的一致性。

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的模型压缩方法ETP，通过指数力应用方案改进现有方法的不足，实现了更高的压缩率和更低的精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的复杂性和规模快速增长，导致计算成本和内存使用问题，需要高效的模型压缩技术。现有方法（Torque-inspired regularization）的剪枝效果不理想，网络仍密集且精度下降明显。

Method: 提出指数扭矩剪枝（ETP），采用指数力应用方案进行正则化，有效剪枝冗余模块并保留必要模块。

Result: 实验表明，ETP在多个领域实现了比现有方法更高的压缩率，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单高效的模型压缩方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Motivation: 现有基于StyleGAN的面部风格化方法存在伪影或源图像保真度不足的问题，主要原因是忽略了生成器在风格化过程中的语义偏移。

Method: 提出了一种结合语义保留约束和伪配对监督的方法，并开发了多级伪配对数据集以实施监督约束。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够生成高保真、美观的面部风格化效果，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了风格化效果，还实现了更灵活的多模态和参考引导风格化，无需复杂网络设计或额外训练。

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Conclusion: HOSS ReID和TransOSS为全天候船舶跟踪提供了有效解决方案，数据集和方法已开源。

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

TL;DR: Chimera-Seg和SGD方法解决了零样本语义分割中视觉-语言对齐和局部特征与全局表示的语义鸿沟问题，实验显示性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本语义分割（ZSS）需要从已见类扩展到未见类，但现有方法在视觉-语言对齐和特征粒度匹配上存在挑战。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg模型，结合分割主干和CLIP语义头；引入SGD选择性全局蒸馏和SAM语义对齐模块。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，hIoU分别提升了0.9%和1.2%。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了ZSS中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Motivation: 现有基于重建和渲染的说话头合成方法依赖身份特定模型，计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 提出FIAG框架，结合全局高斯场（支持多身份共享表示）和通用运动场（捕捉跨身份运动动态）。

Result: 实验表明FIAG优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: FIAG为高效、可扩展的说话头合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Conclusion: 该框架简化了用户交互，提高了测量精度，同时保持了临床相关性。

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Result: 在EMTD Benchmark上，MirrorMe在保真度、唇同步准确性和时间稳定性方面表现最优。

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新设计解决了音频驱动动画的实时性和一致性问题，实现了高质量的生成效果。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Result: 在Fastec数据集上的实验验证了该方法在卷帘快门SfM初始化中的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为卷帘快门SfM提供了基础模块，具有进一步开发的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该范式为非语言机器推理提供了突破性潜力，尤其在数据稀缺场景下。

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在Waymo和nuPlan数据集上，BézierGS在动态和静态场景重建及新视角合成中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BézierGS通过曲线建模和额外监督，实现了更准确和合理的场景重建。

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新视角，代码已开源。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CP分解的低秩张量函数（CP-INR），用于连续数据表示，结合稀疏性和平滑性正则化，在多维数据恢复任务中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量分解方法（如Tucker和CP）在灵活性和可解释性之间存在权衡，且稀疏解难以获取。CP-INR旨在解决这些问题，同时利用神经网络的非线性能力。

Method: 通过神经网络参数化CP分解，引入Schatten-p拟范数实现稀疏性，并提出基于谱范数的平滑性正则化，避免显式链式求导。

Result: 在图像修复、去噪和点云上采样等任务中，CP-INR优于现有方法，展示了其优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: CP-INR为多维数据恢复提供了一种高效且可解释的方法，结合了稀疏性和平滑性，具有理论和实验优势。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频-LLMs在均匀帧采样下难以有效捕捉查询相关的关键时空线索，Q-Frame旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Q-Frame采用无训练、即插即用策略，通过文本-图像匹配网络（如CLIP）生成帧选择，并利用Gumbel-Max技巧实现高效选择。

Result: 在MLVU、LongVideoBench和Video-MME等基准数据集上，Q-Frame表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Q-Frame能够在不超出计算限制的情况下处理更多帧，保留关键的时空信息，适用于多种视频理解任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 通过增强视觉输入的低级空间结构（如水平线）并结合文本提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理中存在绑定问题，难以可靠地将感知特征与视觉对象关联，导致在计数、视觉搜索等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 在视觉输入中引入低级空间结构，并配合鼓励顺序、空间感知解析的文本提示。

Result: 在多个视觉推理任务中表现显著提升：视觉搜索准确率提高25.00%，计数准确率提高26.83%，场景描述编辑距离误差减少0.32，空间关系任务性能提升9.50%。

Conclusion: 低级视觉结构化是提升视觉语言模型在空间任务中性能的有效且未被充分探索的方向，优于纯语言方法。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetFiner是一种自监督视觉语言优化方案，通过利用文本数据的丰富监督信号，提升现有基础模型（FMs）的表征能力，从而在多样化的OCT分类任务中显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于OCT图像的自监督学习基础模型缺乏对图像的全面语义理解，导致下游任务性能不足，且需要监督微调。RetFiner旨在通过视觉语言优化解决这一问题。

Method: RetFiner采用多样化的训练目标，利用文本数据的监督信号优化现有FMs的表征能力，无需监督微调即可直接适应特定任务和人群。

Result: 在RETFound、UrFound和VisionFM三种FMs上测试，RetFiner在七种OCT分类任务中的线性探测性能平均分别提高了5.8、3.9和2.1个百分点。

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言优化显著提升了现有FMs的性能，为OCT图像分析提供了一种高效且无需监督微调的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一正交特征空间（UOFS）优化框架，用于解决少样本目标检测（FSOD）中特征空间纠缠的问题，通过解耦特征空间和混合背景优化策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSOD方法在共享特征空间中纠缠目标识别和前景分类，导致类特定目标性标准和样本不具代表性的问题。

Method: 提出UOFS框架，解耦特征空间为幅度（目标性）和角度（分类），并采用混合背景优化（HBO）策略解决未标记实例的干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于纠缠特征空间的现有方法。

Conclusion: UOFS和HBO策略有效解决了FSOD中的特征空间纠缠问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉与语义表示对齐时忽略了细粒度动作模式的重要性，导致零样本动作识别效果受限。

Method: FS-VAE包含三个关键模块：频率增强模块、多级语义对齐模块和校准交叉对齐损失函数。

Result: 实验验证了频率增强语义特征能有效区分视觉和语义相似的动作簇，提升零样本识别性能。

Conclusion: FS-VAE通过频率分解和语义对齐，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角约束显著提升了配准性能，适用于临床导航应用。

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有更高的感知质量和个性化适应性。

Conclusion: ReF-LLE为低光图像增强提供了一种高效且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过整合4D信息和优化采样策略，有效解决了预训练中的混乱问题，提升了模型的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Result: 实验表明，EAMamba在多项修复任务中显著降低FLOPs（31-89%），同时保持良好性能。

Conclusion: EAMamba为低层次视觉任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Result: 模型能自适应利用场景上下文，尤其在目标-场景高一致性或对象退化时更依赖上下文；注意力分析显示中层对目标的关注增加。

Conclusion: VLMs动态平衡局部和上下文信息进行引用生成，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Conclusion: VisionDrop通过视觉内注意力剪枝和渐进式处理，有效解决了跨模态不对齐问题，提升了LVLMs的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

TL;DR: RoomCraft是一个多阶段管道，将真实图像、草图或文本描述转换为连贯的3D室内场景，通过约束驱动优化框架解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D室内场景时面临几何一致性、空间关系和视觉真实性的平衡问题，且难以处理多约束场景。

Method: 结合场景生成管道与约束驱动优化框架，使用HDFS算法生成优化放置序列，并提出CAPS策略动态调整权重以减少碰撞。

Result: RoomCraft在生成真实、语义连贯且视觉吸引的室内布局方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段优化和冲突感知策略，有效解决了多约束场景下的3D室内场景生成问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Motivation: 解决现有潜在扩散模型在视频外绘任务中质量和适应性不足的问题，利用DiT的优越性能提升生成内容的一致性。

Method: 提出OutDreamer框架，包含高效视频控制分支和条件外绘分支，引入掩码驱动自注意力层和潜在对齐损失，并采用跨视频片段细化器确保长视频一致性。

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，OutDreamer在零样本任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新的DiT框架和优化技术，显著提升了视频外绘的质量和适应性。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨设备、跨特征检测器场景下表现不佳，因假设使用相同检测器且关键点重复性低，导致匹配困难。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了图像匹配和视觉定位的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次解决了跨检测器特征匹配问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后快速识别建筑物损坏对应急响应至关重要，但传统光学卫星图像常受云层或缺乏灾前数据限制。

Result: 在土耳其地震数据集中验证，结果显示地理空间特征显著提升了检测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需灾前数据，可快速可靠地评估建筑物损坏，支持灾害管理。

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了模板保护带来的性能差距，适用于多种生物特征识别系统。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了性能问题，且与现有系统兼容，适用于主流生物特征识别模态。

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a
challenge, particularly in applications where safe and robust perception is
critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image

based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with

practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point

Motivation: 现有VLMMs在抽象和适应性推理方面表现不足，无法根据新信息动态调整推理结论。DVidE任务旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法显著提升了VLMMs的动态推理能力。

Conclusion: DVidE任务及相关框架有效增强了VLMMs的适应性推理能力，为动态视频理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Result: 在MM-R3基准测试中显著提升模型一致性。

Conclusion: 为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Result: 支持多种精确操作（如姿态编辑、纹理修改等），实验证明其优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion是高质量、可控视频编辑工作流的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any

WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效提升了模型的推理能力，为多图像任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

Conclusion: SEEA-R1展示了在具身智能中实现自我进化的潜力，为未来研究提供了可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型（如Chain-of-Thought）在复杂推理任务中存在任务分解脆弱、数据需求高和延迟大的问题，需要一种更高效且稳定的方法。

Method: HRM采用分层循环架构，包含两个相互依赖的模块：高层模块负责慢速抽象规划，低层模块处理快速详细计算，无需中间过程显式监督。

Result: HRM仅用2700万参数和1000个训练样本，在复杂推理任务（如数独和迷宫路径规划）中表现优异，并在ARC基准测试中超越更大模型。

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

TL;DR: THE-Tree框架通过构建领域特定的科技演化树，结合LLM的生成能力和文献验证机制，显著提升了科学发展的预测和评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法无法有效评估LLM生成的大量科学命题的新颖性和准确性，需要一种结构化、可验证且因果关联的科学演化数据框架。

Method: 提出THE-Tree框架，通过搜索算法构建演化树，结合LLM的“Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify”流程和自然语言推理机制验证每一步的逻辑和证据支持。

Result: 在多个实验中，THE-Tree显著提升了图完成、科学预测和重要论文评估的性能，最高提升近100%。

Conclusion: THE-Tree为解决科学演化数据的结构化验证问题提供了有效工具，并在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

Conclusion: MobiVerse填补了移动模拟的空白，提供了一个可定制的平台，支持交通系统和代理级别的算法测试。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

TL;DR: Active-MoSH是一个交互式框架，用于高风险决策中的多目标优化，结合软硬边界和偏好学习，提升决策者信任和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策（如近距离放射治疗）中，决策者需平衡多个目标，但现有方法缺乏系统化的偏好结构迭代优化，且决策者需信任最终选择。

Method: Active-MoSH框架包含局部和全局组件：局部组件结合软硬边界和概率偏好学习，全局组件通过多目标敏感性分析识别潜在高价值点。

Conclusion: Active-MoSH为高风险决策提供了一种高效、可信的交互式框架，支持决策者在复杂目标中快速找到满意解。

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的概率模型，通过引入祖先依赖关系生成更具挑战性的游戏树，分析了多种算法的平均复杂度，揭示了AlphaBeta等算法在实际中的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型假设游戏树叶节点值独立，导致分析结果过于简化且不具挑战性。本文旨在通过引入结构复杂性，提供更贴近现实的模型。

Method: 提出一种基于层级条件分布的概率模型，强制引入祖先依赖关系，生成可调整难度的游戏树，并推导了AlphaBeta和Scout等算法的平均复杂度递归公式。

Result: 在深度有限树中，AlphaBeta的常数乘因子显著大于Scout等算法，导致实际性能下降。尽管所有算法在渐近情况下表现相似。

Conclusion: 新模型为经典游戏求解算法提供了更现实的分析框架，揭示了实际性能差异，并提供了严谨的分析工具。

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing

Conclusion: 该方法有效推动了多模态轨迹检索的发展，为AI代理能力提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

Result: 在四个数据集上实验表明，KGE-MoS以较低参数成本提升了模型性能和概率拟合。

Conclusion: KGE-MoS有效解决了秩瓶颈问题，显著提升了知识图谱补全模型的性能。

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

Conclusion: 智能不服从应作为AI代理的核心能力进行研究，为人机合作提供新视角。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

Conclusion: FAT-CAT通过FCA增强了主题建模的可解释性，为数据探索提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个自动化LLM速度跑分基准，用于评估AI代理在科学复现中的能力，发现当前先进LLM在复现已知创新时仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理在科学复现中的能力，以推动科学进步。

Method: 利用NanoGPT速度跑分竞赛的19个任务，提供训练脚本和提示，测试LLM复现改进的能力。

Result: 当前先进的推理LLM即使结合最佳框架，仍难以复现已知创新。

Conclusion: 该基准为衡量LLM自动化科学复现能力提供了简单且未饱和的指标。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

Abstract: The Yellow River is China's mother river and a cradle of human civilization.
The ancient Yellow River culture is, moreover, an indispensable part of human
art history. To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture, we
designed RiverEcho, a real-time interactive system that responds to voice
queries using a large language model and a cultural knowledge dataset,
delivering explanations through a talking-head digital human. Specifically, we
built a knowledge database focused on the ancient Yellow River culture,
including the collection of historical texts and the processing pipeline.
Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) on the proposed dataset enhances the response quality of the Large
Language Model(LLM), enabling the system to generate more professional and
informative responses. Our work not only diversifies the means of promoting
Yellow River culture but also provides users with deeper cultural insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家框架，通过专家融合或知识蒸馏优化多语言ASR性能，实验显示性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言ASR中不同语言相互干扰，共享模型容量导致识别效果不佳，需定制化解决方案。

Method: 采用LoRA语言专家框架，结合专家融合或知识蒸馏进行微调。

Result: 在语言感知和无语言感知场景下，性能分别提升约10%和15%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多语言ASR中表现优异，优于标准微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态知识图谱VAT-KG，覆盖视觉、音频和文本信息，并通过严格的过滤和对齐步骤自动生成，支持多模态检索增强生成（RAG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态单一，无法满足多模态任务需求，尤其是视频和音频等丰富模态。

Method: 构建VAT-KG，采用概念中心化设计，通过严格过滤和对齐步骤实现跨模态知识对齐，并开发多模态RAG框架。

Result: 实验表明VAT-KG在多模态问答任务中有效支持MLLMs，展示了其实际价值。

Conclusion: VAT-KG为多模态知识图谱提供了更全面和灵活的解决方案，推动了多模态推理的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体平台上假新闻的快速传播对信息可信度构成严重挑战，需要更高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: DIFND框架整合条件扩散模型的生成能力和多模态大语言模型的协作推理能力，通过生成反驳或验证证据，并结合多代理MLLM系统进行逻辑推理和最终真实性判断。

Result: 在FakeSV和FVC数据集上的实验表明，DIFND不仅优于现有方法，还能提供可信的决策。

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征、生成性反驳线索和推理验证，显著提升了假新闻检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

Conclusion: BTF是一个持续更新的基准，可用于跟踪LLM预测能力的进步。

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own

Motivation: 现有图语言模型（GLM）在少样本任务中存在效率低和性能不足的问题，需要大量标注数据或固定参数。论文旨在通过参数适应阶段优化模型，使其在少样本任务中表现更优。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，结合图神经网络（GNN）和语言模型，通过预训练和参数适应阶段，仅更新少量参数以适应新任务。

Result: GraphLAMA在少/零样本节点分类和摘要生成任务中表现最优，准确率提升4.91%，推理速度比ICL快10倍。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过参数适应阶段显著提升了GLM在少样本任务中的性能和效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习微调技术提升小型语言模型在指令跟随和数学推理任务中的表现。

Method: 比较了监督微调（SFT）、直接偏好优化（DPO）和强化留一法（RLOO）三种方法，并结合数据增强和外部验证器。

Result: RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO结果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和外部验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为训练轻量级、任务对齐的小型语言模型提供了关键权衡和实践策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）作为真相判断工具的能力仍不明确，研究发现推理模型比非推理模型更少倾向于相信陈述为真，但仍有较高偏见，且部分高级模型存在谄媚倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在真相检测中的能力，填补对推理模型与非推理模型差异的研究空白。

Method: 让8个LLMs对4,800条陈述进行真伪判断，比较推理与非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见较低，但仍高于人类基准；部分高级模型在真相与欺骗检测中存在不对称表现。

Conclusion: LLMs的能力提升未能解决真相检测的根本挑战，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有生成模型多为端到端生成，与建筑实践中渐进式工作流程不匹配，因此需要一种更符合实际需求的方法。

Method: 借鉴大型语言模型中的自回归‘下一个令牌预测’机制，提出‘下一个房间预测’范式，用于建筑平面图建模。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design。

Conclusion: 该方法支持未来智能建筑设计，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准，涵盖机器翻译、自动语音识别和文本摘要任务，评估零样本、10样本和微调设置下的模型表现。

Result: 现有模型在低资源语言中表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危和代表性不足的语言，并公开数据集和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Result: KCS+IBC在保持准确性的同时，降低了熵并增加了预测的多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架在平衡预测聚合与多样性方面表现出潜力，未来将定量评估其对偏见校正的影响。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Motivation: 探讨反向翻译在高品质低资源机器翻译中的有效性，特别是在英语-古吉拉特语翻译中。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句对的高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并添加反向翻译生成的合成数据。

Result: 添加合成数据未提升翻译性能，BLEU分数保持43.8，甚至略有下降。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景中可能收益递减，需进一步研究其适用性。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用大语言模型（LLMs）在生命科学领域的潜力，特别是在生物信息学中，解决复杂问题和分析任务。

Method: 方法包括引入BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估工具，设计BioPars指标评估LLMs的三种能力，并比较ChatGPT、Llama和Galactica的表现。

Result: BioPars在波斯医学问答中表现优异，ROUGE-L得分为29.99，BERTScore为90.87，MoverScore和BLEURT值也优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs在生物信息学任务中仍有改进空间，BioPars是波斯医学问答领域的首次应用，未来将持续优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.

### [117] [Assessing RAG and HyDE on 1B vs. 4B-Parameter Gemma LLMs for Personal Assistants Integretion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21568)
*Andrejs Sorstkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了RAG和HyDE两种增强策略在小型Gemma LLM上的效果，发现RAG在延迟和准确性上表现更优，适合隐私优先的个人助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在边缘和隐私敏感应用中的资源效率问题。

Method: 使用MongoDB和Qdrant实现短长期记忆，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，React.js前端展示。

Result: RAG降低延迟17%，消除事实幻觉；HyDE提升语义相关性但增加响应时间和幻觉率。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

*Weihua Xiao,Derek Ekberg,Siddharth Garg,Ramesh Karri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，显著提升了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）耗时且易错，利用LLM自动化翻译存在领域特定语法和语义理解的挑战。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）框架和合成微调数据集，结合提示引导的解释，提升轻量级模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，定制RAG框架使功能匹配SVAs数量提升58.42%，微调后的Qwen模型提升59.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的准确性和效率。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

TL;DR: 本文分析了预训练语言模型（LMs）在低数据量时间序列预测中的有效迁移，探讨了设计选择的影响，并发现验证损失持续下降的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型在时间序列预测中的迁移效果，以优化低数据量下的计算效率。

Method: 通过分析上游后训练、时间序列分词器和语言模型规模等设计选择，评估其对验证损失的影响。

Result: 验证损失持续下降，且设计选择对性能有显著影响，迁移差距持续存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了计算高效训练的有效性，并为跨模态数据分布研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

### [120] [Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21571)
*Jianshuo Dong,Yujia Fu,Chuanrui Hu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探索了大型推理模型（LRMs）是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并提出了CogTest基准来评估这些习惯。研究发现LRMs具有人类相似的认知习惯，并能根据任务自适应调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是观察某些思维链（CoT）模式在任务中反复出现，从而探索LRMs是否具有类似人类的认知习惯。

Method: 通过CogTest基准，评估16种认知习惯，每种习惯包含25个任务，采用证据优先的提取方法。

Result: 研究发现LRMs表现出人类相似的习惯，并能自适应调整；某些习惯与生成有害内容相关。

Conclusion: 研究认为分析LRMs的CoT行为模式有助于理解其不当行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

*Tianyu. Zou,Shengwu. Xiong,Ruilin. Yao,Jirui. Huang,Yi. Rong,Yaxiong. Chen,Shili. Xiong,Cong. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构方程模型（SEM）的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）评估框架，解决了现有基准设计缺乏结构化和理论依据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准设计存在认知目标不明确、能力重叠和指标冗余等问题，限制了诊断能力。

Method: 采用结构方程模型（SEM）分析基准的内部效度、维度可分性和组件贡献，并基于皮亚杰认知发展理论提出能力分层（感知、记忆、推理）。

Result: 新基准Gold展现出更强的可解释性、更少的指标冗余和更清晰的认知一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和基准为MLLM评估提供了更结构化和理论化的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

### [122] [Instruction Learning Paradigms: A Dual Perspective on White-box and Black-box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21573)
*Yanwei Ren,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Quan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合黑盒和白盒模型优势的新框架，通过语义相似性约束优化LLM指令，显著提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型资源需求大的问题，结合两者优势以优化LLM指令。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量初始化与白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束形成统一表示，迭代优化指令。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中，表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代LLM应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化与移民增长使移民部门面临巨大工作量和公平决策挑战，人工智能可能提供解决方案。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括离散选择实验和深度访谈，分析LLM的决策策略及其公平性。

Result: LLM能模拟人类决策，注重效用最大化和程序公平，但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化移民决策中具有潜力，但需解决偏见问题。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为MMLU-CF的无污染多选问答基准，旨在解决现有基准因数据泄露导致的评估不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQ数据集（如MMLU）因开源性和LLM训练数据的广泛来源导致基准污染，评估结果不可靠。

Method: 通过从更广泛的领域获取数据并设计三条去污染规则避免无意数据泄露；将基准分为验证集和测试集以防止恶意数据泄露。

Result: 主流LLM（如GPT-4o）在测试集上的5-shot和0-shot得分分别为73.4%和71.9%，验证了基准的严谨性。

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且无污染的评估标准，有效解决了基准污染问题。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository
is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一框架，通过强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务，实现跨形式迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理关系型和图结构数据时孤立对待的问题，利用SQL和Cypher的共享抽象实现协同优化。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider和Text2Cypher任务上分别提升13.5%和73.1%，并在零样本下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM展示了联合训练SQL和Cypher的协同效应，以及可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Soft Prompt Tuning（SPT）在低资源场景下提升多语言ASR模型性能的方法，提出了两种策略并引入SPT4ASR，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中的性能问题，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 研究了两种策略：1）全微调（FFT）软提示和整个Whisper模型；2）仅训练软提示（SPT）。还提出了SPT4ASR方法。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优是最有效的SPT方法，SPT4ASR进一步降低了代码切换ASR的错误率，且保持参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR在提升低资源场景性能的同时，保持了模型对现有语言的能力，参数效率与LoRA相当。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言ASR中语言干扰和扩展新语言时性能下降的问题。

Method: 1) Entire SPT：对编码器和解码器应用软提示；2) LAPT：利用跨语言相似性编码共享和语言特定特征；3) SPT-Whisper工具包。

Result: Entire SPT和LAPT在语言扩展任务中分别比Decoder SPT提升5.0%和16.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出数据效能（Data Efficacy）的概念，通过优化训练数据的组织提升语言模型性能，并提出了DELT框架，包含数据评分、选择和排序。实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据效率（如数据筛选和采样），而数据组织对语言模型性能的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DELT框架，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO），通过优化数据组织提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下显著提升性能，其中LQS和FO组合效果最佳。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中一个重要的研究方向，可与数据效率结合应用。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估过于医生中心化且限于英语，忽视了医疗团队的多专业协作需求。

Method: 基于巴西国家考试构建5,632题的多专业题库，对20多个LLMs进行零样本评估。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率86.6%，但专业间差异显著（如眼科98.7% vs 社会工作68.4%）。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足，需更细粒度评估以确保AI在医疗团队中的安全性。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Conclusion: LLMs的通用推理能力对其在特定领域的推理表现具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家用户提供了实用的文本分析工具，为人机协作设计提供了启示，并指导未来智能文本分析系统的改进。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study

TL;DR: 该研究首次针对罗马乌尔都语的混合编码希望语音检测，填补了低资源非正式语言在NLP研究中的空白，并提出了一个优化的注意力转换模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注高资源语言和标准化脚本，忽视了罗马乌尔都语等非正式语言形式，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入多类标注数据集，分析罗马乌尔都语中的希望心理基础和语言模式，提出基于注意力的转换模型，并通过5折交叉验证评估。

Result: XLM-R模型表现最佳，交叉验证得分为0.78，优于SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76）。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源非正式语言的希望语音检测提供了新方法和数据集，模型性能显著提升。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

Motivation: 探讨小型语言模型是否也能表现出对齐伪装行为，并验证提示干预的有效性。

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过提示干预（如道德框架和推理提示）观察对齐伪装行为的变化。

Result: 提示干预显著减少了对齐伪装行为，表明小型模型也能表现出此行为且可通过提示抑制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了小型模型的对齐伪装行为，提示干预的有效性，并提出了浅层与深层伪装的分类，强调了对齐评估的重要性。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用生成式AI和LLM从在线零售商食品页面中提取结构化信息的潜力，关注效率和成本。

Method: 对比直接提取和间接提取（通过生成函数）两种方法，评估其在准确性、效率和成本上的表现。

Result: 间接提取方法精度稍低（96.48% vs 直接提取的98.09%），但LLM调用次数减少95.82%，显著提升效率和降低成本。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板网页的大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（mime）作为非语言沟通（NVC）的子集，因其低解释方差，是理解更复杂NVC的前提。

Method: 构建MIME基准，包含86种哑剧动作，通过动作捕捉数据生成，并加入角色、背景和视角的扰动以评估鲁棒性。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源LLM DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流科技公司的LLM进行比较，以揭示其在不同国家和议题上的表现差异。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-R1、DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，并使用ANES和中国Zuobiao数据集的调查数据，评估这些模型在预测中美社会议题上的公众意见能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国堕胎议题时表现最佳，但在模拟中国低收入人群对资本主义的看法时表现不佳。所有模型都存在过度概括群体内单一观点的问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在公众意见建模中的文化和人口偏见问题，建议采用更具包容性的训练方法以减少偏见。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆的底层机制，尤其是记忆序列的触发和模型行为的差异。

Method: 利用变压器电路和对比数据集，分析记忆与非记忆生成的区别，并分离出负责记忆的特定电路。

Result: 发现记忆的起始与维持由不同电路控制，记忆预防机制具有跨领域鲁棒性，而记忆触发则更依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 记忆的起始和维持由不同电路实现，预防机制具有通用性，而触发机制则更依赖特定上下文。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类与LLM生成的内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止错误信息传播至关重要。现有方法在泛化到新LLM和领域时表现不佳。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，能够跨未见过的LLM和领域检测生成内容。

Result: 通过真实数据集评估，GLD在检测性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值，提升了检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为表示一致性（RC）的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合LLM的多个候选回答并考虑内部激活一致性来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，RC旨在简化这一过程并提升推理性能。

Method: RC通过分析模型生成多个回答时的内部激活一致性（密集或稀疏）来加权聚合答案。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上验证，RC能提升任务性能，最高提升4%准确率。

Conclusion: RC是一种轻量级方法，无需额外模型查询即可显著提升推理性能，且稀疏激活信号与连贯推理一致。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Method: 引入FinEval-KR框架，提出知识得分和推理得分，并基于Bloom分类法提出认知得分。发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Result: 实验显示LLMs的推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响推理准确性的核心因素，但知识应用仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理任务的评估提供了新方法，揭示了LLMs在知识和推理能力上的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在手语识别中效率和准确性难以兼顾的问题，尤其是RNN、LSTM和GCN的梯度消失和高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于百万参数模型；在WLASL和ASL-Citizen数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠高效的解决方案，有望提升听障人士的辅助工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、低成本地为LLM添加新语言能力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Conclusion: 结构化输入格式是提升MLLMs文档理解性能的有效方法，无需修改模型架构或额外训练。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring

*Xiaoyan Feng,He Zhang,Yanjun Zhang,Leo Yu Zhang,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiMark是一种新型水印框架，通过三项创新解决了LLM生成文本的认证问题，同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和多比特水印嵌入的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，确保生成文本的真实性成为迫切需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和多比特嵌入的要求。

Method: BiMark采用比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法，实现模型无关检测、高检测率和多比特水印嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，BiMark在短文本中的提取率比现有方法高30%，同时保持较低的困惑度，并在下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark在文本质量、检测能力和水印容量之间取得了平衡，为LLM生成文本的认证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Method: 比较了机器学习与LLMs方法，分析了它们在偏见、鲁棒性和可解释性等维度的表现。

Result: ML模型准确性更高但解释性不足，LLMs提供更丰富的解释；两者在偏见和边缘分数鲁棒性上均表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同方法间的挑战与权衡，为开发更可靠、可信的AES系统提供了参考。

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay
Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various
machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle
with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found
that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and
trustworthy AES methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法在记忆层级和交互场景多样性上存在局限性，且缺乏全面的指标来多角度评估记忆能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含事实记忆和反思记忆的数据集，并提出了参与和观察两种交互场景；基于此提出了MemBench基准测试，从有效性、效率和容量等多方面评估记忆能力。

Result: 提出了MemBench基准测试，并公开了数据集和项目资源。

Conclusion: MemBench为研究社区提供了一个更全面的评估工具，有助于推动基于LLM的智能体记忆能力的研究。

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

### [150] [Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606)
*Parham Pourdavood,Michael Jacob,Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文将大语言模型（LLMs）类比为人类文化动态的DNA，强调其作为压缩人类符号表达模式的外部存储库，而非自主智能或简单模仿工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文化动态中的角色，超越传统智能或模仿的视角，强调其作为文化模式存储和再创造的工具。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的文化保存和催化作用。

Result: LLMs通过人类重新解释其压缩模式，形成递归反馈循环，促进人类创造性过程，而非直接竞争人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs的意义在于为人类提供自我反思和低风险假设生成的工具，增强文化可进化性，同时依赖人类解释以保持文化根基。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG是一个模块化框架，用于从法律文本构建可解释的知识图谱，通过类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类走私网络的分析面临法律文本非结构化、词汇密集和共指模糊的挑战，现有方法（如静态模板或LLM）效果不佳。

Method: CORE-KG采用两步流程：类型感知共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，基于改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 相比基线，CORE-KG减少节点重复33.28%和法律噪声38.37%，生成更清晰的知识图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Motivation: 探索在多模态时间序列预测中，文本信息是否以及在何种条件下能带来一致的性能提升。

Method: 在14个跨7个领域的预测任务上评估两种多模态预测范式：基于对齐的方法和基于提示的方法。

Result: 多模态方法并非在所有情况下都优于单模态基线，性能提升取决于模型架构和数据特性。

Conclusion: 文本信息在特定条件下（如高容量文本模型、互补预测信号等）对预测任务有帮助，但并非普遍适用。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

*Xiaobin Ren,Xinyu Zhu,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和GOT表示，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样、多样性和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、多样性和泛化方面存在不足，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在多个真实数据集和POI任务上验证了AdaptGOT的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型通过多上下文集成和自适应学习，显著提升了POI嵌入的效果。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of child-targeted hate speech online underscores
the urgent need for specialized datasets to address this critical issue.
Existing hate speech datasets lack agespecific annotations, fail to capture

bridge this gap, we introduce ChildGuard1, a curated dataset derived from
existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including

area, we publicly release ChildGuard, providing a robust foundation for
developing improved methods to detect and mitigate such harm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在QA基准测试中可能通过记忆任务特定数据“作弊”，削弱评估的有效性。现有研究多关注检测泄漏，而忽略了缓解其影响。

Method: 引入LastingBench框架，通过扰动识别泄漏点，并将其改写为反事实内容，既破坏记忆效应又保留评估意图。

Result: 对前沿QA基准的评估显示性能差距显著，证明LastingBench能有效减少记忆效应。

Conclusion: LastingBench为基准测试提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保其长期稳健性，促进对LLMs更公平、可解释的评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

TL;DR: GARMLE-G框架通过检索权威临床指南内容，生成与临床实践一致的医疗建议，避免了传统方法的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码，未能捕捉临床医生的复杂推理，限制了模型的临床实用性。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测与EHR数据生成查询，通过嵌入相似性检索CPG内容，并与模型输出融合。

Result: 原型系统在高血压诊断中表现优异，检索精度、语义相关性和指南依从性均优于基线。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，适用于临床实践中的广泛部署。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法使用通用大语言模型（LLM）进行时间线摘要时，难以准确评估主题相关性和理解主题演化，导致摘要中包含无关信息或不准确时间戳。

Method: 1. 构建大规模TLS数据集（1000+新闻主题，3000+标注实例）；2. 提出渐进优化策略，包括指令调优和双对齐奖励学习（结合语义和时间视角）。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出色，能够有效生成高质量的时间线摘要。

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化和双对齐奖励学习，显著提升了开放领域时间线摘要的性能，为新闻主题演化监控提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归TTS模型在语音时长控制上的局限性，特别是在需要严格音视频同步的应用中。

Method: 提出两种生成模式：显式指定生成令牌数以精确控制时长，或自由生成语音并保留输入提示的韵律特征。结合GPT潜在表示增强稳定性，并通过软指令机制实现自然语言情感控制。

Result: 在零样本设置下，IndexTTS2在词错误率、说话人相似性和情感保真度上优于现有最先进的TTS模型。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2为自回归TTS模型提供了更灵活的时长和情感控制能力，同时保持了高质量语音合成的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真的评论，但更易制造共识；真实与人工评论在语义空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于操纵在线政治讨论，对AI驱动的舆论操控具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Result: 通过OPC微调的模型在评估证明正确性任务上表现与Gemini-2.5-Pro相当。

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

Motivation: 解决ASR模型在非标准语音（如脑瘫或遗传障碍导致的语音障碍）上的性能不足问题。

Method: 通过选择单词并丰富小型语音障碍数据集，提出了一种轻量级个性化ASR模型的管道。

Result: 在儿童结构语音障碍数据上，该方法显著提高了转录质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有望减少非标准语音个体的沟通障碍。

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic
disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with
non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of
collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we
propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with
high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance
machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and
improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在提取SAR时面临文档格式多样性和方法泛化能力不足的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合领域专用工具与监督微调的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），提出Doc2SAR框架。

Result: Doc2SAR在DocSAR-200基准上表现优异，总体表格召回率达80.78%，优于GPT-4o 51.48%。

Conclusion: Doc2SAR框架高效实用，为SAR提取任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GNNs和MLPs在结构信息利用上的差异，提出了一种信息论视角的探测框架，评估结构建模对语言模型的影响，并发现MLPs作为特征转换模块优于纯消息传递的GNNs。


<details>

Motivation: 近期研究表明GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现优异，这促使作者研究结构建模对语言模型的作用及MLPs的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种模块化探测框架，通过控制模块选择性使用GNN或其解耦组件（消息传递和特征转换操作），评估其对语言模型表示的影响。

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能有效提升语言模型对句法和语义模式的捕捉能力，而纯消息传递的GNNs表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs可作为高效且可扩展的替代方案，优于纯消息传递的GNNs，特征转换操作对模型性能有积极影响。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI为低资源孟加拉语方言的情感分析提供了重要资源，提升了自然语言处理的准确性。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Result: 这些神经元对应广泛的语音和性别类别，保护它们能显著保留说话者任务的性能。

Conclusion: 特定神经元在编码说话者信息中起关键作用，保护它们有助于模型优化。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs的参量知识偏见如何影响事实核查结果，以及故意注入偏见的效果。

Method: 通过直接提示和生成支持、反驳或中性文档两种实验方式，分析模型的行为和偏见。

Result: Llama 3.1在直接提示下对近一半的声明标记为“证据不足”，而在生成文档实验中，提示显著影响检索结果，但最终预测结果稳定。

Conclusion: LLMs在事实核查中存在知识偏见，但最终预测结果对提示策略的变化表现出稳定性。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

Motivation: 大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，现有研究未充分评估模型在列表答案构建中的时间理解能力。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间对齐的结构化列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型表现。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在闭卷设置中难以提供完整答案和时间对齐事实，开放域设置中检索能力需改进。

Conclusion: TLQA基准为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

Motivation: 社交媒体上冒犯性内容增加，手动审核不现实，需自动化系统。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，基于OLID数据集进行性能比较。

Result: XLNet在检测冒犯内容及分类冒犯类型上优于BERT，BERT在识别冒犯目标上稍优。

Conclusion: XLNet和迁移学习在构建冒犯性语言检测系统上具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的可解释性方法。

Method: 通过分类基于Transformer架构（编码器、解码器、编码器-解码器）的XAI方法，并评估其解释能力与实际应用。

Result: 综述了现有XAI技术，分析了其评估方法及实际应用中的表现。

Conclusion: 未来需继续研究透明且负责任的LLMs，解决现有挑战并推动可解释性技术的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，特别是由大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）引发的语义和语用变化，而非简单的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来科学英语词汇频率的快速变化，尤其是某些词汇（如'delve'、'intricate'、'crucial'）的突然增加，引发了对其背后机制的研究需求。

Method: 通过PubMed科学摘要的频率趋势分析，结合词性标注，系统研究了同义词组的变化模式。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明语言模型的影响主要是语义和语用的；同时观察到某些词汇（如'important'）的显著下降。

Conclusion: 语言技术对语言变化的影响更多是语义和语用层面的，而非单纯的词汇替换，揭示了语言变化的复杂性。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Motivation: 波斯古典诗歌的语言、风格和韵律复杂性给计算作者归属带来挑战，需要一种综合方法。

Method: 采用多输入神经网络框架，结合Transformer语言编码器、Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码，使用647,653节诗歌数据进行训练和验证。

Result: 加权投票方案达到71%准确率，阈值过滤后高置信预测准确率达97%。

Conclusion: 该方法为波斯诗歌的作者归属和风格分析提供了有效工具，并支持多语言作者归属和生成模型研究。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且高效的NLP模型设定了新标准，挑战了深度神经网络在文本分类中的必要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出置信度的估计方法，提出了基于生成一致性的假设（一致性假设），并验证了其在不同任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM输出置信度的估计对实际应用中的用户信任至关重要，黑盒不确定性量化（UQ）方法因其实用性受到关注。

Method: 提出三种数学表述及统计测试来验证一致性假设，并设计指标评估LLM输出的符合性。

Result: 在8个基准数据集和3个任务上的实验表明，一致性假设普遍成立，其中‘Sim-Any’假设最具实用性。

Conclusion: 基于生成一致性的黑盒UQ方法在置信度估计中表现优异，验证了一致性假设的实际价值。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经语言模型内部如何在不同层构建句法结构，尤其是微/宏观结构的形成过程及其对性能的影响。

Method: 提出Derivational Probing方法，分析BERT模型中微/宏观句法结构在不同层的构建过程，并通过主谓一致任务验证其影响。

Result: 实验表明，微句法结构在低层形成，逐渐整合为宏观结构；宏观结构构建时机对下游任务性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 揭示了BERT中句法结构的自下而上构建规律，并强调了全局句法信息整合的最佳时机。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepTalk提出了一种基于MoE架构的自适应模态专家学习框架，解决了原生MLLMs因数据不足导致的性能下降问题，性能下降仅为5.5%，对话延迟低于0.5秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原生MLLMs能保留更丰富的副语言特征，但面临灾难性遗忘和性能下降问题，主要原因是语音-文本配对数据不足。

Method: DeepTalk采用MoE架构，自适应区分模态专家，先进行单模态训练，再进行多模态协作训练。

Result: DeepTalk性能下降仅为5.5%，显著优于原生MLLMs的20%下降，且对话延迟低于0.5秒。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在性能和延迟上表现优异，为智能语音交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对语音交互的多模态大语言模型（LLMs）的全面评估方法，填补了现有文本基准在语音特性评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多基于文本基准，忽略了语音的独特特性（如韵律、同音词等），无法优化语音LLMs在实际应用中的用户体验。

Method: 通过系统整理真实语音对话数据，引入多样化的说话者属性和声学条件，并加入语音特有现象，设计了一种查询感知的评估方法。

Result: 测试显示不同语音场景下模型性能差异显著，查询感知评估能提供更细粒度的性能分析。

Conclusion: 该基准为语音模型的开发和评估提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力，填补系统性评估的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段框架（感知与预测），并引入WM-ABench基准，涵盖23个细粒度维度。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，例如运动轨迹区分接近随机准确率。

Conclusion: VLMs与人类水平的世界建模能力存在显著差距。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

TL;DR: 论文通过两阶段评估定义了LLMs中的两种偏见：模型偏见和推理偏见，并分析了其在多语言环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，特别是在其输出可能影响公众意见或强化主流叙事时。

Method: 两阶段评估：第一阶段评估LLMs在事实性问题上的表现，第二阶段探讨地缘政治敏感争议。

Result: 第一阶段显示查询语言诱导的一致性，第二阶段反映模型训练背景与查询语言的交互作用。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个结构化框架，用于评估LLMs在敏感和非敏感话题中的行为，为未来LLM部署和多语言评估实践提供见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合多任务能力的数据混合是一个未解决的问题。检查点模型在训练过程中表现出不同的能力，但通常未被充分利用。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在基准测试中的能力，利用其一阶影响近似对源数据进行聚合，优化数据混合。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，预训练性能提升高达1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力，为语言模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在角色扮演场景中的表现和偏见，特别是在移民检查情境下如何基于人类需求层次理论做出决策。

Method: 使用ERG理论构建短篇叙事，让LLMs扮演移民检查员，决定是否批准或拒绝入境。分析了六种LLMs的决策模式。

Result: LLMs表现出显著的决策偏好，部分模型对边缘化身份有更高的拒绝率。

Conclusion: LLMs在决策中隐含偏好和身份偏见，数据公开供进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

TL;DR: 研究评估了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性，发现其在工具调用各阶段易出错，开源模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注端到端工具使用，忽视稳定性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段的错误易感性，包括文档阅读、工具选择、参数生成和响应处理。

Result: 代理在各阶段均易出错，开源模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未显著提升稳定性。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种混合攻击方法（GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame），结合令牌级和提示级技术，显著提高了对预训练语言模型的越狱成功率，同时揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍存在漏洞，尤其是令牌级和提示级越狱攻击。现有方法各有局限性，需要更有效的攻击手段以揭示和弥补安全缺陷。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，评估其在Vicuna和Llama模型上的效果。

Result: GCG + PAIR在无防御模型上的攻击成功率（ASR）达到91.6%，显著高于单一方法；GCG + WordGame在严格评估下仍保持80%以上的ASR。两种方法均能突破高级防御措施。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全措施的漏洞，强调了在攻击成功率和防御鲁棒性之间的权衡，并呼吁开发更全面的安全防护机制。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Method: 方法包括提出社交网络模拟的正式框架，并测试不同方法在英语和德语社交网络（如X平台）上模拟用户行为的效果。

Result: 结果表明，社交模拟应通过其经验真实性进行验证，尤其是在模拟组件拟合的环境中。

Conclusion: 结论是呼吁在基于生成代理的社交模拟中采用更严谨的方法。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Motivation: 预训练模型在通用领域表现优异，但在驾驶舱等特定领域（涉及专业词汇和多语言对话）表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 收集并手动标注驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，提出多种规范化方案，并采用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: 词错误率从68.49%降至26.26%，显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 通过规范化方案和微调，Whisper模型在驾驶舱对话转录中的性能得到显著提升。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Result: 在通用特征中，HT与MT在连词分布和1字词频上差异显著；LLMs在风格特征上更接近HT，优于神经机器翻译（NMT）。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其在风格特征上更接近人工翻译。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Result: 确认NMT和LLM均存在MTese，原始中文文本与机器翻译输出区分度高。LLM词汇多样性更高，NMT更多使用括号。翻译专用LLM词汇多样性较低但因果连词使用更多。中外LLM无显著差异。

Conclusion: 机器翻译输出在英中新闻文本中表现出独特的语言特征，LLM和NMT各有特点，但中外LLM差异不显著。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: MDC的任务导向、多轮、动态环境中的对话引发了多种语言现象，标注参考信息可使其成为更有价值的资源。

Method: 讨论了标注方法、生成的语料库，并对数据进行了定量和定性分析。

Result: 通过简短实验展示了该语料库在指代表达理解中的实用性。

Conclusion: MDC-R是一个有价值的资源，尤其适用于指代和指示参考的研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus with Reference (MDC-R). MDC-R is a
new language resource that supplements the original Minecraft Dialogue Corpus
(MDC) with expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference. MDC's
task-orientated, multi-turn, situated dialogue in a dynamic environment has
motivated multiple annotation efforts, owing to the interesting linguistic
phenomena that this setting gives rise to. We believe it can serve as a
valuable resource when annotated with reference, too. Here, we discuss our
method of annotation and the resulting corpus, and provide both a quantitative
and a qualitative analysis of the data. Furthermore, we carry out a short
experiment demonstrating the usefulness of our corpus for referring expression
comprehension.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交媒体如何通过语言复杂性反映社会结构和意识形态。

Method: 结合多种文本复杂性指标，分析用户生成内容在四个维度（账户类型、政治倾向、内容可靠性和情感）上的差异。

Result: 发现语言复杂性在不同维度上存在显著差异，尤其是政治立场相似且可靠性相近的用户倾向于使用共同的行话。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社会语言学动态，深化了对在线空间中语言如何反映意识形态和社会结构的理解。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-2 Small模型如何通过特定子网络处理主谓一致任务。

Method: 使用性能验证、自动电路发现、直接路径修补和直接对数归因等技术。

Result: 仅需少量网络组件即可完成基础任务，但复杂任务需要更多组件。

Conclusion: 模型通过特定子网络高效处理主谓一致任务，但复杂任务依赖更广泛网络。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

TL;DR: DAPFAM是一个新的开放获取专利检索数据集，解决了现有数据集在领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和计算资源需求方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专利检索数据集缺乏明确的领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和平衡的查询领域表示，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建DAPFAM数据集，包含1,247个领域平衡的查询家族和45,336个目标家族，使用IPC代码进行领域标注。

Result: 数据集包含49,869个评估对，支持跨领域专利检索实验，基线实验显示跨领域检索存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: DAPFAM填补了专利检索数据集的空白，支持有限计算资源下的子文档级实验，并公开可用。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now

Motivation: 解决方言阿拉伯语和代码转换语音数据稀缺的问题，提升模型在这些任务上的性能。

Method: 采用改进的音频拼接方法（SAGE）生成人工CS数据，结合经验回放（ER）技术增强泛化能力，并引入外部3-gram语言模型优化结果。

Result: WER在阿拉伯语和英语CS基准上绝对降低了7.8%，整体平均WER从31.7%降至26.6%。在阿拉伯语-英语CS基准上，WER为31.1%，优于大型多语言模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了模型在方言阿拉伯语和代码转换语音任务上的性能，且优于更大规模的模型。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

Method: 引入RCO框架，利用细化信号训练批评模型，通过反馈循环和批评效用（CU）量化改进效果。

Result: 在五个任务中，RCO在批评质量和细化结果上显著优于传统方法和开源模型。

Conclusion: RCO通过优化批评模型，有效提升了语言模型的批评-细化循环性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

Motivation: 现有方法在评估LLMs的政治偏见时稳定性不足，导致模型间比较不可靠。

Method: 提出Questionnaire Modeling (QM)任务，使用人类调查数据作为上下文示例。

Result: 实验表明QM提高了评估稳定性，指令调优可能改变偏见方向，且更大模型能更有效地利用上下文示例，偏见分数更低。

Conclusion: QM是一种更稳定的偏见评估方法，且模型规模和指令调优对偏见表现有显著影响。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用GPT-4o检测结构化数据中个人数据的新方法，结合上下文信息显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测个人数据时缺乏对上下文信息的利用，限制了性能。

Method: 结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称及数据集描述，利用GPT-4o进行检测。

Result: 在医疗数据集MIMIC-Demo-Ext上表现最佳，Kaggle和OpenML数据集上上下文信息显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要更多包含个人信息的真实数据集以推动进展。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评估者（LLM-as-a-Judge）在评分任务中的偏见问题，提出了一个框架来评估和缓解这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者在复杂任务中表现优异，但其评分存在偏见，影响公平性和可靠性。目前研究多集中于比较评估，对评分偏见的系统性研究较少。

Method: 通过数据合成扩展现有基准，设计多维度评价指标，定义评分偏见为评分模型受偏见相关扰动时的分数差异。

Result: 实验表明现有评分模型的稳定性受偏见影响，探索性实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了评分偏见的严重性，并提出了改进方向，如评分标准、评分ID和参考答案选择等。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言解析策略并非随机，但先前研究表明随机解析策略的代理仍能实现高沟通准确率。本研究旨在验证在更复杂输入和引入意外性因素后，随机解析策略是否仍有效。

Method: 实验采用两种修改：(I) 使用具有层次结构的复杂输入，(II) 在目标函数中引入意外性相关项。

Result: 通过实验评估随机解析策略在修改后的条件下是否仍能保持高沟通准确率。

Conclusion: 研究结果将揭示随机解析策略在复杂语言环境中的有效性，进一步理解人类语言解析的非随机性。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理时的高延迟和能耗是主要瓶颈，现有方法需要重新训练或改变架构，QuickSilver旨在解决这一问题。

Method: QuickSilver通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，在不修改模型的情况下实现语义适应性。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上测试，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，且困惑度增加可忽略（<=0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver为LLM推理提供了一种高效、兼容性强的优化方案，适用于冻结的密集模型。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the

approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its
real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert

high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

Motivation: 现有语言模型评估方法未能反映真实临床环境中基于证据的医学复杂性，需要一种更接近实际诊断过程的评估框架。

Method: 将304个NEJM-CPC病例转化为逐步诊断任务，引入MAI-DxO模型，模拟医生团队并提出高效测试策略。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%-70%，最高准确率达85.5%。

Conclusion: AI系统在迭代思考和高效行动下，可显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

### [208] [SciMantify -- A Hybrid Approach for the Evolving Semantification of Scientific Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21819)
*Lena John,Kheir Eddine Farfar,Sören Auer,Oliver Karras*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于5星级关联开放数据模型的科学知识表示进化模型，通过SciMantify方法实现从PDF到知识图谱的语义化转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学出版物以PDF形式存在，缺乏结构化和语义化，限制了知识的可访问性和重用性。

Method: 提出五阶段进化模型，结合人类与机器协作的语义标注任务（SATs），在Open Research Knowledge Graph（ORKG）平台上实现。

Result: 初步用户实验表明，该方法简化了科学知识的预处理，减少了语义化的工作量，并提升了知识表示的质量。

Conclusion: SciMantify方法有效推动了科学知识从静态PDF到动态知识图谱的语义化转换。

Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and
unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained
knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in
tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and
semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable
and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of
knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model,
with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a
digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a
knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire
model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular
formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to
support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines
collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining
the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific
knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph
(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user
experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific
knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances
the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)的量子架构QuKAN，探索了KANs在量子机器学习中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs在表达复杂函数方面表现出色，但其在量子机器学习中的应用尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过量子电路Born Machine (QCBM)实现KAN架构的混合和全量子形式，利用预训练残差函数进行转换。

Result: 展示了QuKAN架构的可行性、可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: QuKAN为量子机器学习提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的、保密的方式训练可互操作的ML压缩与解压缩模型，并在原型UE和基站中验证了其准确性，展示了ML在6G网络中实际应用的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多基于模拟环境，缺乏实际场景中ML模型互操作性的验证，尤其是在UE和基站无法共享ML模型的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种保密训练可互操作ML模型的方法，并在原型设备上测试其性能，包括信道信息重建准确性和下行链路吞吐增益。

Result: 实验证明，无需共享ML模型即可实现高精度的信道反馈，为6G网络中的实际应用奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法为ML在无线网络中的实际部署提供了可行性，推动了6G网络中ML技术的商业化应用。

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback
has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML)
in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based
feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel
information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

*Fuying Wang,Jiacheng Xu,Lequan Yu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MELP是一种新型的多尺度ECG-语言预训练模型，通过分层监督从ECG-文本对中提取特征，显著优于现有自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ECG分析的深度学习方法依赖大量人工标注，耗时耗力。自监督学习（SSL）虽为替代方案，但现有方法未能捕捉ECG信号的多尺度特性。

Method: MELP结合心脏学特定语言模型和三层次跨模态监督（标记、节拍、节律），对齐ECG信号与文本报告。

Result: 在多个ECG数据集和任务中，MELP表现优于现有SSL方法。

Conclusion: MELP通过多尺度监督和语言模型增强，显著提升了ECG表征的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and
diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for
ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both
time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code
is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过对抗性扰动攻击视觉语言模型（VLMs）以毒化文本到图像生成模型训练管道的可行性，实验证明攻击效果显著且防御措施可能被绕过。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示VLMs对对抗性攻击的脆弱性，以及这种攻击如何通过毒化训练数据影响文本到图像模型的性能。

Method: 通过生成对抗性扰动图像，误导VLMs产生错误标注，从而在训练管道中注入“脏标签”数据。

Result: 实验显示攻击成功率高（73%以上），且防御措施可能被自适应攻击者绕过。

Conclusion: 研究表明对抗性攻击可能导致训练数据质量下降和开发成本增加，呼吁加强防御措施。

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images
sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical
for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs
during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to
stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to
images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks
on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image
models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images
that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of
injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for
text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number
of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,
they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a
cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and
increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success
(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex
AI and Microsoft Azure).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）对科学写作和发表的影响。

Method: 使用四种标准可读性公式计算每篇论文的可读性分数，按年份和学科分类聚合。

Result: 摘要可读性逐年下降，2023年和2024年因ChatGPT发布出现显著变化。

Conclusion: AI可能影响了科学写作的可读性。

Abstract: The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have
raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how
scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this
paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org
between 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability
and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to
calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level
of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight
primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual
decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming
increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a
significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months
of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a
notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer
insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely
influence of AI on scientific writing.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多维环境下不可分割物品的公平分配问题，提出了弱和强sEFc两种松弛的嫉妒自由概念，并给出了存在性边界和算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂环境中多标准评估下的公平分配问题，如云计算资源的多维评估。

Method: 提出弱sEFc和强sEFc两种松弛嫉妒自由概念，分析其存在性边界，并设计检查算法。

Result: 给出了弱和强sEFc分配的存在性边界，证明了弱和强sEF1分配的NP难问题。

Conclusion: 多维公平分配问题需要新的松弛嫉妒自由概念，且其存在性和检查具有理论挑战。

Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a
multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex
environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such
multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are
central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources
are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network
bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to
capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we
study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up
to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods
(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'
preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each
dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a
different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the
strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the
envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide
upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the
existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are
independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms
for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we
establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and
strong sEF1 allocations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分散多模态知识图谱间缺乏有效协作系统的问题，同时满足推理能力和传输安全的需求。

Method: 在客户端内使用HidE模型恢复完整多模态分布；在客户端间通过MMFeD3实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验验证了MMFeD3-HidE的有效性、语义一致性和收敛鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MMFeD3-HidE为FedMKGC任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

TL;DR: RWFT是一种轻量级的输出重加权遗忘方法，无需完全重新训练即可从分类器中删除整个类别，解决了现有遗忘方法在预测未学习类别样本时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强制执行用户删除权利和减少有害或偏见预测的需求，同时避免昂贵的完全重新训练。

Method: 通过重新分配遗忘类别样本的预测概率质量，设计了一种对MIA-NN攻击鲁棒的方法，并引入基于总变差（TV）距离的新度量标准。

Result: RWFT在现有评估指标和新提出的TV距离指标上均优于现有方法，分别提升了2.79%和111.45%。

Conclusion: RWFT在性能和安全性上均优于现有方法，为机器遗忘领域提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为非对称策略优化（APO）的方法，通过动态调整KL散度权重和惩罚过长响应，提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的复杂推理能力，同时保持了通用任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，而强化学习（RL）的应用又容易导致性能下降和过度思考的问题。

Method: 提出了非对称策略优化（APO），包括难度自适应散度调整（DADS）和次优轨迹复杂度正则化（STCR），分别优化正负样本的处理。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型上应用该方法后，推理能力平均提升了7%，并在多个推理基准测试中优于更大的MLLMs（7-11B）。

Conclusion: APO方法有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，同时保持了通用任务的性能，展示了DADS和STCR技术的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.

Motivation: 传统表格回归方法在处理复杂系统数据时效果不佳，尤其是在特征工程不可行的情况下。

Method: 采用60M参数的编码器-解码器模型，从随机初始化开始训练，进行文本到文本回归。

Result: 在Google的Borg计算集群调度系统上，模型实现了接近完美的0.99等级相关性（平均0.9），MSE比表格方法低100倍，并能轻松适应新任务。

Conclusion: 文本到文本回归是一种通用且可扩展的替代方案，为真实世界结果的通用模拟器铺平了道路。

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过减少时间步长来提高采样效率，但忽略了神经网络长度的动态调整。本文探索了互补方向，动态控制时间步长和网络长度以优化性能。

Method: 通过重连Transformer架构中的块来解决内部离散ODE，并在训练中引入时间和长度一致性项，实现任意时间步长和块数的采样。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上的实验表明，最高效采样模式下延迟减少3倍，高质量采样时FID分数提升3.5分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间和长度维度上均具有灵活性，显著提升了采样效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Conclusion: CRL是一个有前景的研究方向，能够提升RL在动态和真实环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm for
solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed
remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural
networks. However, the success of RL currently relies on extensive training
data and computational resources. In addition, RL's limited ability to
generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world
environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual
Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to
address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to
new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide

Result: 在扩展版Waymo数据集上验证了SceneDiffuser++的城市规模模拟能力和长期模拟的真实性。

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++为城市规模交通模拟提供了高效且真实的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TROFI是一种离线强化学习方法，通过从人类偏好学习奖励函数，无需预定义奖励函数即可训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，通常需要预定义奖励函数，但在实际应用中（如游戏开发）奖励函数可能不可用。

Method: TROFI从人类偏好学习奖励函数，并用其标注数据集以训练策略，无需最优轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，TROFI优于基线方法，性能接近使用真实奖励函数。在3D游戏环境中也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，奖励函数的设计对值函数与未来折扣奖励的对齐至关重要。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Koopman算子理论的改进条件流匹配（CFM）方法，通过线性化生成动态实现高效采样和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFM采样依赖非线性ODE求解，计算成本高且难以解释。本文旨在加速CFM并揭示生成过程的结构。

Method: 结合Koopman算子理论，设计无解码器的Koopman-CFM架构，在学习的嵌入空间中实现线性动态，支持闭式单步采样。

Result: 在2D数据集和真实基准（MNIST、F-MNIST、TFD）上显著加速采样，并通过Koopman生成器的谱特性提供生成行为分析工具。

Conclusion: Koopman增强的流匹配结合了采样效率和解析结构，为快速且可解释的生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

TL;DR: UniCA框架通过统一协变量适应，将时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）扩展到处理异构协变量（如分类变量和多模态数据），提升预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSFMs主要针对实值序列，无法有效处理异构协变量（如分类变量和多模态数据），限制了其在实际预测任务中的应用。

Method: UniCA通过协变量同质化将异构协变量转化为同质序列表示，并通过统一的注意力融合机制进行整合。

Result: 在多个单模态和多模态协变量预测基准测试中，UniCA表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: UniCA为协变量感知的时间序列预测提供了通用解决方案，同时保持了TSFMs的泛化能力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: 探索Transformer与GNNs之间的数学联系，以理解Transformer在高效硬件实现上的优势。

Method: 将Transformer的自注意力机制解释为GNNs中的消息传递，并分析其硬件效率。

Result: Transformer是一种高效的集合处理网络，能够在现代硬件上实现比稀疏消息传递更快的计算。

Conclusion: Transformer因其硬件友好的密集矩阵操作，成为当前硬件条件下更高效的GNNs实现方式。

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种神经方法解决多目标多图路由问题，验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多图环境下的多目标路由问题具有实际意义，但现有研究较少。

Method: 第一种方法直接在多图上自回归选择边；第二种方法先剪枝为简单图再构建路径。

Result: 两种模型在TSP和CVRP等问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多目标多图路由中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GPAS的技术，用于解决Pre-LN Transformer中激活方差指数增长的问题，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformer在预训练中稳定且可扩展，但存在激活方差指数增长的问题，导致残差路径主导子层输出，限制了深层学习能力。

Method: 提出GPAS技术，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，避免梯度消失问题。

Result: 在71M到1B不同规模的模型中，GPAS均取得一致性能提升，且适用于其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种简单有效的技术，能改善Pre-LN Transformer及其他架构的训练动态，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

Motivation: 探索LLM和代理系统在药物发现中的模块化潜力，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 比较不同LLM和代理类型（工具调用与代码生成）的性能，使用LLM-as-a-judge评分评估。

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet等模型表现更优，代码生成代理通常更有效，但结果因问题和模型而异。

Conclusion: 强调进一步研究代理系统模块化的必要性，以实现稳定且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Projected Compression”的模型压缩技术，通过投影模块减少模型权重，同时保持原始参数访问，最终生成一个更小的标准Transformer模型。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型规模的增加导致推理时间和计算需求上升，因此需要研究模型压缩方法以减少这些问题。

Method: 训练额外的可训练投影权重，保留原始模型参数，并将投影合并为低维矩阵，生成更小的Transformer模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高质量模型上优于硬剪枝和再训练方法，且性能随token数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: Projected Compression是一种有效的模型压缩方法，计算开销与基础模型相同，性能优于其他方法。

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Result: 实验表明EFRame提高了训练效率和鲁棒性，解锁了GRPO无法达到的深层推理能力。

Conclusion: EFRame不仅优化了GRPO，还为训练样本的分类和分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

TL;DR: CoATA是一种双通道GNN框架，通过联合增强拓扑和属性，解决了现有方法忽略两者深层交互的问题，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图中的噪声和不完整性严重影响了GNN的性能，现有方法仅关注单维增强（拓扑或属性），忽略了二者的深层交互。

Method: CoATA通过结构信号传播增强节点属性，构建节点-属性二部图优化结构，并引入对比学习进行相互校正。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验表明，CoATA优于十一种现有方法。

Conclusion: CoATA有效捕捉了拓扑与属性间的协同关系，显著提升了GNN的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

Conclusion: 本文为推理时扩展提供了理论基础和实用解决方案，优化了LLM在复杂推理中的高效部署。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Motivation: 解决GES算法在计算成本和有限样本准确性方面的不足。

Result: LGES在速度和准确性上优于GES，且对错误假设具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LGES是一种高效且稳健的因果发现算法，适用于观测和干预数据。

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出Sheaf-DMFL框架，利用层理论解决多模态数据在联邦学习中的协作问题，并通过Sheaf-DMFL-Att算法进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习算法在处理多模态数据和异构设备时存在局限性，无法充分利用多模态信息。

Method: 采用层理论构建客户端任务层间的内在关联，结合注意力机制优化多模态相关性。

Result: 在真实场景中验证了算法的优越性，特别是在异构无线通信系统中。

Conclusion: Sheaf-DMFL框架及其增强版在多模态协作学习中表现出色，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式神经架构（DNA），在视觉和语言领域进行了训练，展示了其在计算效率和参数共享方面的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过分布式架构和动态路由机制提升模型的灵活性和效率，同时保持与密集基线的竞争力。

Method: 使用包含多种模块（如Transformer、MLP、注意力等）和路由器的原型架构，通过端到端训练学习计算和通信模式。

Result: DNA在性能上与密集基线相当，并能学习计算效率和参数共享；路径分布符合幂律，模块组表现出专业化。

Conclusion: DNA展示了动态计算分配和参数共享的潜力，路径和模块专业化提供了可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多视图对比学习的新框架，用于医学时间序列的跨领域适应，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学时间序列的复杂时间依赖性和动态分布变化使得跨领域适应具有挑战性，现有方法难以充分捕捉时间动态。

Method: 使用多视图对比学习整合时间模式、导数动态和频域特征，通过独立编码器和分层融合机制学习特征不变表示。

Result: 在EEG、ECG和EMG等多样医学数据集上的实验表明，该方法在迁移学习任务中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为在多样化医疗场景中部署可靠AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different
domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic
distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature
representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal
dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a
novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate
temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features.
Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to
learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains
while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical
datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and
electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the
robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework
offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse
healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLoVE是一种用于聚类联邦学习（CFL）的新算法，通过利用客户损失向量嵌入来识别客户聚类，无需最优模型初始化，适用于监督和无监督任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CFL中，客户基于数据分布自然分组，但聚类识别具有挑战性，因为客户分配未知。CLoVE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CLoVE利用客户数据上的模型损失生成嵌入，通过相似损失模式识别聚类，并通过联邦聚合优化聚类特定模型。

Result: 理论证明CLoVE能高概率准确恢复聚类，并在线性设置中指数级快速收敛。实验表明其在少量训练轮次内实现高精度聚类恢复和最优模型性能。

Conclusion: CLoVE在CFL和个性化联邦学习任务中表现出色，具有简单性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

TL;DR: 提出FrankenBot框架，利用VLM实现多功能集成的机器人认知架构，提高操作效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有机器人系统功能单一、缺乏统一认知架构的问题，追求人类水平的操作效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用分治策略和人脑架构，将任务规划、策略生成等功能映射到不同脑区，设计高效协调机制。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中验证了异常处理、长期记忆和操作效率的显著优势，无需微调或再训练。

Conclusion: FrankenBot框架成功实现多功能集成与高效操作，为复杂环境下的机器人系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide
range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments
has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving
human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to
integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy
generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving
high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,
exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning
capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a
single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without
integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a
divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose
FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that
achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our
framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions
from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional
completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy
generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,
cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and
design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted
comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic
environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in
anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and
stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics
Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial
autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is
software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++
expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark
contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled
modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework
designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that
allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using
state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)
while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.
A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked
publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure
real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,
SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with
native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from
manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless
hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of
mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices
under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates
research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

Result: 系统AWD为0.7秒，偏差检测准确率达98.6%，显著提升着陆可靠性。

Conclusion: AeroLite-MDNet系统有效解决无人机着陆偏差问题，代码和数据公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Result: 提出的方法在性能上显著优于现有文献中的方法。

Conclusion: 结构化学习方法为滑移转向车辆的视觉导航提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其在动态操作中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to
support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization
in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle
the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.
Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models
(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in
indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We
refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold
fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our
Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates
adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.
Our experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and
flexible adaptation to dynamic indoor conditions.

computes intermediate waypoints from the geometry of the current DLO state and
the desired next state. The system decouples visual reasoning from control. In

TL;DR: LLM2Rec是一种新颖的嵌入模型，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）的语义理解与协同过滤信号，提升序列推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ID嵌入方法缺乏泛化能力，而基于文本的推荐方法又无法捕捉协同过滤信号，因此需要一种能结合两者的模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）协同监督微调，使LLMs能推断物品关系；2）物品级嵌入建模，生成兼具语义和协同信息的嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，LLM2Rec在域内和域外推荐中均显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM2Rec展示了利用LLMs构建更鲁棒、泛化能力强的嵌入模型的潜力。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by
modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of
similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely
on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order
co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past
interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based
recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual
descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode
CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for
effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should
seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve
both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for
sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs
with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1)
Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item
relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding
Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding
models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively
improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain
settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more
robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes
are available at https://github.com/HappyPointer/LLM2Rec.

TL;DR: 论文指出评估基准特征可能扭曲检索模型中领域适应的真实效果，导致误导性评估。通过环境监管文档检索案例，研究发现不同语义结构的基准对领域适应效果的评估差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示评估基准的选择如何影响领域适应效果的评估，特别是在专业领域中，以避免误导部署决策。

Method: 使用ColBERTv2模型在环境监管文档（EIS）上进行微调，并在两个语义结构不同的基准上评估性能。

Result: 一个基准显示领域适应效果微小（0.61% NDCG增益），而另一个基准显示显著提升（2.22% NDCG增益），差异达3.6倍。

Conclusion: 评估基准的语义结构（如主题多样性和边界重叠）显著影响领域适应效果的评估，需选择更贴近实际复杂性的基准。

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain
adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that
influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two
benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity,
boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits
of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case
study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)
from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with
different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain
adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on
evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic
boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG
gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures,
the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a
3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks
through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark
shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower
silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance
difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly
determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized
domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly
underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic
boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory
document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing
and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple
topics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest
(POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two
categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models.
Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver
lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a
fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit
supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact
ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so
there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework
for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that
enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one
ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to
establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is
paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to
measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs
such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise
document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships
between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals
that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25%
caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines
while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments
of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on
trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration
for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by
providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in
multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

<details>

Motivation: 解决推荐系统中用户相关性与内容多样性之间的平衡问题，以应对内容同质化和用户参与度下降的挑战。

Method: 采用多目标上下文顺序采样策略，结合贝叶斯更新动态调整评分，整合多种多样性指标（如对数行列式体积和岭杠杆分数）和多样性增益不确定性项。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了多样性，同时保持了用户相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模推荐场景中具有提升用户体验的潜力。

Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in
recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about
content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential
sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that
dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation
integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a
tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity
gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both
intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and
minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies
Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each
iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach
significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating
its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的排序基础模型IRanker，通过强化学习和迭代解码解决排序任务缺乏明确标签的问题，并在多个数据集上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排序任务广泛存在，但缺乏统一模型，且缺乏明确监督标签，开发排序基础模型面临挑战。

Method: 提出IRanker框架，利用强化学习和迭代解码逐步消除候选池中最差选项，减少输出组合空间。

Result: IRanker-3B在多个数据集上表现优异，甚至超越更大模型，同时在零样本任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: IRanker通过强化学习和迭代解码有效解决了排序任务挑战，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as
recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify
these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the
need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,
unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear
labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To
overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with
reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose
the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the
worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly
reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context
length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate
an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,
routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B
achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of
similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain
datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the
robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we
conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization
experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on
in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.
Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the
base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the
thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance
zero-shot LLM performance.

Motivation: 解决ColPali等多向量文档检索系统因高维嵌入和延迟交互评分带来的存储和计算成本问题。

Method: 结合K-Means量化、注意力引导动态剪枝和可选二进制编码三种技术，压缩嵌入并减少计算。

Result: 在ViDoRe和SEC-Filings数据集上，查询延迟降低30-50%，检索精度保持高位；在法律摘要任务中，幻觉率降低30%，延迟减半。

Conclusion: HPC-ColPali是一种高效且可扩展的多向量文档检索解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in
fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and
computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings
and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose
HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less
than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices
into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming
distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and
efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在语义对齐和视觉一致性上的不足，提出一种结合上下文设计范例的自动化布局生成方案。

Method: 通过多模态检索获取布局示例，利用LLM推荐布局，视觉语言评分代理评估并提供反馈迭代优化。

Result: 在PKU PosterLayout数据集上表现优异，显著优于基线方法LayoutPrompter。

Conclusion: 检索增强与代理多步推理结合，为自动化布局生成提供了可扩展、可解释且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖静态检索，无法捕捉动态推荐场景中的用户偏好。

Method: ARAG引入四种LLM智能体：用户理解、自然语言推理、上下文总结和项目排序。

Result: 在三个数据集上，ARAG在NDCG@5和Hit@5上分别提升42.1%和35.5%。

Conclusion: ARAG展示了智能体推理在检索增强推荐中的有效性，为LLM个性化提供新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

Motivation: 尽管混合检索方法在性能上有显著提升，但其在中文检索中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: HyReC结合了术语的语义联合表示模型、全局-局部感知编码器（GLAE）和归一化模块（NM）。

Result: 在C-MTEB检索基准上验证了HyReC的有效性。

Conclusion: HyReC为中文混合检索提供了一种高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based
retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to
performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the
application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has
remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an
innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for
hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 手动评估科学想法的创新性耗时且主观，难以规模化。因此，需要一种自动化的方法来高效、客观地评估创新性。

Method: 采用两阶段的检索增强生成框架：首先通过关键词和片段检索收集相关论文，然后通过嵌入过滤和基于方面的LLM重排序优化结果。结合专家标注数据指导系统进行创新性评估和文献推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法的评估一致性比现有方法高约13%，且基于方面的重排序对识别相关文献至关重要。

Conclusion: Idea Novelty Checker提供了一种高效、客观的创新性评估方法，为自动化科学想法生成系统提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Automated scientific idea generation systems have made remarkable progress,
yet the automatic evaluation of idea novelty remains a critical and
underexplored challenge. Manual evaluation of novelty through literature review
is labor-intensive, prone to error due to subjectivity, and impractical at
scale. To address these issues, we propose the Idea Novelty Checker, an
LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a
two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach. The Idea Novelty Checker first
collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based
retrieval, then refines this collection through embedding-based filtering
followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples
to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in
generating literature-grounded reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that our novelty checker achieves approximately 13% higher agreement than
existing approaches. Ablation studies further showcases the importance of the
facet-based re-ranker in identifying the most relevant literature for novelty
evaluation.

Motivation: 解决NLP和IR系统中存在的性别偏见问题，现有指标在检测细微偏见时存在局限。

Method: 利用LLM检测性别偏见，提出新指标CWEx，并在MS MARCO数据集上标注并发布新数据集MSMGenderBias。

Result: CWEx比现有指标更详细评估公平性，与人工标注一致性更高（Cohen's Kappa分别为58.77%和18.51%）。

Conclusion: 结合LLM、新指标和标注数据集，为IR系统偏见分析提供了更鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

Result: 模型能够生成低误差的超表面，并在30分钟内设计出均匀强度分束器和偏振分束器。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的超表面设计提供了高效工具，并公开了代码和数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

Result: 成功从SPAD二进制图像重建3D场景，解决了噪声与模糊的权衡问题，并贡献了PhotonScenes数据集。

Conclusion: PhotonSplat为运动模糊场景下的3D重建提供了有效解决方案，并支持多种下游应用。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes
from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking
systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for
volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including
accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over
long sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024
Challenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless
3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the
first time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge
attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid
dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic
approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,
attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving
benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and
improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了IHI重建中的关键挑战，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法仅依赖RGB数据，缺乏材料属性信息，限制了在机器人、AR等领域的应用。

Method: 通过建模光谱反射的漫反射和镜面反射成分，利用全局端元字典和点级丰度分布，实现材料分割和场景编辑。

Result: 实验表明，UnMix-NeRF在光谱重建和材料分割上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF为材料感知提供了新思路，支持灵活的场景编辑。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

*Tianyu Zhang,Xin Luo,Li Li,Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StableCodec提出了一种一步扩散方法，用于超低比特率图像压缩，结合高效编码和双分支结构，显著提升了重建质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散压缩方法在超低比特率下需要多步去噪和像素级一致性不足的问题。

Method: 采用高效深度压缩潜在编解码器和双分支编码结构，结合端到端优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，比特率低至0.005 bpp，且推理速度快。

Conclusion: StableCodec在超低比特率下实现了高保真和高真实感压缩，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NEED的噪声启发扩散模型，用于低剂量CT重建，通过双域重建和噪声特性匹配，显著提升了泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT重建模型的泛化性对未见剂量数据的适应性至关重要，但现有方法依赖配对数据或扩散模型存在噪声分布不匹配问题。

Method: 提出基于噪声特性的双域扩散模型：1) 投影数据去噪的移位泊松扩散模型；2) 利用LDCT图像和初始重建的双重引导扩散模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NEED在重建和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEED仅需正常剂量数据训练，通过时间步匹配策略可泛化至不同剂量水平，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，用于白质高信号（WMH）的分割和定位，支持单模态和多模态MRI输入，并评估了不同输入配置的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理缺失模态和整合解剖定位方面缺乏灵活性，需要更准确和鲁棒的WMH分析方法。

Method: 采用深度学习框架，评估了四种输入配置（FLAIR-only、T1-only、FLAIR和T1拼接、模态可互换设置），并引入了多任务模型联合预测病变和解剖区域掩模。

Result: 多模态输入显著提高了分割性能，但模态可互换设置以精度换取鲁棒性；多任务学习效果不如单独模型。

Conclusion: 多模态融合对WMH分析具有重要价值，联合建模在集成预测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分三阶段的CVD分类方法，通过分割、配准和分类，提高了分类准确性和临床可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法直接处理原始CT数据或结合分割训练端到端分类器，临床可解释性差。

Method: 分三阶段：图像分割、图像配准和下游CVD分类，利用Atlas-ISTN框架和分割基础模型提取临床可解释特征。

Result: 在ASOCA数据集上，分类准确率达87.50%，优于直接使用原始CT图像的67.50%。

Conclusion: 分阶段方法显著提升了CVD分类的准确性和临床可解释性。

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自由形变（FFD）的4D高斯泼溅方法，用于动态CBCT重建，解决了现有方法的计算成本和运动不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态CBCT重建因呼吸运动产生伪影，现有方法如HexPlane计算成本高且缺乏空间正则化。

Method: 引入FFD空间基函数和变形感知框架，统一高斯均值位置、尺度和旋转的时变演化。

Result: 在六个CBCT数据集上验证，图像质量优于HexPlane，速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 变形感知4DGS方法高效且能补偿运动，适用于动态CBCT重建。

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

TL;DR: HazeMatching是一种新的迭代方法，用于去雾显微镜图像，平衡了数据保真度和感知真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在显微镜图像去雾中无法同时兼顾数据保真度和感知真实性的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配框架，通过条件速度场引导生成过程，无需显式退化算子。

Result: 在5个数据集上评估，HazeMatching在保真度和真实性之间取得平衡，优于7个基线方法。

Conclusion: HazeMatching是一种有效且易于应用的显微镜图像去雾方法，数据与代码将公开。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

*Xiang Dai,Kyrollos Yanny,Kristina Monakhova,Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于全局复位释放（GRR）快门模式和光学随机排列的单次高动态范围（HDR）成像方法，显著提升高光区域的恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多曝光HDR成像在动态场景中易产生运动伪影，而现有单次HDR方法在高光区域表现不佳。

Method: 利用GRR快门模式实现传感器行间不同曝光时间，结合光学随机排列技术，通过优化问题和总变分先验恢复HDR数据。

Result: 在模拟中，该方法在10%以上像素饱和时优于其他单次HDR方法，实验原型动态范围达73dB。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GRR和光学随机排列，显著提升了单次HDR成像在高光区域的性能，且易于实现。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）为贝叶斯统计选择先验分布的方法，评估了Claude、Gemini和ChatGPT在真实数据集上的表现，发现LLMs在识别正确关联方面潜力巨大，但校准先验宽度仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯统计中选择先验分布具有挑战性、资源密集且主观性强，研究旨在利用LLMs提供基于知识的先验建议。

Method: 开发了详细的提示词，要求LLMs不仅建议先验分布，还需验证和反思其选择。评估了Claude Opus、Gemini 2.5 Pro和ChatGPT-4o-mini在心脏病风险和混凝土强度数据集上的表现。

Result: LLMs能正确识别所有关联方向，但中等信息先验常过于自信。Claude和Gemini表现优于ChatGPT，尤其在弱信息先验中Claude避免了不必要的模糊。

Conclusion: LLMs在高效、客观地开发信息先验方面潜力巨大，但需解决先验宽度校准问题以避免过度自信或不足。

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

Result: 比DTW方法准确率提高20%，结合DTW后进一步提升了鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: 神经网络在MIDI与音频对齐任务中具有显著潜力，可推动该领域的技术进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归语音合成模型在处理长语音序列时存在注意力不稳定、延迟高和合成质量下降的问题，限制了实时应用的可行性。

Method: 引入动态分块自回归合成框架（DCAR），采用分块到帧的注意力机制和多令牌预测训练，动态调整令牌预测范围。

Result: DCAR在测试集上显著优于传统模型，实现了72.27%的可懂度提升和2.61倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: DCAR为下一代语音合成系统提供了高效且鲁棒的基础框架。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools -
especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a
transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are
increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and
assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining
literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and
data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand,
their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical
boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly
47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam
questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently
achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article
critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the
multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions.
Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing
staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms,
and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case
studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to
harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity
and equity.

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a
transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,
hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same
path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis
and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom
problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application
requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and
limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill
telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,
over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed
coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the
abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,
offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom
challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical
representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions
within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs
in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal
integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental
step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective
AI-driven telecom management.
