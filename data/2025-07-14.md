TL;DR: CuriosAI团队提出两种多视角技能评估方法：多任务学习框架和两阶段流程，后者表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角技能评估问题，提升熟练度估计的准确性。

Method: 1. 多任务学习框架（Sapiens-2B）联合预测熟练度和场景标签；2. 两阶段流程（零样本场景识别+VideoMAE分类器）。

Result: 多任务框架准确率43.6%，两阶段流程准确率47.8%，后者更优。

Conclusion: 场景条件建模对熟练度估计有效，两阶段方法表现更佳。

Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario
recognition with view-specific VideoMAE classifiers (47.8 % accuracy). The
superior performance of the two-stage approach demonstrates the effectiveness
of scenario-conditioned modeling for proficiency estimation.

### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合提示专家评估与自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病害识别的准确性、症状分析和治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要提高其在精准农业中的可靠性。

Method: 1. 基于提示的专家评估协议；2. 余弦一致性自投票机制，生成并选择最语义一致的诊断。

Result: 在玉米叶病害识别中，诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限环境中具有实际部署潜力，展示了AI驱动精准农业工具的可靠性。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并揭示了这些模型在生成简单二进制图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLMs和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过创建新数据集，利用gpt-4o生成文本描述作为基准，再通过文本到图像模型生成图像，最后用gpt-4o评估生成图像与基准的差异。

Result: 模型在生成简单二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。该方法通过预训练和微调激活的约束关系，无需训练即可初始化LoRA权重，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重初始化方法随机且固定秩，限制了微调的性能和收敛速度。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域转移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束关系，推导出闭式权重估计，支持可变秩初始化。

Result: CNTLoRA在图像生成、分类和理解任务中优于标准和数据驱动初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了一种更优的初始化方案，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间二型模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要进一步提升效率和准确性。

Method: HML-ELM采用两阶段框架：1）基于ELM-AE的无监督特征提取；2）基于SIT2-FELM的监督分类。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在图像分类和无人机任务中优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且准确的分类方法，适用于无人机图像分类任务。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

### [7] [PanMatch: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Models for Unified Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08400)
*Yongjian Zhang,Longguang Wang,Kunhong Li,Ye Zhang,Yun Wang,Liang Lin,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于稳健的对应匹配，通过2D位移估计框架实现多任务集成，无需特定任务架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调的问题，提出统一框架实现多任务匹配。

Method: 利用2D位移估计框架和跨领域特征提取器，结合大型视觉模型的特征，构建通用匹配模型。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，并在异常场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用匹配模型的潜力，为多任务和跨领域匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Result: 所有模型精度超过93%，其中特征降维的CNN表现最优，参数少且计算高效。

Conclusion: 轻量级AI模型适合实时高光谱影像处理，支持星载AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [9] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布、Beta分布或高斯混合噪声）时的性能表现，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小型设备上进行，验证了算法在非高斯噪声下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型在非高斯噪声下的性能表现，探索算法在非设计条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用原始算法，但将高斯噪声替换为均匀分布、Beta分布或高斯混合噪声，并在小型设备上进行实验。

Result: 验证了算法在非高斯噪声下的表现，展示了其在不同噪声类型下的适应性或局限性。

Conclusion: 算法在非高斯噪声下仍可能有效，但性能表现与噪声类型相关，进一步研究在不同场景下的表现是有意义的。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumos-1是一个基于LLM架构的自回归视频生成器，通过3D RoPE和MM-RoPE技术解决时空相关性建模问题，并提出AR-DF策略优化训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构偏离、依赖外部编码器或高延迟问题，Lumos-1旨在保留LLM架构并优化性能。

Method: 采用3D RoPE和MM-RoPE技术建模时空数据，提出AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练，性能媲美EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过轻量级架构和高效训练技术，实现了高性能的视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.

### [11] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化建筑高度估计方法，使用单张高分辨率SAR图像，通过目标检测和回归实现，并在多大陆数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率SAR图像在建筑高度估计中的应用对城市规划等具有重要意义，但现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上表现不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测和高度回归的深度学习模型，使用多大陆城市数据集进行训练和评估，采用交叉验证策略测试泛化能力。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现优异（MAE约2.20米），显著优于现有方法，但在亚洲城市因高楼和不同城市形态泛化能力有所下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习在单张SAR图像建筑高度估计中具有强大的跨城市和跨大陆泛化潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [12] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建未标定的稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合配准模块，实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐和高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于优化的3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，而前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以整合更多视图。RegGS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RegGS采用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输Mixture 2-Wasserstein距离，并设计联合配准模块整合MW2距离、光度一致性和深度几何。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐，精确的相机姿态估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的3D高斯表示，有效解决了稀疏视图重建的挑战。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设物体静态或动态主体完全可见，在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断遮挡区域，结合时间上下文增强重建一致性，无需预定义模板。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应扩散去噪平滑方法，用于验证视觉模型对抗对抗样本的预测，并适应输入。通过将引导去噪扩散模型重新解释为一系列自适应高斯差分隐私机制，证明了其端到端鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉模型对抗对抗样本的鲁棒性，同时适应输入变化。

Method: 将引导去噪扩散模型重新解释为自适应高斯差分隐私机制序列，并通过GDP隐私过滤器分析其鲁棒性。

Result: 在特定引导策略下，ImageNet上的认证准确率和标准准确率均有所提升。

Conclusion: 自适应扩散去噪平滑方法在提升模型鲁棒性和准确性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [16] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Hartley变换的HNOSeg-XS架构，用于医学图像分割，解决了CNN和Transformer在计算成本、内存占用和分辨率鲁棒性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中存在计算成本高、内存占用大以及分辨率鲁棒性不足的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，利用Fourier神经算子的零样本超分辨率特性，并用Hartley变换替代Fourier变换，提出HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在BraTS'23、KiTS'23和MVSeg'23数据集上，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种分辨率鲁棒、高效且参数极少的医学图像分割模型，优于现有CNN和Transformer方法。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用双三次贝塞尔三角形表示封闭表面，实现高分辨率预测。

Result: 在生物医学成像中，SurfDist比StarDist-3D表现更好，实例参数化更紧凑。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明了可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种便携式生物力学实验室（PBL），通过智能手机应用和算法测量生物力学数据，验证了其在临床中的可靠性和敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用。

Method: 开发了PBL系统，包括智能手机应用和生物力学模型算法，并在临床环境中验证。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且敏感，与临床结果相关。

Conclusion: 智能手机视频可作为低负担工具，提供有临床意义的生物力学数据。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CR-Net的新方法，通过结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了SAR目标检测中分辨率差异导致的域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率提升导致散射特性差异增大，传统目标检测模型的泛化能力受限，域适应技术因分辨率差异存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播问题。

Method: CR-Net包含SHFA模块（结构感知特征适应）和RSAA模块（可靠结构邻接对齐），分别用于建立目标间结构关联和增强语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中显著提升了域适应性能，并达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别性，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过统一框架和优化策略显著提升了说话头生成的性能和真实感。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得进展，但模型大且不透明限制了临床实践应用。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现有针对性的压缩，保持临床意义表征。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署提供了可能。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索，损害了可解释性和组合性，CoCo-Bot旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上的实验表明，CoCo-Bot在保持视觉质量的同时，提高了概念级可控性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Conclusion: MRAG框架有效提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力，对抗隐写分析器检测。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，改进了基于上下文学习(ICL)的医学图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于标注医学图像的稀缺性，选择最优的上下文图像-掩码对具有挑战性，且微调基础ICL模型不可行。CCV旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，模型首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，然后交换查询与上下文对角色以验证预测准确性，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，CCV优于现有方法，显著提升了ICL分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的解决方案，能够增强基于ICL的医学图像分割，推动通用医学图像分割的发展。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（如ChatGPT-4o）通过静态行车记录图像进行交通场景人类化解读的潜力，重点关注老年驾驶评估中的三项任务：交通密度评估、交叉口可视性评估和停车标志识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在验证大语言模型在需要上下文推理而非简单目标检测的任务中的表现，为老年驾驶风险评估提供支持工具。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，以人类标注为参考标准，评估模型的精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，如交叉口可视性的召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%。模型在停车标志检测中表现出高精确率（86.3%）但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，设计良好的提示可使大语言模型成为驾驶风险评估的有力工具，未来需进一步探索更大数据集和下一代模型架构的应用。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEFU的新范式，通过预训练的生成扩散模型和语义一致性无监督微调（SCUF）技术，将低光增强与视觉理解任务结合，显著提升了泛化性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将低光增强与视觉理解任务分开处理，导致泛化性和可扩展性受限。本文旨在通过GEFU范式解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的生成扩散模型优化图像，提出SCUF技术，包括光照感知图像提示和循环注意力适配器，以及语义一致性约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和下游任务（分类、检测、语义分割）中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU范式成功地将低光增强与视觉理解任务结合，显著提升了性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: ODOR数据集为艺术品对象检测和视觉文化遗产研究提供了新挑战，鼓励探索对象识别与嗅觉感知的交叉研究。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.

such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性时牺牲了姿势和布局多样性，限制了视觉叙事的表达力。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：身份传输（IT）在早期去噪步骤中以姿势感知方式转移身份特征；身份细化（IR）在后期步骤中选择显著特征细化主题细节。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面均表现出色，视觉感知和性能均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoDi框架成功实现了主题一致性与姿势多样性的平衡，为文本到图像生成提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效保留类间语义关系，显著提升了大规模图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 解决现有提示学习方法在未见类别泛化能力不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 提出MuGCP，利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，引入注意力互导模块生成视觉条件提示，并通过多提示融合机制整合不同提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态条件提示生成和融合，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

Motivation: 人类能自然识别并补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整对象。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视图中的栅格化来增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成对象重建。

Conclusion: InstaScene通过创新的学习和生成技术，显著提升了机器人对复杂场景的3D感知能力，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器虽然在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大，阻碍了实际部署。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU则从空间维度入手。

Method: RALU通过三个阶段实现加速：1）低分辨率去噪捕捉全局语义结构，2）区域自适应上采样处理易产生伪影的区域，3）全分辨率上采样细化细节。同时利用噪声时间步重调度稳定分辨率转换。

Result: 在FLUX上实现了7.0倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现了3.0倍加速，图像质量损失极小。

Conclusion: RALU是一种高效的空间维度加速方法，可与现有时间维度加速方法互补，进一步降低推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实且一致的修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的3D重建具有广泛应用前景，未来需解决精度、扩展性和动态场景等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Result: 实验证明该方法在复杂文档类型（如工程图纸）的转录任务中表现优异，首次实现了端到端模型对工程图纸的转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文档基础模型的设计提供了统一框架，尤其适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为D2Dewarp的双维度文档去扭曲模型，通过感知水平和垂直方向的变形趋势，结合坐标融合模块，显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注水平维度的文本行，忽略了垂直维度的变形趋势，导致文档去扭曲效果受限。

Method: 设计了一种基于X和Y坐标的融合模块，结合水平和垂直维度的特征，并提出了自动细粒度标注方法构建新数据集。

Result: 在公开的中英文基准测试中，定量和定性结果均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: D2Dewarp通过双维度感知和特征互补，显著提升了文档去扭曲的准确性，同时公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可微的统一模型，用于多人跟踪，无需依赖预计算的轨迹片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多人跟踪中信息传播和遮挡处理的挑战。

Method: 构建动态时空图，整合空间、上下文和时间信息，并引入场景特定信息以改善遮挡处理。

Result: 在公开基准和新数据集上达到最优性能，适应多种条件。

Conclusion: 模型和数据集将公开，以推动多人跟踪研究。

Abstract: This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people
tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying
on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that
aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless
information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling,
the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new
large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene
reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with
flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be
publicly released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出OGFR方法，通过强化知识蒸馏解决遮挡行人重识别中的多样遮挡和特征污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理训练中未见的多样遮挡场景，且易受整体图像特征污染的影响。

Method: 采用师生蒸馏架构，设计遮挡感知视觉Transformer和特征擦除净化模块，通过强化学习识别并替换低质量补丁。

Result: OGFR能有效学习鲁棒特征表示，减少遮挡干扰。

Conclusion: OGFR通过知识蒸馏和特征净化，显著提升了遮挡行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一个基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工设计的放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 利用可提示的分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，同时引入解剖位置嵌入（APE）。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提高了检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供了全局解剖上下文。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval支持最小用户提示（如单点）和多种查询方式，具有临床适应性和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则处理干扰、遮挡和对象运动，限制了性能。本文探索强化学习优化内存更新的潜力。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化SAM 2的内存更新。

Result: 在单视频代理过拟合实验中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无配对图像翻译方法无法保证语义匹配的问题，特别是在语义分割任务中，噪声像素标签会影响性能。

Method: 提出DA-KPN，通过估计像素级输入转换参数并使用多尺度判别器确保转换的逼真性。

Result: 在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中表现优于现有GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN通过语义匹配保证和逼真转换，为低数据量场景下的语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: DISC提出了一种双流范式，通过分离优化实例和场景类别，提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的粒度。

Method: 采用类查询替代体素查询，设计专用解码模块，优化类别级信息流。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到SOTA性能，单帧输入甚至优于多帧方法。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景类别，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset

2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA框架，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的持续测试时适应问题，通过贝叶斯方法实现预测一致性和动态表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时适应方法在处理时间演化分布偏移时存在缺陷，如记忆限制、熵置信度不可靠和静态表征不匹配。

Method: BayesTTA采用贝叶斯框架，增量估计类条件高斯混合分布，自适应选择协方差结构，并通过GDA进行校准推理。

Result: BayesTTA在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上表现优异，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移问题，提升了模型的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,

containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Motivation: 尽管多帧BEV特征融合能提升3D感知性能，但动态物体运动导致特征变化限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用循环结构结合BEV特征，MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，使用时序一致性损失强化对齐。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时序特征对齐和循环结构，显著提升了相机3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Motivation: 传统图像数据集构建依赖耗时且低效的手工收集和标注，而人工生成的数据在构建图像数据集时价值较低，因此需要一种自动从真实世界图像构建数据集的方法。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent提供了一种高效且高质量的方法，用于自动构建真实世界图像数据集，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI虽然分辨率高，但成本昂贵且稀缺，同时存在易感性伪影等问题。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以降低对7T扫描仪的依赖。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1W MRI与7T T1图配对），训练并验证7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR、SSIM和NMSE指标优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效合成7T质量的T1图，为临床工作流程提供了更便捷的高分辨率MRI解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: ByDeWay是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）性能增强框架，通过分层深度提示（LDP）策略提升空间推理和基础能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在空间推理和基础任务中的性能不足问题，避免模型参数修改。

Method: 利用单目深度估计将场景分层（近、中、远），生成区域特定描述，并附加到图像-问题提示中。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，多个MLLMs性能均得到提升。

Conclusion: 深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效，方法轻量且兼容黑盒模型。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on

TL;DR: MoSAiC是一个统一框架，通过联合优化多模态卫星图像的对比学习，解决了地球系统观测中的多标签对齐和语义精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中的高类间相似性和场景复杂性使得表示学习变得困难，尤其是在低标签和多标签设置下。现有对比学习框架缺乏多标签对齐和跨模态语义精度的机制。

Method: MoSAiC框架结合了模态内和模态间的对比学习，并采用多标签监督对比损失，专门针对多模态卫星图像设计。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在准确性、聚类一致性和泛化能力上均优于完全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像的表示学习提供了一种更鲁棒和语义精确的解决方案，特别适用于低标签和高类重叠场景。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关键点跟踪的无训练分割方法，用于MRI肌肉分割，性能接近CNN模型但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI肌肉分割的自动化方法存在计算成本高、依赖大数据集和分割小肌肉精度低的问题，CNN方法也有计算量大、泛化性差和可解释性不足的缺点。

Method: 结合关键点选择和Lucas-Kanade光流，提出了一种无需训练的分割方法。

Result: 平均Dice相似系数为0.6-0.7，性能与CNN模型相当，但计算需求更低，可解释性更强。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床和研究中的肌肉分割提供了一种高效、可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的新型嵌入式字幕评价指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型计算资源消耗大，需要一种轻量级替代方案，同时保持多模态对齐能力。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP模型，并设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在减少计算资源和时间的同时，保持了与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为字幕评价指标高效有效，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标混合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Motivation: 解决现有确定性注意力MIL方法在实例级不确定性量化上的不足，特别是在数字病理学中。

Method: 提出SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力得分的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以优化性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理学数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级性能上均表现优异，且训练更快。

Conclusion: SGPMIL通过不确定性量化显著提升了实例级预测的质量和可解释性，同时保持了袋级性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在局限，无法满足真实世界需求。

Method: 提出了RoundaboutHD数据集，包含40分钟4K分辨率视频，512辆车的标注数据，支持多任务分析。

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更接近真实场景的数据支持。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

TL;DR: 论文提出基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像任务中表现优于深度学习和Radiomics方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 使用基于STV特征的弱学习器集成方法，利用其多尺度纹理表征能力和低相关性。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV方法（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取预测具有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、情境感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，并已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中表现优异，广泛应用于医疗和智能制造等领域，因此高效压缩SAM成为迫切需求。

Method: 提出Birkhoff算法，采用超压缩技术将高维参数向量转为低维标量，并设计HyperLinear层加速推理。

Result: 在18个SAM模型上测试，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，例如在SAM2-B上实现5.17x压缩比，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的SAM压缩方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部件感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的多部件建模和细粒度控制能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Conclusion: CLiFT在数据大小、渲染质量和速度之间提供了灵活权衡，是一种高效的神经渲染解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Motivation: 解决表格问答任务中因表格规模大、列语义不完整和实体模糊带来的挑战。

Method: 提出TableReasoner框架，结合结构和语义表示建模表格，设计多步模式链接计划聚焦查询相关信息，并采用迭代推理架构。

Result: 在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均取得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合模式链接和迭代推理，有效提升了表格问答的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击（绕过安全机制）成为重要问题，需有效防御方法。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为序贯扩展博弈，提出“紫色代理”结合RRT进行对抗探索与防御。

Result: 紫色代理能主动模拟攻击轨迹并干预，为分析对抗动态和降低越狱风险提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM越狱防御提供了原则性方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Motivation: 研究在有限理性下，LLM如何通过提示选择影响决策，填补经典博弈论与LLM行为之间的空白。

Method: 提出LLM-Nash框架，将均衡定义在提示空间，通过LLM推理生成行为输出。

Result: 展示推理均衡与传统纳什均衡的差异，为LLM系统战略互动提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为研究有限理性、认知约束和战略互动提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Conclusion: 研究形式化了适应性探索的平衡机制，为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了新见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法能够灵活控制表达能力和可扩展性的权衡，为神经符号推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Motivation: 现有QFL框架多为单模态，无法满足现实任务中多模态的需求，且缺失模态会降低模型性能。

Method: 采用多模态QFL框架，结合量子纠缠进行中间融合，并设计MMA机制隔离未训练量子电路。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态QFL结合MMA机制显著提升了模型性能，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了一种可信且系统化的推理方法，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leanabell-Prover-V2是一个7B参数的大型语言模型，用于生成Lean 4的形式化定理证明，通过集成验证器的长链思维（CoT）和强化学习（RL）提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步优化模型性能，通过验证器反馈实现自我修正和稳定训练。

Method: 采用强化学习结合验证器反馈，包括反馈令牌掩码和简单奖励策略，优化多轮验证交互的推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了定理证明的性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的AI代理推理框架INoT，通过设计新的LLM-Read代码提示，减少推理成本并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其自然语言理解能力和高推理成本。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过LLM-Read代码提示实现程序化对话推理，减少外部迭代成本。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，性能平均提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架有效提升了AI代理的性能并显著降低了推理成本，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a

accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to

TL;DR: PUMA提出了一种层剪枝语言模型，通过模态自适应学习提升统一多模态检索的效率，同时减少资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多媒体内容增长，统一多模态检索需求增加，但现有大型多模态语言模型参数庞大，训练成本高且推理效率低。

Method: 1. 结构上采用层剪枝自蒸馏，保留浅层并蒸馏深层特征；2. 学习上引入模态自适应对比学习损失，区分模态内和模态间负样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少资源使用，同时保持强性能。

Conclusion: PUMA通过结构剪枝和模态自适应学习，高效解决了统一多模态检索问题。

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解金融影响者的多模态信号（如语气、表达方式）对股票推荐的影响，超越传统文本分析。

Method: 引入VideoConviction数据集（6000+专家标注），比较多模态大模型（MLLMs）和文本大模型（LLMs）的表现。

Result: 多模态输入提升股票代码提取，但模型难以区分投资行为和信心；反向策略（对抗推荐）年回报率超S&P 500 6.8%，但风险更高。

Conclusion: VideoConviction为多模态金融研究提供了基准，推动了多模态任务的多样化评估。

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our
code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为视觉语义解析器的新框架，通过生成视觉语义描述（VSD）来弥合图像和文本模态的差距，显著提升了图像-文本匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像和文本模态在表示上的固有差异（连续高维图像特征 vs. 离散结构化文本），以实现更好的跨模态对齐。

Method: 结合实例级对齐（融合视觉特征与VSD）和原型级对齐（通过VSD聚类），并将其无缝集成到现有ITM模型中。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MSCOCO数据集上表现显著提升，并展示了出色的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过VSD有效弥合了模态差距，提升了ITM性能，且具有跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的文本转语音模型在控制语音特征时存在灵活性和局限性的矛盾，需要一种方法同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 通过主成分分析确定输出方差的主要潜在特征，并将其作为新标签进行二次微调。

Result: 在未包含情感披露的冰岛语音模型上，该方法提高了模型的整体可控性。

Conclusion: 提出的微调方法有效解决了模型的灵活性和局限性问题，提升了控制能力。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel

Result: 越狱尝试的复杂性未显著高于正常对话，攻击毒性和复杂性稳定，防御机制在改进。复杂性分布未呈现幂律特征。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类创造力对攻击复杂性的限制，同时警告学术披露可能破坏现有平衡，引发广泛危害。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强劲，但在推理和生成任务中表现不佳，尤其在数值准确性和复杂推理上存在明显差距。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化以提升综合能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

Method: 提出三层次理解理论：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解。

Result: LLMs展现出类似理解的能力，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应转向研究LLMs独特的工作机制，而非争论其是否具备理解能力。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Conclusion: R3框架简单高效，适用于多种预训练模型，显著提升文本生成效果。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

Motivation: 了解LLMs在简历筛选任务中的表现是否稳定，以及其与人类专家的差异，为自动化招聘系统提供参考。

Method: 使用控制数据集测试三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同上下文中的表现，并与三位人类招聘专家对比。采用方差分析和配对t检验。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类评估存在显著差异。GPT对上下文适应最强，Gemini部分适应，Claude最弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释的模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎应用于自动化招聘系统。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

TL;DR: 本文全面研究了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在图像字幕任务中的应用，通过外部和内部实验分析了演示配置策略和模型行为，并提出了新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLMs）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMMs），但多模态ICL的演示配置研究尚不充分。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过外部实验（如演示配置策略）和内部实验（如注意力特性分析）研究多模态ICL，并提出新指标。

Result: 揭示了ICEs配置策略对模型性能的影响，并量化了典型LMM行为。

Conclusion: 结合外部和内部分析的方法及新指标，为理解多模态ICL提供了双重视角，并适用于更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大多数商业大语言模型（LLMs）在伦理和政治回应上表现出一致的自由主义倾向，主要归因于训练数据、强化学习、学术伦理框架和安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs政治倾向的成因及其影响，区分政治偏见与合法认知差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数，分析七种主流LLMs的政治倾向。

Result: 发现大多数模型优先考虑自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调进一步强化这一倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs的自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体理性而非偏见。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响。

Method: 随机分配37,000名申请者至传统招聘流程或AI辅助流程，比较通过率和后续就业率。

Result: AI辅助流程通过率提高20个百分点，后续就业率提高5.9个百分点，但倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI在招聘中有效，但需关注其潜在偏见和选择标准。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医疗应用中免责声明的使用情况，以确保用户安全。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛查模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%降至2025年的0.97%，2023年的19.6%降至2025年的1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力的提升，免责声明应作为安全措施，根据临床背景动态调整。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Motivation: 探讨SLMs作为隐私保护工具在敏感应用中的理解能力，并与LLMs进行对比。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本学习范式，评估5种SLMs和3种LLMs在6项心理健康任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多分类任务中性能下降相似（30%）。少样本学习显著提升SLMs性能（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，可作为隐私保护的筛查工具，尤其在少样本学习下表现突出。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs缺乏上下文信息时表现不佳或易产生幻觉，需结合外部工具提供实时数据以提高准确性。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过外部API获取额外信息，并集成计算工具（如计算器、日历）。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上测试，数学推理准确率83%，科学推理88%，显著优于GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统提供了可能，支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实用性有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型缺乏临床相关性、多模态分析不足以及评估指标与临床需求不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用、挑战和差距，以促进其更好地融入医疗实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图或多分辨率成像等关键功能，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: 尽管MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，才能实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

TL;DR: CRISP提出了一种通过微调小模型生成高质量计划的方法，显著优于少样本提示和大模型的Chain-of-Thought推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设LLMs仅通过少样本提示即可生成有效计划，但缺乏验证。CRISP旨在挑战这一假设并提供多领域的高质量计划数据集。

Method: CRISP通过自动生成和严格验证（内在和外在）高水平的数学推理和代码生成计划，并利用微调小模型生成计划。

Result: 微调小模型生成的计划质量优于大模型的少样本提示和Chain-of-Thought推理，且具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRISP展示了通过微调小模型生成高质量计划的有效性，并验证了其跨领域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Motivation: 随着语言模型代理在科研领域的应用增多，设计消融实验成为关键。AblationBench旨在评估代理在此类任务中的能力。

Method: 提出AblationBench，包含两个任务：基于方法部分提出消融实验的AuthorAblation（83个实例）和基于全文发现缺失消融实验的ReviewerAblation（350个实例）。使用语言模型作为自动评估框架。

Result: 前沿语言模型表现有限，最佳系统仅识别29%的原始消融实验。思维链提示优于现有代理方法。

Conclusion: AblationBench为评估语言模型代理在消融实验规划任务中的能力提供了基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并展示了思维链提示的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

TL;DR: Krul提出了一种动态选择KV缓存压缩策略的系统，通过预选策略、注意力相似性估计和无气泡恢复调度器，显著提升了多轮对话中LLM的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率问题，现有固定压缩策略忽略对话特异性，导致准确性下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略，引入预选策略选择器、注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: 实验显示Krul在TTFT和KV缓存存储上分别减少1.5x-2.68x和1.33x-2.35x，且不损失生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul通过动态策略和优化调度，显著提升了多轮对话中LLM的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对模型进行微调，同时适应不同规模和类型的知识图谱。

Method: 利用大语言模型策略性执行SPARQL查询，搜索相关IRI和字面量，无需微调。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零射击状态下的最佳性能，在Freebase上接近少射击方法，其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需微调的情况下，能有效生成SPARQL查询，适用于多种知识图谱和语言模型。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Conclusion: 该框架为透明、可审计地利用LMs提供了可行方案，适用于多个实际决策工作流，如医疗和法律领域，并通过公共评论处理验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、与查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，显著减少内存占用并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存内存占用高的问题，提升吞吐量并降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩方法。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中保留一半令牌，内存负担减少63%，性能与竞争方法相当。

Conclusion: Compactor高效且通用，适用于多种任务和模型家族。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从大型语言模型（LLM）到小型语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，特别关注保留共情能力，通过两步微调过程和针对性提示显著提升SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的场景（如智能手机）中，SLM需要保留LLM的共情能力以支持高质量人机交互。

Method: 采用两步微调过程，利用从LLM提取的共情对话数据集，并设计了四组针对性提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 经过优化的SLM在生成共情回应时胜率达到90%，比基础提示方法提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为资源受限场景下的高质量人机交互提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

TL;DR: TruthTorchLM是一个开源Python库，提供30多种真实性预测方法，支持多种模型和接口，旨在提升生成式大语言模型输出的真实性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式大语言模型（LLMs）常产生不真实的输出，尤其在关键场景中，准确预测其真实性至关重要。现有工具如Guardrails和LM-Polygraph功能有限，TruthTorchLM填补了这一空白。

Method: TruthTorchLM提供多样化的真实性预测方法，涵盖不同计算成本、访问级别、文档需求及监督类型。支持HuggingFace和LiteLLM，提供生成、评估、校准等统一接口。

Result: 在TriviaQA、GSM8K和FactScore-Bio数据集上评估了代表性方法，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM是一个功能全面且可扩展的工具，为真实性预测研究提供了便利。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调LLMs中的OOCR现象可通过LoRA微调添加恒定导向向量解释，导向向量能提升任务性能并引发泛化，甚至适用于条件行为任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs为何能在微调中表现出OOCR现象，以理解其安全可靠部署的关键能力。

Method: 通过LoRA微调添加恒定导向向量，并直接训练导向向量以验证OOCR现象。

Result: 导向向量能提升任务性能并引发泛化，甚至适用于条件行为任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调中OOCR现象的学习机制，为LLMs的安全可靠部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为代理学生在智能辅导系统（ITSs）和试题测试中的准确性，发现未经指导的强通用模型普遍优于学生平均水平，而弱模型或领域不匹配模型可能偶然对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能准确模拟真实学生的行为和特征，以指导其在教育领域的应用。

Method: 收集489项NAEP数据，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力对标。

Result: 强通用模型普遍优于学生平均水平，但模型和提示语的选择对对齐效果影响显著。

Conclusion: 需开发新的训练和评估策略，并提供了选择可行代理的指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Motivation: 以往研究常忽视疼痛体验中的性别差异，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用NLP和HAM-CNN模型对帖子进行性别分类（F1分数0.86），并分析语言差异。

Result: 女性帖子更情感化，偏头痛和鼻窦炎在女性中更常见，疼痛药物反应存在性别差异。

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中起重要作用，未来研究应更多关注性别因素。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中过度思考的问题，提升模型效率和可控性。

Method: 1. 构建双模式数据集；2. 使用多令牌预测增强的知识蒸馏；3. 冷启动初始化策略；4. 提出 Step-SRPO 强化学习算法。

Result: KAT 在多个基准测试中表现优异，减少 token 使用约 30%，并在实际应用中提升开发效率。

Conclusion: KAT 展示了 AutoThink 范式的可扩展性，未来 200B MoE 模型有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为同步自检（SSR）的新微调范式，用于解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在文档图像机器翻译（DIMT）任务中的遗忘问题，同时保持其OCR能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在文档图像任务（如OCR）中表现优异，但在DIMT任务中面临跨模态和跨语言的双重挑战，且传统微调方法会导致模型遗忘原有OCR能力。

Method: 引入SSR范式，通过让模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其强大的单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明，SSR学习有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，提升了MLLMs在OCR和DIMT任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能够在提升DIMT性能的同时保留模型的OCR能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一个基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，帮助电商商家生成高质量消息模板和写作指导，提升客户关系管理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商家在私域渠道（如即时通讯和电子邮件）中缺乏撰写有说服力消息的专业知识和工具，CRMAgent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CRMAgent通过三种模式运作：基于群组的学习、检索与适配、基于规则的备用方案。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，提升了客户关系管理的效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程已能生成商业化相关创意，但某些领域需更深入的专业知识。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Motivation: 需要明确对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练跨编码器重排器时的实际效果差异。

Method: 通过在同一数据上训练不同大小和架构的重排器，并使用强对比学习模型作为教师进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 知识蒸馏在大模型教师下表现优于对比学习，但教师模型容量相同时无优势。

Conclusion: 建议在有强大教师模型时使用知识蒸馏，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Motivation: 系统探索如何充分释放LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的性能。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，常规方法对其提升有限；多语言对齐方法通过延长推理长度提升LLMs多语言性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Motivation: 尽管n-gram指标在英语中被认为与人工评估相关，但其在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了一个跨八种语言（来自四种类型学家族）的大规模评估套件，分析指标与人工评估的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中与人工评估相关性较低，而神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。适当的标记化可缓解形态丰富语言的问题。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中存在局限性，建议加大对神经指标的投资。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Motivation: 语言模型容易产生事实错误的幻觉，而微调高质量事实数据可能减少幻觉，但获取黄金数据成本高且可能引发更多幻觉。

Method: 研究微调数据的事实性与长文本生成任务中幻觉的关系，比较黄金数据和模型生成数据的效果，并评估过滤策略。

Result: 微调模型自认为可信的生成数据比黄金数据更有效，且通过模型内部判断过滤的数据效果最佳。

Conclusion: 模型自身的信念可以作为事实性的有力信号，这一发现在多个领域均适用。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource
for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the
context of interdisciplinary studies.

*Zilu Dong,Xiangqing Shen,Zinong Yang,Rui Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChainEdit框架结合知识图谱逻辑规则与LLM推理能力，系统性更新知识，提升逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在关联事实传播中难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: 通过知识图谱提取逻辑规则，与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联知识簇。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现了新的SOTA性能，确保内部逻辑一致性。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策会议是解决复杂问题的重要方式，但传统方法依赖人工协调。LLM在模拟多智能体交互方面表现出潜力，因此探索其在决策会议模拟中的应用。

Method: 设计了一个LLM多智能体系统，评估六种LLM在立场检测和立场极性检测任务中的表现，并将其应用于模拟决策会议中的共识检测。

Result: LLM能可靠检测动态辩论中的共识，引入共识检测智能体可提升辩论效率和决策质量。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能有效模拟群体决策过程，支持跨领域的专家决策工作坊。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

*Marina Luketina,Andrea Benkel,Christoph G. Schuetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在奥地利和欧盟增值税法律框架下辅助法律决策的能力，实验表明LLMs可支持税务顾问自动化常规任务，但需进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务咨询中客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLMs有望减轻税务专业人员负担，但其幻觉倾向是挑战。

Method: 通过微调和检索增强生成（RAG）方法，在教科书案例和实际案例中测试LLMs性能。

Result: LLMs能有效支持增值税任务并提供法律依据，但处理隐性客户知识和特定文档仍有局限。

Conclusion: LLMs在税务领域有潜力，但需整合结构化背景信息以实现更广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025

Conclusion: 该研究为教育类文章连贯性的自动评分提供了一种潜在改进方法。

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Conclusion: clembench为模型评估提供了灵活、可控的新方法，有望推动对话游戏评估的广泛应用。

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能提升LDA在文档主题建模中的表现，特别是在初始化和后校正两个关键阶段。

Method: 通过LLM引导的主题聚类初始化Gibbs采样算法，并应用LLM进行后校正。

Result: LLM初始化仅改善早期迭代，不影响收敛；LLM后校正显著提升连贯性5.86%。

Conclusion: LLM在主题建模中并非总是最优，但其后校正功能具有实际价值。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Conclusion: ASR生成的错误转录在说话人归属任务中表现优于或至少不逊于人工转录，可能因转录错误揭示了说话人特有特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Result: 在MiniF2F数据集上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: KELPS框架在形式化数学方面表现出色，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参数更新的动态知识图谱增强框架（KGA），通过内外聚合路径实现实时知识融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数微调导致的灾难性遗忘和实时知识更新受限问题。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导的注意力模块（KGA），包含外向聚合（动态融合外部知识）和内向聚合（过滤无关信号）。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架实现了无需参数更新的实时知识融合，提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

TL;DR: MM-Coder是一个多语言多模态软件开发者，通过整合UML图和流程图等视觉设计输入与文本指令，提升代码生成的准确性和架构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）多为纯文本模型，忽略了软件开发中常用的视觉辅助工具（如UML图和流程图），导致代码生成与实际需求脱节。

Method: 开发了MM-Coder，结合视觉设计输入（Visual Workflow）和文本指令，并构建了MMc-Instruct数据集进行多模态指令调优。

Result: 通过新基准MMEval评估，发现模型在视觉信息捕捉、指令遵循和高级编程知识方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder旨在通过多模态输入（文本和视觉设计）推动工业编程的革命。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法“缓存引导”，通过一次性干预键值缓存来隐式引导语言模型，无需微调或修改提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有激活引导技术需要持续干预的问题，提供更稳定、高效且易于集成的解决方案。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成推理轨迹构建引导向量，直接干预键值缓存，诱导小语言模型进行多步推理。

Result: 实验表明，缓存引导改善了推理结构和任务性能，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 缓存引导是一种更稳健、实用的控制生成方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

### [151] [Human vs. LLM-Based Thematic Analysis for Digital Mental Health Research: Proof-of-Concept Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08002)

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LLM-based thematic analysis is cost-effective but lacks depth compared to human analysis, though it shows promise for large-scale mental health studies when combined with human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the effectiveness of LLM-based thematic analysis (using GPT-4o and RISEN framework) with traditional human analysis in mental health interviews, addressing the resource limitations of human coding.

Method: Used GPT-4o with RISEN prompt engineering to analyze transcripts from a stress-reduction trial, comparing it to human analysis in Dedoose. Metrics included code development, saturation points, and theme synthesis.

Result: LLMs matched human performance in deductive coding and saturation but lagged in inductive coding and theme depth. Knowledge-based LLMs reached saturation faster.

Conclusion: LLMs are a viable, cost-effective tool for thematic analysis in mental health research but require human oversight for depth and nuance.

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

TL;DR: SSSUMO是一种半监督深度学习方法，用于子运动分解，实现了最先进的精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建精度、计算成本和验证方面存在困难，主要由于难以获得手工标记数据。

Method: 采用半监督学习框架，从基于最小抖动原理生成的合成数据中学习，并通过适应未标记的人类运动数据迭代优化。

Result: 模型在合成和多样化人类运动数据集上显著优于现有方法，并在高噪声条件下表现出鲁棒性，且实时运行（每输入秒不到一毫秒）。

Conclusion: SSSUMO在精度和速度上的提升为人机交互、康复医学和运动控制研究开辟了新应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

Conclusion: AIRS是一个模块化、可扩展的康复框架，适用于更广泛的康复场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS)
framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home
rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,
including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for
machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is
demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement
(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A
smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual
and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted
to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for
further use and customization.

Motivation: 手动创建原型人物角色耗时、费力且易受偏见影响，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用生成式AI和提示工程技术，通过案例研究（19名参与者）评估方法的效率、效果和用户接受度。

Result: 方法显著减少了时间和精力，提升了人物角色的质量和可重用性，但存在泛化和领域特异性问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效整合到产品发现中，但需解决泛化和情感共鸣的挑战。

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such
as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.
However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,
cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and
empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate
proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to
evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,
and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study
with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative
and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency
by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of
personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially
regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations
related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although
cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy
varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel
empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software
Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be
addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

TL;DR: DHDA是一个在线配置性能学习框架，旨在动态适应全局和局部概念漂移，通过双重层次化调整实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代可配置软件系统在动态环境中运行时，工作负载变化、硬件更新等因素会导致概念漂移，现有离线或迁移学习方法难以实时适应。

Method: DHDA采用双重层次化调整：上层通过重新划分数据并局部重训练处理全局漂移；下层局部模型异步检测和适应局部漂移，结合增量更新和定期全训练以平衡效率。

Result: 在八个软件系统上的评估表明，DHDA显著提升了准确性，适应漂移能力提高2倍，同时保持合理开销。

Conclusion: DHDA能有效应对动态环境中的概念漂移，为配置性能学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate
configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic
environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates
will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,
which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and
local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,
existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to
these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration
performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online
configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to
these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the
local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper
level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the
local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the
lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and
adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA
combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize
redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight
software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA
achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with
up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to
improve different local models in handling concept drift.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在资源受限的边缘设备上的广泛应用，保护知识产权免受恶意用户窃取的威胁变得尤为重要。

Method: 为每个用户生成唯一密钥，通过模型不变性构建线性约束来推导稳定的水印值，并利用噪声机制隐藏水印位置以抵御合谋攻击。

Result: 在Llama3、Phi3和Gemma三种流行模型上的实验表明，该方案对多种攻击方法（如微调、剪枝、量化等）具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该水印方案能有效保护大型语言模型的知识产权，且无需额外的训练或微调。

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the
increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with
the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions
resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft
by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without
retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique
key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear
constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology
utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios
against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular
models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong
robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning,
quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的编辑方法因忽视整体几何结构，导致编辑结果出现伪影或不稳定。

Method: FlowDrag通过构建3D网格并使用能量函数指导变形，将网格位移投影到2D并结合UNet去噪过程，实现精确编辑。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD和DragBench基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过结合几何信息和用户定义点，实现了更准确和一致的编辑效果。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在相机-物体关系（如物体方向、相机视角和镜头）识别上表现不佳，原因是训练数据缺乏多样性。

Method: 利用3D资产、渲染和扩散模型生成逼真图像，结合大语言模型（LLMs）生成文本提示，创建了Ultimate3D数据集（240K VQAs）。

Result: 在相机-物体关系识别任务上，基于该数据集微调的MLLMs比商业模型平均准确率提升33.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和框架为MLLMs的广泛应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

TL;DR: AmpLyze是一种预测抗菌肽（AMP）溶血毒性（HC50）的模型，通过序列预测实际HC50值并解释毒性驱动残基，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅能判断抗菌肽的毒性或非毒性，无法定量预测HC50值，AmpLyze填补了这一空白。

Method: AmpLyze结合残基级ProtT5/ESM2嵌入和序列级描述符，通过双分支结构和交叉注意力模块训练，使用log-cosh损失函数提高鲁棒性。

Result: AmpLyze的PCC为0.756，MSE为0.987，优于经典回归器和现有技术。交叉注意力模块进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: AmpLyze将溶血评估转化为定量、基于序列且可解释的预测，为AMP设计和早期毒性筛选提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for
antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic"
or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value
from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model
couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in
dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained
with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model
reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors
and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,
and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.
Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest
safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,
sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design
and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.

*Berire Gunes Reyhan,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化理论的安全深度强化学习框架，用于超可靠无线网络控制系统，首次在文献中确保约束满足的同时优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络控制系统中控制和通信系统高度相互依赖，需要协同设计。

Method: 框架分为两阶段：优化理论阶段推导最优条件，安全深度强化学习阶段采用教师-学生框架指导代理。

Result: 仿真表明该框架优于基于规则和其他优化理论的基准，收敛更快、奖励更高、稳定性更强。

Conclusion: 该框架为超可靠无线网络控制系统提供了一种有效的协同设计和优化方法。

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication
systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper
presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction
while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The
approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age
of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability
in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely
derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and
maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The
framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first
stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships
among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage
employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent
(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system
constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other
optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher
rewards, and greater stability.

TL;DR: FreeAudio提出了一种无需训练的时间控制文本到音频生成框架，支持长音频生成，通过LLM规划时间窗口和注意力控制技术实现精确时间控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2A方法因音频-文本对齐数据有限，难以处理复杂时间控制提示，需改进合成质量。

Method: 使用LLM规划非重叠时间窗口并重新描述文本，结合解耦聚合注意力控制和上下文潜在组合技术。

Result: FreeAudio在无需训练方法中达到最佳时间控制T2A合成质量，与训练方法相当，支持长音频生成。

Conclusion: FreeAudio为时间控制长音频合成开辟了新途径，性能接近领先训练方法。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent
advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and
quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle
to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,
"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation
techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable
timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is
still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled
T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled
long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping
at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time
windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based
on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and
Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent
Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.
Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art
timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is
comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates
comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and
paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are

Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large
audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech,
sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder
trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3
modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking,
allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering;
(iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning
(including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To
enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets
curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL,
AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based
training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new
SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks,
surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger

Method: 利用UNESCO的广播录音数据集，测试Whisper等LID系统和SR方法的性能。

Result: LID系统能有效处理第二语言和口音语音，但说话人嵌入易受信道、年龄和语言偏见影响。

Conclusion: SR方法在档案库应用中需克服说话人嵌入的偏见问题。

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频修复方法在缺失段超过100毫秒时质量下降，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 使用预训练的音频标记器生成离散表示，并在离散潜在空间中建模生成过程。

Result: 在MusicNet和MTG数据集上，尤其在长缺失段（300-500毫秒）中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为音频修复提供了一种稳定且语义连贯的解决方案，尤其适用于长缺失段。

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in
corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and
spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps,
they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this
work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion
modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a
pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process
directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically
coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the
MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap
durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset,
extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing
baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for
restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method

TL;DR: MIDI-VALLE是一种基于VALLE框架的神经编解码语言模型，用于从音乐乐谱生成富有表现力的音频表演，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音乐表演合成模型在多样化的MIDI来源、音乐风格和录音环境中泛化能力不足。

Method: 改进VALLE框架，通过参考音频表演及其对应MIDI进行条件化，将MIDI和音频编码为离散标记。

Result: 在ATEPP和Maestro数据集上，Frechet Audio Distance降低75%以上，听众测试中表现显著优于基线。

Conclusion: MIDI-VALLE在音频合成质量和泛化能力上取得显著提升，适用于多样化MIDI输入。

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to
capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music
performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating
expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into
audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across
diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address
these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted
from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot
personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio
synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio
performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that
rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,
facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.
Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an
extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that
MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving
over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the
listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline,
demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse
performance MIDI inputs.

Motivation: 利用MS MARCO数据集的大规模人工标注数据，研究深度学习方法在文档和段落排序任务中的表现，并探索数据更新对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用深度神经排序模型，结合大规模预训练，对比单阶段和多阶段检索方法。

Result: 深度神经排序模型继续优于传统方法，单阶段检索表现良好但不及多阶段检索。数据更新引发标注完整性和质量的新问题。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在排序任务中表现优越，但数据更新带来的挑战需进一步研究。

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

TL;DR: CUE-RAG提出了一种新的检索增强生成方法，通过多粒度图索引、混合提取策略和查询驱动的迭代检索，显著提升了问答性能并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在问答任务中表现优异，但其性能受限于领域特定和最新知识的缺乏。现有的基于图的检索增强生成方法因图质量差和查询信息利用不足而受限。

Method: CUE-RAG引入多粒度图索引（文本块、知识单元和实体）、混合提取策略以减少LLM标记使用，以及查询驱动的迭代检索策略（Q-Iter）。

Result: 在三个问答基准测试中，CUE-RAG显著优于现有方法，准确率和F1分数分别提升99.33%和113.51%，同时索引成本降低72.58%。

Conclusion: CUE-RAG在提升基于图的检索增强生成系统性能和成本效率方面表现出色，甚至在不使用LLM索引时也能匹配或超越基线方法。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of
domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from
graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from
poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of
query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index
incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic
content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy
that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated
knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy
that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph
traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy
and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.
Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM
for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency
of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练的2D基础模型，但缺乏3D空间信息和对多视角的泛化能力，限制了在精细机器人操作中的效果。

Method: CL3R采用点云掩码自编码器学习3D表示，并通过对比学习结合预训练2D模型的语义知识，同时提出多视角点云随机融合以提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明CL3R在仿真和现实世界中均表现出色，显著提升了机器人操作策略的感知能力。

Conclusion: CL3R通过统一的3D表示和语义知识迁移，有效解决了机器人操作中的感知挑战。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统PD控制器和现有DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）在实时适应性和容错性方面表现不足。

Method: 提出TD3-HD方法，结合Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient（TD3）、Hindsight Experience Replay（HER）和Dimension Wise Clipping（DWC），以增强稀疏奖励环境下的学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于PD控制器和其他DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大的、容错的机载AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

Motivation: 解决从真实图像数据学习机器人操作策略时的高成本问题，避免模拟与真实环境的视觉域差距。

Method: 使用稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建人类-机器人交接场景，生成图像-动作对，训练机器人策略。

Result: 在16种家用物体上训练的策略可直接部署到真实环境，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的高效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Motivation: 当前6G网络中的智能任务需要独立的知识检索流程，导致数据冗余和解释不一致。

Method: 提出KP-A，将网络知识获取与管理与智能逻辑解耦，提供统一的知识接口。

Result: KP-A在实时网络知识问答和边缘AI服务编排中表现良好，并开源了实现。

Conclusion: KP-A简化了开发，提升了互操作性，支持未来标准化。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling
autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including
self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current
implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge
retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent
interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN
(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified
Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.
By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence
logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for
intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge
interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence
agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live
network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation
artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future
standardization efforts.

Motivation: 6G需要从设计之初就集成AI以应对复杂性和支持广泛的AI应用，而5G中AI仅为附加功能。

Method: 基于从2G到5G的网络运营和标准化经验，研究了AI-Native RAN的框架及其三大核心能力，并提出了标准化建议。

Result: 通过大规模5G-A基站试验验证，提出的架构显著降低了平均空口延迟、提升了根因识别能力并优化了网络能耗。

Conclusion: 本文为6G AI-Native RAN的标准化设计提供了Day 1框架，平衡了技术创新与实际部署。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain
and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not
natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G
shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support
ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and
standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and
standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,
with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and
capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its
three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization
direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable
AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The
standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including
an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale
field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered
significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause
identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture
and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework
for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation
with practical deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks,
in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal.
While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in
finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead
on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an
agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential
equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which
inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional
backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally
plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading
strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across
multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model
discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading
decisions.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing
population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that
focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context
are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning
about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at
home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information
that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological
observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models,
personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context.
We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties
encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each
property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a
counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate
the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants,
highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults
ageing in place.

Result: 实验表明，QuPTs具有高度隐蔽性，显著降低了QNN的性能，最高导致准确率下降23%。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对纯量子神经网络的特洛伊攻击研究，填补了相关领域的空白。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of
quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the
quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed
Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum
gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop
Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly
stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically
QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the
compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network
independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.

Conclusion: 意识可能是通过长程关联连接知识组分的阻塞相，神经语言模型的临界缩放行为可通过阻塞物理解释。

Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the
emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in
high-dimensional disordered systems.By establishing analogies with jamming
transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three
fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks:
temperature, volume fraction, and stress.The theory provides a unified physical
explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence,
demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise
reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where
generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles
that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence
of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures
including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains
neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting
consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge
components via long-range correlations.

Conclusion: xpSHACL有效解决了传统SHACL验证报告难以理解的问题，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF
data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users
need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and
consistency.

Motivation: 传统森林资源调查方法耗时耗力，多光谱LiDAR技术可提供高效、非破坏性的解决方案。

Method: 使用HeliALS系统获取高密度多光谱点云数据，并测试了三种3D深度学习模型和一种机器学习模型。

Result: KPConv模型表现最佳，结合多波长光谱特征后，分割精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 多光谱LiDAR技术在自动化森林成分分割中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

Motivation: 现有MIL方法依赖置换不变性，限制了其在WSI分析中捕捉实例间语义相关性的能力。

Method: 提出一种Siamese网络解决方案，通过学习恢复实例的随机排列顺序来捕捉语义相关性。

Result: 在WSI分类和生存预测任务中，该方法优于现有MIL方法。

Conclusion: 通过解决实例拼图问题，可以更有效地捕捉WSI中实例间的语义相关性。

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)的新方法，用于全分辨率CT扫描中颅内颈动脉钙化(ICAC)的精细分段量化，解决了传统方法因降采样或局部处理而丢失全局上下文的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICAC总体积作为卒中生物标志物忽略了钙化位置的关键影响，而分段量化因技术限制难以实现。

Method: 将3D问题转化为1D轴向的并行概率地标定位任务，提出DST框架处理全分辨率CT切片序列，预测关键解剖地标的概率分布。

Result: 在100名患者的临床队列中，DST实现了0.1切片的平均绝对误差，96%预测在±1切片容差内，并在公开基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: DST是首个实现自动化分段ICAC分析的工具，为位置特异性生物标志物研究奠定基础。

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Result: 在十项医学体积任务中，Raptor性能优于现有方法（提升3%-14%），且无需训练。

Conclusion: Raptor为医学体积数据的深度学习提供了高效且通用的基础。

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注劳动密集且隐私敏感，导致高质量标注数据稀缺，现有集中式方法又易泄露隐私。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法防止过拟合，并引入高斯差分隐私噪声保护梯度；使用加权平均算法聚合本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据稀缺和隐私保护的双重挑战下，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Result: 在合成问题实验中，改进的TPE比原始方法能以更少的评估找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在Optuna中可用，为组合优化提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial

network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

TL;DR: InsightBuild结合因果分析和微调大语言模型，为建筑能源异常提供可读解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能建筑中能源异常缺乏明确解释的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：因果推断模块检测因果关系，LLM生成解释。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，提供清晰、精确的解释。

Conclusion: 结合因果发现与LLM生成，有效辅助能源管理。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界数据集中的缺失数据严重影响了机器学习模型的性能，而现有基于LLM的方法（如UnIMP）在捕捉复杂非线性相关性方面存在局限。

Method: 采用量子特征映射（由IQP电路生成）替代传统的经典输入嵌入，利用量子叠加和纠缠现象学习更丰富的数据表示。

Result: 在混合类型数据集上，Quantum-UnIMP将数值特征的插补误差降低了15.2%（RMSE），分类特征准确率提高了8.7%（F1-Score）。

Conclusion: 量子增强表示在复杂数据插补任务中具有巨大潜力，即使使用近期量子硬件也能实现显著改进。

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLMs的数学推理能力是AI发展的关键挑战，但目前缺乏系统的方法来结合SFT和RL以优化准确性和效率。

Method: 通过延长SFT阶段提升模型准确性，再通过GRPO阶段优化解决方案长度，保持性能的同时提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，延长SFT至10个周期对性能突破至关重要，GRPO则显著优化了解决方案长度。该方法在AIMO竞赛中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发高准确性和高效率的数学推理模型提供了实用方案，并开源了完整框架以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will
open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and
training configurations at

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，显著降低计算成本，同时保持性能，适用于长序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的高计算成本问题。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机频谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源。

Conclusion: WERSA为低资源硬件上的长上下文模型提供了更实用、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构路由不灵活、稀疏性不足的问题，以适应低资源条件和主流加速技术。

Method: 引入结合ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器，设计CLS感知训练目标，并实现高效加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在稀疏性和加速性能上优于基线，TLS达80%，8-token CLS达70%，端侧设备上加速3.67倍。

Conclusion: BlockFFN是一种高效且加速友好的MoE架构，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Result: 发现生成奖励模型普遍存在脆弱性，新模型显著提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调需要更可靠的LLM评估方法，并发布了鲁棒的奖励模型及训练数据。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Abstract: Transformers excel when dealing with sequential data. Generalizing
transformer models to geometric domains, such as manifolds, we encounter the

Result: 三种优化器结果相近，Sophia训练损失最低，Lion最快，AdamW下游任务表现最好。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，需根据具体需求选择。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Conclusion: LoGIC通过游戏化学习有效提升了无监督图像描述性能，展示了多智能体强化学习在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视不平衡协变量偏移这一复杂异质性，FedAKD旨在平衡准确预测与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD包含客户端和服务器更新：客户端使用异步知识蒸馏策略，服务器选择高置信度样本更新全局模型。

Result: 在FashionMNIST、CIFAR10和EHR数据集上，FedAKD显著提升公平性、准确性和客户端参与度。

Conclusion: FedAKD通过理论分析和实验验证，有效解决了联邦学习中的协作公平性问题。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时数据偏移是部署预测模型时的常见挑战，TTA虽能暂时适应，但模型最终会退化至失效。需要一种方法来监控性能并预警。

Method: 扩展了基于序列测试的监控工具，结合置信序列，适应模型在测试时更新且无标签数据的情况。

Result: 提出的框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控框架，能够统计严格地监控性能，并在失效时发出警报。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法在平衡灾难性遗忘缓解与新任务性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为缓解灾难性遗忘提供了新视角，通过关注训练末期参数活动，实现了更好的知识保留与新任务适应。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 标准NVAR和RC在混沌系统预测中表现有限，因其固定非线性结构和计算成本高，难以适应高噪声或高维数据。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习MLP，通过梯度优化联合训练，避免参数网格搜索。

Result: 在混沌系统中，自适应模型在预测精度和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动非线性学习，提升了预测性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

TL;DR: ORAC方法通过乐观探索和风险规避的结合，优化了RaCRL中的奖励-成本权衡，避免了保守探索导致的次优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RaCRL通常因风险规避导致保守探索，从而收敛到次优策略，无法最大化奖励或达成目标。

Method: 提出ORAC方法，通过最大化奖励值函数的局部上界和最小化风险规避成本值函数的局部下界，动态调整成本权重以鼓励探索。

Result: 实验证明ORAC在Safety-Gymnasium和CityLearn等任务中显著改善了奖励-成本权衡，避免了次优策略。

Conclusion: ORAC通过乐观探索和动态调整成本权重，有效解决了RaCRL中的保守探索问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.
