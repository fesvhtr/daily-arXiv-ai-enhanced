Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

### [4] [ViLLa: A Neuro-Symbolic approach for Animal Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14823)
*Harsha Koduri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLLa是一个神经符号框架，用于可解释的动物监测，结合视觉检测、语言解析和符号推理，回答自然语言查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够结合视觉数据和自然语言查询的动物监测系统，提供模块化和透明性。

Method: ViLLa框架包含视觉检测模块、语言解析器和符号推理层，通过逻辑推理回答查询。

Result: 系统在动物图像任务中表现良好，能够将视觉内容与结构化查询结合。

Conclusion: ViLLa通过模块化设计实现了可解释的动物监测，优于黑盒模型。

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

### [5] [GraphGSOcc: Semantic and Geometric Graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825)
*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphGSOcc模型，结合语义和几何图Transformer改进3D高斯泼溅方法，解决特征聚合和边界模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法存在特征聚合忽略语义关联和边界模糊问题。

Method: 提出Dual Gaussians Graph Attention，动态构建几何图和语义图，结合多尺度注意力优化边界和拓扑。

Result: 在SurroundOcc数据集上mIoU达24.10%，GPU内存降至6.1GB，性能提升1.97%，内存减少13.7%。

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc模型有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，兼顾语义和几何约束。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

### [6] [DAVID-XR1: Detecting AI-Generated Videos with Explainable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14827)
*Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Hongyu Su,Juncheng Li,Yunhan Zhao,Lin Luo,Zixing Chen,Li Wang,Xin Wang,Yixu Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了DAVID-X数据集和DAVID-XR1模型，用于透明化地检测AI生成视频，并提供细粒度的缺陷分析和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频的普及，现有方法仅能进行二分类检测，缺乏透明性和细粒度证据。

Method: 引入DAVID-X数据集，包含缺陷级时空标注和文字解释，并开发DAVID-XR1模型进行可解释的视觉推理。

Result: 模型在多种生成器和模式下表现出强泛化能力，验证了可解释检测方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 可解释的检测方法为AI生成视频的透明识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

### [8] [MSNeRV: Neural Video Representation with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15276)
*Jun Zhu,Xinfeng Zhang,Lv Tang,JunHao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNeRV是一种基于多尺度特征融合的隐式神经表示方法，用于视频压缩，解决了现有方法在细节密集和快速变化视频内容上的不足，并在压缩效率上超越了VTM-23.7。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示（INR）方法在细节密集和快速变化的视频内容上表现不佳，主要原因是网络特征利用不足和缺乏视频特定的设计。

Method: 提出MSNeRV框架，包括时间窗口增强时间一致性、GoP级网格表示背景、多尺度空间解码器和自适应损失函数，以及多尺度特征块。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在视频表示和压缩方面表现优于现有INR方法，并在动态场景中超越VTM-23.7。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了视频压缩性能，为INR在视频领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

producing initial concepts and exploring novel 3D forms. However, objectively
analyzing the differences between human-designed and machine-generated 3D forms
remains a challenge, limiting our understanding of their respective strengths

*Xinqi Fan,Jingting Li,John See,Moi Hoon Yap,Wen-Huang Cheng,Xiaobai Li,Xiaopeng Hong,Su-Jing Wang,Adrian K. Davision*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了面部微表情（MEs）的识别、定位和生成，提出结合定位与识别的统一任务（ME-STR）和基于多模态大模型的视觉问答任务（ME-VQA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将微表情定位和识别分开处理，在真实场景中效果不佳，而多模态大模型的出现为改进ME分析提供了新途径。

Method: 提出ME-STR任务（统一序列流程）和ME-VQA任务（利用多模态大模型进行视觉问答）。

Result: MEGC 2025竞赛引入这两个任务，要求算法在测试集上运行并提交结果。

Conclusion: 通过整合任务和多模态大模型，有望提升微表情分析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a
leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

system designed for resource-constrained environments. We have proposed a
formal entropy-based adaptive frame buffering algorithm and integrated that
with MobileNetV2 to achieve high throughput with low latency. The system is
capable of processing live streams of video with sub-50ms end-to-end inference
latency on resource-constrained devices (embedding platforms) such as Raspberry
Pi, Amazon, and NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Our method maintains over 92% detection

### [12] [MonoVQD: Monocular 3D Object Detection with Variational Query Denoising and Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14835)
*Kiet Dang Vu,Trung Thai Tran,Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD是一个基于DETR的单目3D检测框架，通过引入掩码分离自注意力机制、变分查询去噪技术和自蒸馏策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DETR在单目3D检测中的性能限制问题。

Method: 1. 掩码分离自注意力机制；2. 变分查询去噪技术；3. 自蒸馏策略。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优异，具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MonoVQD通过创新方法显著提升了单目3D检测性能，并适用于多场景。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [13] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构化指令的迭代优化方法ChartIR，用于提升多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和准确的代码翻译能力。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分，设计结构化指令（描述和差异指令）并采用两阶段生成与迭代优化流程。

Result: 实验表明，ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化显著提升了图表到代码生成的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

### [14] [PictSure: Pretraining Embeddings Matters for In-Context Learning Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14842)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictSure是一个专注于图像嵌入模型的ICL框架，通过系统分析嵌入模型的架构、预训练和训练动态，显著提升少样本图像分类的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域，构建图像分类模型困难，传统方法依赖大量标注数据。ICL为少样本分类提供了新思路，但现有研究忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出PictSure框架，系统研究视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功率和跨域性能。PictSure在跨域任务中优于现有ICL模型，同时保持域内任务可比性能。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型设计，为少样本图像分类提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其在跨域场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Motivation: 核大小选择对CNN的性能至关重要，但常被忽视。BKSEF旨在解决这一问题，通过理论支持优化核大小。

Method: BKSEF结合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，提出了一种数学框架，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，BKSEF指导的模型实现了最高3.1%的准确率提升和42.8%的FLOPs减少。

Conclusion: BKSEF证明核大小是可优化的参数，为高效和任务感知的CNN设计提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

### [16] [Efficient Retail Video Annotation: A Robust Key Frame Generation Approach for Product and Customer Interaction Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14854)
*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，通过关键帧识别和对象检测技术，显著降低了人工标注成本，同时保持了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖耗时的人工标注，成本高且不鲁棒，需要自动化解决方案以提高效率和降低成本。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧的判别特征，结合零售环境定制的对象检测技术，实现关键帧自动识别和标注。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性上与人工标注相当，同时节省了50%的成本，且仅需人工验证少于5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了零售视频标注的效率，适用于顾客行为分析、产品交互检测等多种零售应用。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经不确定性映射的主动视角选择方法（UPNet），用于高效3D重建，显著减少计算开销并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中如何选择最具信息量的视角以减少冗余计算并提高效率的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络UPNet预测不确定性映射，通过启发式方法选择最优视角，训练3D神经渲染模型。

Result: 方法仅需一半视角即可达到与上限相当的精度，计算速度提升400倍，资源消耗减少50%以上。

Conclusion: UPNet在高效3D重建中表现优异，且无需额外训练即可泛化到新物体类别。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Motivation: 确保T2I模型生成的图像忠实于用户意图，同时保持安全性和公平性，是当前研究的重要挑战。

Method: 提出DPO-Kernels方法，包括混合损失、核化表示和发散选择，并引入DETONATE基准和AQI指标。

Result: 实验表明，DPO-Kernels通过HT-SR保持了强泛化能力，并揭示了潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels为T2I模型的对齐问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，并通过公开基准和代码推动了进一步研究。

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Result: 在5个多图像基准和3个单图像基准上，PeRL显著优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像任务中表现优异，同时在单图像任务中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在医学图像等敏感领域的应用引发了隐私问题，现有MIA方法依赖重建误差，但在医学图像中效果不佳。

Method: 提出FCRE方法，通过分析反向扩散过程，计算中频重建误差和结构相似性指数，确定成员资格。

Result: 实验表明，FCRE方法在多个医学图像数据集上优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像中MIA的挑战，为隐私风险评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Conclusion: ViT架构在喷注分类中表现出色，为未来研究提供了系统框架和基准数据集。

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图中的文本提供了丰富的地理、历史和文化信息，但由于缺乏有效的提取方法和训练数据，传统方法难以应对多样化的地图样式。

Method: 提出PALETTE，结合超局部采样模块和位置嵌入，优化文本边界点和字符的检测与识别；同时开发SynthMap+自动生成合成数据用于训练。

Result: PALETTE在两种历史地图基准数据集上优于现有方法，尤其擅长处理长文本和旋转文本，并已应用于6万张地图的文本标注。

Conclusion: PALETTE和SynthMap+为历史地图文本提取提供了高效解决方案，支持大规模地图搜索应用。

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer是一个统一的训练和推理框架，解决了传统风格迁移方法的问题，支持艺术家级风格迁移和文本驱动风格化。


<details>

Motivation: 传统风格迁移方法存在多种问题，且不同任务的框架不统一。StyleWallfacer旨在通过语义风格注入和数据增强策略解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 基于BLIP的语义风格注入方法；2. 基于人类反馈的数据增强策略；3. 训练自由的三重扩散过程。

Result: 实现了高质量的图像驱动风格迁移和文本驱动风格化，首次在风格迁移过程中实现图像颜色编辑。

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer为风格迁移领域提供了高效、统一的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Result: 实验和理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实现了近100%的码书利用率。

Conclusion: 通过分布对齐，显著改善了向量量化的性能。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化提示选择，显著提升了无训练少样本医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了点云分析中的问题，实验和可视化结果验证了其合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across

### [29] [ReSeDis: A Dataset for Referring-based Object Search across Large-Scale Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15180)
*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis统一了文本到图像检索与像素级定位，提出了一个结合检索与定位的新任务，并设计了相应的基准和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术要么专注于视觉定位（但假设对象存在于所有测试图像中），要么专注于文本到图像检索（但缺乏细粒度定位），无法同时解决大规模视觉搜索的双重问题。

Method: 提出了Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis)任务，结合了检索与定位，并设计了一个基准和任务特定指标。

Result: 提供了一个零样本基线，展示了未来研究的潜力。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为构建下一代鲁棒且可扩展的多模态搜索系统提供了一个现实的测试平台。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过视觉上下文学习（VICL）训练通用模型，用于视网膜光学相干断层扫描（OCT）领域，并提出了针对VICL的评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像分析中的专用模型虽性能优异，但适用性有限，需要大量资源和专业知识。通用模型则能灵活适应不同任务，无需专门开发。

Method: 使用视觉上下文学习（VICL）训练通用模型，使其能基于少量示例在推理时泛化到不同任务。

Result: 在多个视网膜OCT数据集上评估了先进的医学VICL方法，建立了首个基线，展示了其潜力与当前局限。

Conclusion: 论文为OCT领域的上下文学习提供了初步成果，并开源代码以促进进一步研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

*Xuelin Shen,Jiayin Xu,Kangsheng Yin,Wenhan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PSIC的图像压缩方法，通过多解码选项保护隐私，同时保留图像压缩功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言预训练模型语义理解能力的提升，公开图像的隐私保护需求日益迫切。

Method: 提出PSIC方法，结合CLTG模块和UAEO优化函数，支持多解码选项和自适应多目标优化。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个下游任务中有效，既能保护隐私，又能保持图像质量。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种即插即用的解决方案，可集成到现有图像压缩模型中，实现隐私与质量的平衡。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于两阶段扩散模型的融合网络（DM-FNet），用于多模态医学图像融合（MMIF），通过增强特征识别能力和自适应处理不同模态图像，显著提升了融合图像的质量和信息密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMIF方法在捕捉细节特征和跨模态特征交互方面存在不足，导致融合图像质量不理想。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段通过UNet进行图像重建，捕捉细节信息；第二阶段将噪声图像输入融合网络，增强特征识别能力，并结合三种关键融合模块自适应处理不同模态图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在客观评价指标上表现优异，融合图像保留了适当的亮度、放射性示踪剂分布、丰富纹理和清晰边缘。

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过两阶段扩散模型和自适应融合模块，显著提升了多模态医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code
is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

TL;DR: 视频-SALMONN 2是一种先进的视听大语言模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和定向偏好优化（DPO）提升视频描述生成能力，并提出多轮DPO（MrDPO）进一步优化训练。实验显示，其性能超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频包含丰富信息，生成准确的自然语言描述是视频理解的关键。现有模型在描述完整性和准确性上仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出视频-SALMONN 2模型，结合LoRA和DPO技术，并引入MrDPO方法，周期性更新参考模型和LoRA模块，结合真实标注稳定训练。

Result: MrDPO显著提升模型性能，错误率降低28%。7B参数的视频-SALMONN 2在视频描述任务中超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2通过MrDPO优化，在视频描述和问答任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C-AFBiFPN的特征增强与融合框架，用于解决SAR船舶检测中的多尺度变化、小目标噪声和复杂背景问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR船舶检测面临多尺度变化、小目标噪声和复杂背景等挑战，需要更有效的特征表示和融合方法。

Result: 在SSDD数据集上，该方法显著提升了小目标检测精度、抗遮挡鲁棒性和多尺度特征适应性。

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN框架有效解决了SAR船舶检测的关键问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-NeRF是一种新方法，能够在复杂相机轨迹下预测高精度相机位姿，结合NeRF和流驱动位姿调节，提升重建鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确相机位姿先验，复杂轨迹下表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 采用增量式流程，结合NeRF的光度一致性和流驱动位姿调节，引入隐式位姿滤波器。

Result: 在Tanks&Temple和NeRFBuster数据集上，RA-NeRF在位姿估计和视觉质量上均达到最优。

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂轨迹下表现优异，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RetroMem的回忆增强COD架构，通过整合历史知识动态调整伪装模式感知和推理，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法缺乏历史上下文机制，限制了在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），包括DMA捕获多尺度信息，DMM和IPR利用历史知识重构推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态整合历史知识，有效提升了伪装场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DBACS方法在半导体领域的领域自适应中表现优异，为减少资源消耗和提高效率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code
will be available.

Result: 在两个公共病理数据集上，OpenPath显著提升模型性能，优于现有开集AL方法。

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高效样本选择和避免OOD数据，显著减少标注成本并提升分类性能。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Conclusion: 几何感知的纹理映射方法显著提升了动物个体再识别的准确性，尤其在多样姿态和视角下表现优异。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

TL;DR: DDIS是一种基于扩散模型的数据自由图像合成方法，通过引入领域对齐指导和类别对齐标记，显著提升了合成图像的质量和对训练数据分布的逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源预训练模型在训练数据不可用时效用下降，现有数据自由图像合成方法因缺乏自然图像先验知识导致合成样本偏离训练数据分布。

Method: 提出DDIS方法，利用文本到图像扩散模型作为图像先验，结合领域对齐指导（DAG）和类别对齐标记（CAT），优化合成图像与训练数据分布的对齐。

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上的实验表明，DDIS优于现有方法，生成更符合训练数据分布的样本，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DDIS通过扩散模型和领域对齐指导，有效解决了数据自由图像合成中的分布偏离问题，为数据自由应用提供了高质量合成图像。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，模型的可靠性至关重要，而OOD样本的检测是衡量可靠性的重要指标。现有方法可能无法完全捕捉OOD样本的多样性，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出NERO机制，通过聚类神经元级相关性形成类中心，并引入相关性距离度量新样本与中心的偏差。结合特征范数和偏置项的缩放相关性，进一步优化性能。

Result: 在胃肠道影像数据集Kvasir和GastroVision上，NERO在多种深度学习架构中表现优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性和距离度量，显著提升了OOD检测能力，同时具备可解释性，适用于医学影像领域。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: 由于大规模4D HOI数据集的稀缺，现有方法难以实现高质量的4D人-物交互合成。

Method: 1) 使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中重建稀疏3D HOI关键帧；2) 提出ContactDM模型，通过接触感知编码器和注意力机制插值生成密集4D HOI序列。

Conclusion: GenHOI框架有效减少了对大规模4D HOI数据集的依赖，实现了高质量的4D HOI合成。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖密集LiDAR监督，成本高且数据密集。RaCalNet旨在通过稀疏监督解决这一问题。

Method: RaCalNet通过重新校准和细化稀疏雷达点构建深度先验，作为单目深度预测的可靠锚点，避免密集监督。

Result: 在ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集和实际场景中，RaCalNet显著降低RMSE（35.30%和34.89%），并生成清晰细节的深度图。

Conclusion: RaCalNet证明了稀疏监督的可行性，性能优于密集监督方法，为高效深度估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Result: 实验表明，WinWinLay在元素布局控制和视觉真实感上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过创新的训练无关策略，显著提升了布局到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在参数效率和性能上均表现出色，适用于高分辨率遥感影像的弱监督处理。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定量结构模型（QSM）方法在个体树依赖、高质量点云数据需求和多预处理步骤方面存在局限性，限制了其可扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 采用创新的基于图的流程，无缝集成树分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建，通过路径和抽象等图操作进行树拓扑推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模非破坏性AGB估计提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案，减少了对专业预处理工具的依赖，并确立了ULS作为TLS的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DLoRAL的双LoRA学习范式，用于在视频超分辨率任务中同时实现细节增强和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的Real-VSR方法在保持时间一致性的同时牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。

Method: 通过交叉帧检索（CFR）模块和一致性-LoRA（C-LoRA）模块提取时间一致性先验，再通过细节-LoRA（D-LoRA）模块增强细节，交替优化。

Result: DLoRAL在单步扩散中实现了高质量的细节和时间一致性，实验表明其在准确性和速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习范式有效解决了Real-VSR中的细节与一致性平衡问题。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2M-Reg提出了一种新的多模态图像配准框架，通过单模态相似性训练模型，解决了传统方法在多模态配准中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像配准（如PET-MRI）在临床中很重要，但传统方法因模态差异大而效果不佳。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚。支持半监督学习。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg的DSC比现有方法高2倍，适用于PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决了多模态配准的挑战，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建的实时3D物体检测框架，结合预训练视觉基础模型和CLIP，通过多视图关联和优化模块实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法依赖密集点云重建，计算和内存开销大，难以实时部署。

Method: 利用Cubify Anything和CLIP进行单视图检测，通过关联模块和优化模块融合多视图检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上达到在线方法的最优性能，支持实时感知。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重建，计算高效，适用于大范围场景，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi是一个基于文本驱动的扩散框架，用于生成逼真且合理的人-物交互（HOI），通过Diffusion Noise Optimization（DNO）在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中直接优化，实现了物理正确性和真实性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人-物交互生成方法在真实性和物理正确性之间难以平衡，HOIDiNi旨在通过结构化的两阶段方法解决这一问题。

Method: HOIDiNi采用两阶段方法：对象中心阶段选择手-物接触位置，人类中心阶段优化全身动作以实现这一蓝图。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上的定量、定性和主观评估表明，HOIDiNi在接触精度、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够仅通过文本提示生成复杂且可控的交互动作，展示了其在人-物交互生成中的潜力。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在长期记忆和推理任务中的表现，特别是在机器人控制任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理长期记忆和大量图像数据时效率低下，限制了其在机器人控制任务中的应用。

Method: 在Habitat模拟器中设计了一个包含60个任务的基准测试，这些任务需要长期记忆和上下文感知能力。

Result: 提出了基准测试和基线模型，展示了当前模型的性能并指出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为评估和改进视觉语言模型在长期记忆和推理任务中的表现提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与性能之间存在矛盾：图像偏离人类感知的高保真度时，模型表现反而更好。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，发现高保真图像未必带来更好的模型表现，从而提出改进方法。

Method: 通过控制图像退化与风格变化，研究MLLMs表现；提出VQ-TTT模块，动态调整输入图像频率内容并微调浅层视觉编码器。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了MLLMs在所有数据集上的平均准确率，无需额外模型或数据。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs对视觉输入的独特偏好，强调需要自适应而非通用的高质量图像，以适应AI作为数据主要消费者的新时代。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR是一种两阶段推理框架，通过结合时间差分价值模型和边缘感知奖励调整，显著提升视觉语言模型的效率和输出保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在推理时搜索方法上存在计算成本高和低置信度生成未受惩罚的问题，导致持续幻觉。

Method: ViMaR分为两阶段：首阶段单次筛选最高价值候选描述；次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分，并引入边缘惩罚抑制低置信度生成。

Result: ViMaR在多个VLM架构上显著提升描述的可靠性、事实准确性、细节丰富性和解释性，速度提升4倍以上，且具备跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViMaR作为一种灵活、可扩展的解码策略，不仅提升生成质量，还能通过自训练进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，效果有限且泛化性差。

Method: 提出ECAD，利用遗传算法学习高效的缓存调度策略，无需修改网络参数或参考图像。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，ECAD显著提升推理速度（如PixArt-alpha加速至2.58倍）并改善生成质量（COCO FID提升4.47）。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且泛化性强的扩散模型加速方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

TL;DR: CALM结合符号推理与神经生成，通过多模态数据实现上下文敏感决策，填补逻辑与神经感知之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二值逻辑无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，且在多模态环境中需要人工干预，而神经网络虽能提取丰富上下文信息，但缺乏可解释的推理结构。CALM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CALM通过领域树表示谓词，利用神经网络迭代细化其模拟真值，并通过符号推理模块确保约束满足。

Result: 在填空物体放置任务中，CALM准确率达92.2%，优于传统逻辑（86.3%）和LLM（59.4%），且能生成符合逻辑约束和人类偏好的空间热图。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与神经网络的潜力，为下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

Result: 在AIME 2024上，T-PPO将训练效率提升至2.5倍，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T-PPO是一种高效且有效的改进方法，适用于提升长文本生成任务的训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Motivation: 传统启发式算法依赖人工设计且难以泛化，HeurAgenix旨在通过LLM自动生成和选择启发式策略，提升解决组合优化问题的效率和通用性。

Conclusion: HeurAgenix展示了LLM在自动生成和选择启发式策略方面的潜力，为组合优化问题提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在物理世界交互和网络推理之间存在割裂，限制了其在需要跨领域智能的任务中的应用。

Result: 实验显示现有AI系统与人类能力之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 论文为物理认知与网络知识访问的交叉领域提供了挑战与机遇，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Motivation: 海上物联网（MIoT）的计算需求快速增长，但任务不确定性导致计算卸载和资源分配效率低下，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出协作MEC框架，利用Lyapunov优化处理任务不确定性，将问题转化为马尔可夫博弈，并提出异构智能体软演员-评论家算法求解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能有效解决计算卸载和资源分配问题。

Conclusion: 通过无人机和船只的协作，结合优化算法，可高效应对海上物联网的不确定任务需求。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果关系的导航方法（CAN），通过引入因果理解模块提升导航性能，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航方法通常同时处理所有历史观测数据，忽略了数据内部的关联结构，限制了任务性能的进一步提升。

Method: 通过因果视角分析导航任务，提出Causality-Aware Navigation（CAN），包含一个因果理解模块以增强环境理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，CAN在多种任务和模拟环境中均优于基线方法，且因果理解模块在强化学习和监督学习场景中均有效。

Conclusion: CAN通过因果理解模块显著提升了导航性能，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Conclusion: LPA为FA工程师提供了一种高效的工具，能够无缝集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一框架，用于系统构建大语言模型（LLM）在多智能体重复游戏中的自然语言状态表示，解决了以往研究中状态表示对行为影响的模糊性和可比性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在动态环境中作为决策者表现出潜力，但其无状态特性需要自然语言历史表示。以往研究对游戏历史的编码方式缺乏系统性，影响了行为分析和研究间的可比性。

Method: 框架从三个维度描述状态表示方法：动作信息性、奖励信息性和提示风格（自然语言压缩）。应用于动态自私路由游戏，验证框架有效性。

Result: 研究发现，提供（1）历史摘要而非完整记录、（2）后悔信息而非原始收益、（3）有限他人动作信息的状态表示，使LLM行为更接近博弈论均衡预测且更稳定。

Conclusion: 状态表示对LLM行为有显著影响，特定表示方式能优化其决策表现，为未来研究提供了系统化工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的广泛应用，AI伦理和政策治理的需求日益增长，但现有计算机科学课程未能充分培养学生应对这些挑战的能力。

Method: 开发并试点了一个AI政策模块，包括技术作业和前后调查，评估学生对AI伦理和政策的认知变化。

Result: 试点后，学生对AI伦理影响的关注增加，对参与AI政策讨论的信心提升。

Conclusion: AI政策模块是培养学生应对AI伦理和政策挑战的有效工具。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出过度思考，导致效率低下和推理成本增加，研究旨在揭示并解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) Efficiency Steering，一种无需训练的激活导向技术；2) Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL，通过强化学习动态平衡准确性和简洁性。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，两种方法显著减少推理长度，同时保持或提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过引导模型内在能力，可以自我提升推理效率，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Motivation: 现有代理系统生成框架缺乏完全自主性，限制了适应性和可扩展性。

Result: 在六项真实任务中，SwarmAgentic显著优于基线方法，如在TravelPlanner任务中相对提升261.8%。

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic为全自动代理系统设计提供了可扩展的解决方案，结合了群体智能与多代理生成。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中广泛应用，但其空间分辨率有限，影响视觉质量。传统VSR技术无法解决360度视频的投影失真问题，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出了一种名为S3PO的深度学习模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，设计了专用特征提取器和损失函数以解决球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上优于大多数传统VSR模型和360度专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性设计和优化，有效提升了360度视频的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，现有研究很少处理不连续和重叠实体的挑战，因此需要构建一个专门针对老年患者AE提取的标注数据集。

Method: 构建了一个包含14种临床显著AE的手工标注语料库，支持不连续和重叠实体。使用FlairNLP评估了多种模型在三种标注粒度（细粒度、粗粒度、带否定的粗粒度）下的性能。

Result: BERT-cased等模型在文档级粗粒度提取中表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度实体级任务中性能显著下降（F1=0.675），尤其是罕见事件和复杂属性。

Conclusion: 尽管文档级任务表现良好，细粒度AE提取仍面临挑战，尤其是在罕见事件和复杂临床语言的处理上。该数据集为未来研究提供了基准，并支持跨数据集泛化。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练时不要求模型了解约束条件，导致测试时约束解码的输出质量较低。

Method: BoostCD 分两阶段：阶段一分别进行约束和非约束解码，阶段二通过学习的自回归增强模型结合两种弱预测。

Result: BoostCD 在封闭信息提取任务中表现优于现有方法，解决了常见错误。

Conclusion: BoostCD 通过利用互补错误，显著提升了结构化 NLP 任务的性能。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

Conclusion: CrEst在噪声条件下仍保持鲁棒性，为LLM推理中的可信度评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively

allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and

*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的有效性，比较了零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法，发现专有模型（如GPT-4o）优于开源模型，且Gemma-2-27B在F1分数上超过传统机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD）评估六种LLMs（四种开源和两种专有模型），并与三种传统机器学习模型（随机森林、逻辑回归、SVM）比较，采用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少样本设置中准确率最高；Gemma-2-27B的F1分数超过传统模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需优化提示工程和混合方法以提升性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在无需修改权重的情况下精确重构文本的能力，并验证其在不同语言、序列长度和模型规模下的表现。

Method: 通过训练优化特殊记忆令牌的嵌入，使其能够提示模型重构固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集、最长240个令牌的序列及100M到8B参数的模型规模下，Llama 3.1 8B成功重构所有测试序列。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM的有趣能力，并提出了在记忆检索、压缩和可控文本生成中的潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

TL;DR: 该研究利用自然语言处理技术从执法和法医叙述中识别社会隔离和孤独感，开发了高质量的分类器，并分析了这些因素与自杀率的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年来显著增加，且与自杀率密切相关，但目前美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）未记录这些因素。研究旨在通过NLP技术填补这一空白。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典开发，并结合监督学习分类器，分析2002至2020年间30万例自杀案例。

Result: 开发出高质量分类器（平均F1：0.86，准确率：0.82），识别出1,198例慢性社会隔离案例。男性、同性恋或离婚者更易被分类为慢性社会隔离。

Conclusion: 该方法可改善美国社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一种用于评估开放式长文本生成的评分模型，通过区分好与坏的输出来指导GRPO训练，优于传统指标ROUGE-L和BERTScore。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时往往忽略关键方面（如连贯性、风格或相关性），或受预训练数据偏见影响，导致该问题研究不足。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于两个多样化的长文本风格和质量评分数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度的响应评估中表现可靠，且与人类偏好更一致。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，优于传统指标。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实中的广泛应用，后验遗忘能力变得至关重要，涉及隐私法规和内容更新等问题。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码方式对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述的作用。

Result: 转述描述学习可提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码方式对实现可靠的后验遗忘具有重要作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的省略和习语等语言特征常导致话语关系模糊，给解析带来挑战。

Method: 提出DCM模块，包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理；引入CPO优化DCM的输出以减少错误。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DCM和CPO的结合有效解决了对话话语解析中的歧义问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医学知识表示和临床部署效率方面存在不足，需改进。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型生成软标签，通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制将知识迁移至轻量级BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，诊断准确率提升9%，F1分数提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR框架显著提升资源利用效率和诊断准确性，为临床资源优化提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS），通过分解开放域对话生成任务，利用新数据集o2mDial和优化策略，提升小模型生成多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话具有一对多特性，现有LLM对话代理未显式建模此特性，导致多样性不足。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS），引入o2mDial数据集，并提出新的上下文学习和指令调优策略。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升小模型的响应多样性和质量（最高提升90%），接近大模型性能。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效解决了开放域对话的一对多问题，为小模型性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Motivation: 设计一种高效的韩语分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）而不影响模型性能。

Method: 采用规则预分词方法，结合韩语语言结构，创建种子词汇表，并使用分支熵选择算法。

Result: 实验显示，Thunder-Tok比BPE减少10%的分词数量，推理速度提升10%，且下游任务性能未受影响。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的方法能有效设计高效分词器，适用于语言模型。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Motivation: 探索语言模型中信息的保留和遗忘机制，以理解记忆的动态特性。

Method: 在Mamba架构上应用结构化回忆任务，分析U形准确率模式，识别三种记忆机制。

Result: 发现长期记忆由稀疏通道支持，短期记忆受delta调制递归控制，记忆分配受语义规律动态调节。

Conclusion: 验证了三种记忆机制的有效性，并通过大规模模型实验支持了发现。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务、通用推理和数学任务上分别提升4.7%、6.3%、4.0%和1.0%。

Conclusion: 原型学习增强泛化能力，验证了共享推理原型的假设。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如ROUGE和BERTScore）在捕捉语义相似性方面表现不佳，且现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观解释性。此外，现有方法未区分事实性和非事实性问题。

Method: MinosEval首先区分问题类型：事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，非事实性问题采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 实验表明，MinosEval在多个开放QA数据集上更符合人类标注结果，并提供更可解释的评估。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过针对性策略解决了开放QA评估的挑战，提升了评估质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Result: 性能下降主要源于语言变体本身，而非词汇重叠；编码器模型对西巴斯克语处理较差。

Conclusion: 语言变体对模型性能有显著影响，尤其是非标准方言，研究数据与代码已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented

knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving

*Juli Bakagianni,John Pavlopoulos,Aristidis Likas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopClustRAG是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的系统，结合稀疏和密集索引的混合检索策略，通过K-Means聚类分组语义相似的段落，生成多样且相关的答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模网络语料库中的端到端问答问题，提升答案的多样性、相关性和忠实性。

Method: 采用混合检索策略和K-Means聚类，生成聚类特定的提示，通过LLM生成中间答案，再经过过滤、重排和综合。

Result: 在FineWeb Sample-10BT数据集上，TopClustRAG在忠实性排名第2，正确性排名第7。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的上下文过滤和提示聚合在大规模RAG系统中有效。

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Thunder-DeID的去标识化框架，用于解决韩国法院判决公开时个人数据保护不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法院判决的去标识化过程无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律定义模糊，技术实现困难。

Method: 构建首个韩语法律数据集，系统化分类个人身份信息（PII），开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在法院判决去标识化任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术之间的脱节问题，为大规模去标识化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文综述了LLM在临床试验招募中的应用，分析了现有方法的局限性，并探讨了未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在关键领域（如临床试验招募）应用有限。希望通过LLM的知识聚合和推理能力改进试验与患者的匹配。

Method: 分析了现有LLM辅助方法的局限性，包括依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，并综述了相关任务、方法和评估框架。

Result: 指出了LLM在临床研究中应用的挑战，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: LLM在临床试验招募中潜力巨大，但需解决现有问题以实现更广泛应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

*Negar Foroutan,Jakhongir Saydaliev,Ye Eun Kim,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于监督对比学习（SCL）的方法，用于提升低资源语言的跨领域语言识别（LID）性能，效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在语言识别任务中因数据单一（如圣经）导致的性能不佳和偏差问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习低资源语言的领域不变表示。

Result: 在跨领域数据上，低资源语言的LID性能提升了3.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了低资源语言的LID性能，尤其在跨领域场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

*Camila Zurdo Tagliabue,Heloisa Oss Boll,Aykut Erdem,Erkut Erdem,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了DeVisE框架，用于评估大型语言模型在临床决策中的细粒度理解能力，发现零样本模型在反事实推理上更一致，而微调模型更稳定但对临床变化的响应较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法难以区分大型语言模型在临床决策中的真实医学推理与表面模式，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 构建了MIMIC-IV ICU出院记录的原始和模板版本数据集，通过反事实变量（人口统计和生命体征）评估五种LLM的输入敏感性和下游推理能力。

Result: 零样本模型在反事实推理上表现更一致，微调模型更稳定但对临床变化响应较差；人口统计因素对输出有持续影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试有助于揭示临床LLM的推理策略，为设计更安全、透明的医疗AI系统提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

*Arijit Maji,Raghvendra Kumar,Akash Ghosh,Anushka,Sriparna Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SANSKRITI是一个评估语言模型对印度文化多样性的理解的基准数据集，包含21,853个问题-答案对，覆盖28个邦和8个中央直辖区，测试16个文化属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在全球应用中的有效性依赖于对本地社会文化背景的理解，但目前缺乏针对印度文化多样性的评估工具。

Method: 通过构建SANSKRITI数据集，涵盖印度文化的16个关键属性，评估主流语言模型（LLMs、ILMs、SLMs）的表现。

Result: 许多模型在处理文化相关查询时表现不佳，尤其是在地区特定背景下。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了COSMMIC数据集，填补了印度语言多模态和多语言摘要研究的空白，结合文本、图像和用户评论提升摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度语言在多模态和多语言摘要研究中资源有限，需要填补这一空白并提升摘要质量。

Method: 构建包含9种印度语言的COSMMIC数据集，结合文本、评论和图像，使用先进模型（如LLama3和GPT-4）评估不同配置。

Result: 数据集包含4,959篇文章和24,484条评论，通过实验验证了结合多模态数据的有效性。

Conclusion: COSMMIC填补了印度语言资源的空白，推动了多模态和多语言NLP研究，促进了包容性。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

### [106] [Targeted Lexical Injection: Unlocking Latent Cross-Lingual Alignment in Lugha-Llama via Early-Layer LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15415)
*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI)的新方法，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和对比学习目标，针对低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）的LLM进行微调，显著提升了词汇对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在大型语言模型（LLM）中表现不佳的问题，尤其是词汇对齐的挑战。

Method: 采用TLI方法，结合LoRA和对比学习，针对模型早期层（如第2层）的词汇对齐能力进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了623个斯瓦希里语-英语词对的词汇对齐（相似度从0.3211提升至0.4113），并在未见的63个词对上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强LLM在低资源语言中的词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种细粒度评估框架和Peak Sharpness Score（PSS）指标，以解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI代理中的幻觉问题，并通过上下文感知裁剪技术提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI代理中表现出系统性定位错误（幻觉），影响了可靠性，需要更精细的评估和改进方法。

Method: 提出了细粒度评估框架和PSS指标，并引入训练无关的上下文感知裁剪技术。

Result: 实验表明，框架和方法能提供可操作的见解，增强GUI代理行为的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升MLLMs在GUI代理中的可靠性提供了新的评估和改进方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统在任务复杂性和智能体数量增加时面临架构设计、泛化能力和性能保证的挑战。

Method: 采用分治并行架构、自适应协作引擎和智能体组织优化策略。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME和HumanEval等任务上表现优异，性能随任务难度增加而显著提升。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2为高效、通用的多智能体系统提供了全面解决方案，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE框架通过层次化推理能力评估LLMs，揭示其依赖统计记忆而非真实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在推理任务中的表现是否源于真实推理能力还是训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 提出RE-IMAGINE框架，通过符号表示生成多层级问题变体，评估LLMs在不同推理层级的表现。

Result: LLMs在问题变体上表现下降，表明其依赖统计记忆。

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE为评估和提升LLMs的推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文附加到响应中并仅计算响应标记的损失，显著提升了语言模型在文本和视觉领域的生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文并不能确保生成的响应基于外部知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法来增强模型的生成准确性。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，训练时将相关上下文附加到响应中，但仅计算响应标记的损失，屏蔽上下文部分。

Result: 实验表明，CINGS训练的模型在文本和视觉领域均表现出更强的生成准确性，且在多个基准测试中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CINGS通过隐式鼓励模型更依赖外部上下文，显著提升了生成准确性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高效、高质量自动过程注释的挑战。

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优异，推理性能提升，效率提高2.6倍。

Conclusion: SPARE在多领域推理任务中高效且有效，代码已公开。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架（EmoBi），用于检测文本中的夸张和隐喻。通过情感分析和双向交互，EmoBi显著提升了检测性能，实验结果显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义模糊和表达多样，检测难度较大。现有方法多关注表面特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互的作用。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过情感引导和交互提升检测效果，并设计了验证机制确保准确性。

Result: 实验表明，EmoBi在四个数据集上优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi和HYPO-L数据集上分别提升了28.1%和23.1%。

Conclusion: EmoBi通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测的效果，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在生成可信和基于引用的回答时的常见问题，如遗漏明确答案、错误引用或拒绝可用证据。

Method: 采用GRPO方法进行强化学习训练，结合两阶段优化策略（先优化答案和引用行为，再优化拒绝行为），并通过GPT-4蒸馏重新审视指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，结合推理的模型在多个数据集上显著优于仅基于指令的模型，尤其在处理不可回答查询和生成引用充分的回答时表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理、分阶段优化和基于结果的强化学习对构建更可信赖的LLM的重要性。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [114] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的新方法，旨在解决局部注意力忽略窗口外标记的问题，在性能和效率之间取得更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型完全忽略窗口外标记的内在限制，提升在短上下文场景中的效率。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和专门设计的线性注意力机制，以捕捉窗口外标记的信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION在512窗口大小下性能与全注意力模型相当，同时提升了长上下文性能。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在保持训练效率的同时，显著提升了局部注意力模型的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从模型权重中近似训练数据的方法，通过梯度选择公共文本库中匹配度最高的数据，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，研究旨在解决从模型权重中近似训练数据的问题。

Method: 采用梯度基方法，从大型公共文本库中选择匹配度最高的数据，并验证其在分类和监督微调任务中的有效性。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%，接近专家基准88%；在MSMARCO微调任务中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能从模型权重中有效恢复有用数据，显著提升模型性能，接近专家水平。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，通过预测性解码减少LLMs在实时语音聊天中的延迟，提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成首句延迟导致用户体验不佳，尤其是在计算能力有限的设备上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用用户说话时的预测性解码生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理。

Result: 模拟实验显示，PredGen在多种场景下将延迟降低约2倍，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen有效解决了LLMs在实时语音应用中的延迟问题，显著提升响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的性别包容性公平指数（GIFI），用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在二元和非二元性别上的公平性，并在22个主流LLMs上进行了广泛测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前的研究主要关注二元性别区分，而本文旨在填补非二元性别公平性评估的空白，推动LLMs在性别包容性上的改进。

Method: 引入GIFI指标，从多个层次（如代词使用、生成行为等）量化LLMs的性别包容性，并在22个不同规模和能力的LLMs上进行测试。

Result: 发现不同LLMs在性别包容性上存在显著差异，揭示了与性别标识相关的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，为未来性别公平性研究提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对多模态科学声明验证的基准，SciVer填补了这一空白，旨在推动模型在科学文献中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含3000个专家标注示例的SciVer基准，覆盖四种推理类型，并评估了21种多模态基础模型的性能。

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务DiscoSG，用于处理多句视觉描述的文本场景图解析，并提出了数据集DiscoSG-DS和模型DiscoSG-Refiner，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析方法在处理多句描述时表现不佳，尤其是跨句共指现象，导致图碎片化和下游任务性能下降。

Method: 论文提出了DiscoSG任务，并构建了数据集DiscoSG-DS。随后提出了DiscoSG-Refiner模型，使用两个小型PLM分阶段生成和优化场景图。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比基线方法提升了约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，同时提升了下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句场景图解析方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WikiMixQA基准，用于评估跨模态推理能力，测试了12种先进视觉语言模型在长文档多模态推理中的表现，发现专有模型表现较好但仍有挑战，开源模型表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档理解（DU）面临复杂布局、表格和图表的挑战，现有视觉语言大模型（VLLMs）在长上下文视觉输入中的有效性尚不明确，需建立新基准评估跨模态推理能力。

Method: 构建WikiMixQA基准，包含1,000道多选题，基于4,000篇维基百科页面的表格和图表，测试模型的多模态信息合成能力。评估12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但在长文档检索场景下性能显著下降；GPT-4-o是唯一准确率超过50%的模型，开源模型最高准确率仅27%。

Conclusion: WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了关键基准，凸显了长上下文多模态推理的挑战，专有模型表现优于开源模型，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建不同难度和针对性的MCQs耗时且昂贵，生成式AI提供了自动化解决方案，但其质量和可靠性尚未充分研究，尤其是对非英语语言的探索不足。

Method: 研究使用生成模型为葡萄牙语阅读理解生成MCQs，涵盖课程相关叙事元素和不同难度，并通过专家评审和学生回答的心理测量学分析评估质量。

Result: 当前模型生成的MCQs质量接近人工创作，但在语义清晰度、可回答性及干扰项设计上仍存在问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在MCQ生成上具有潜力，但需进一步优化语义和干扰项设计，以提升实际应用效果。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究后悔机制对提升模型可靠性和理解神经网络认知编码至关重要。

Method: 通过设计提示场景构建后悔数据集，提出S-CDI指标优化后悔表示层，以及RDS/GIC指标分析后悔神经元。

Result: 成功识别最优后悔表示层，发现M形解耦模式，并将神经元分为三类功能组。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标有效揭示了后悔机制，为模型可靠性研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文化沟通中的误解常源于细微的解读差异，但不确定是字面意义还是语用因素（如礼貌和简洁）导致。

Method: 通过三个实验和计算认知模型，分析英式和美式英语使用者对强化词的理解。

Result: 跨文化差异源于字面意义和话语成本权重的组合，而非单纯的语义或礼貌规范。

Conclusion: 跨文化解读差异是字面意义与语用因素复杂互动的结果。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在生成任务中遵循指定概念顺序的能力，并评估其组合泛化和指令遵循能力。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估LLMs生成句子时是否遵循指定概念顺序。

Result: 分析36种LLMs发现，模型虽理解指令意图，但输出多样性低，最佳模型仅达75%有序覆盖率。

Conclusion: LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化方面仍需改进，Ordered CommonGen为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,

for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多任务中表现出色，但其推理的一致性和鲁棒性仍有不足。

Method: 采用基于队列的一致性学习（CC-Learn），通过强化学习优化复合目标（队列准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚），以统一推理模式。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 队列级强化学习能有效增强大语言模型的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Motivation: 挑战推理痕迹内部安全的假设，揭示其中可能包含敏感用户数据。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，分析推理步骤增加对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 推理步骤增加虽提高模型谨慎性，但也导致更详细的推理痕迹和更多隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 安全性需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅是最终输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估机器翻译系统在性别模糊翻译中的表现，避免性别歧视和代表性伤害。

Method: 通过分析21种机器翻译系统在三种不同难度的翻译方向中的表现，分类并讨论实际观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 大多数系统未能实现性别中立翻译，仅有少数系统采用特定策略，且受目标语言影响。

Conclusion: 性别中立翻译在机器翻译中仍不普遍，需进一步改进以避免性别偏见。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

TL;DR: GenRecal是一种通用的蒸馏框架，通过Recalibrator对齐异构视觉语言模型（VLMs）的特征表示，实现跨模型知识迁移，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在资源受限设备上部署困难，且模型架构多样，限制了知识蒸馏的应用。

Method: 提出GenRecal框架，包含Recalibrator模块，用于对齐异构VLMs的特征表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GenRecal显著提升性能，优于大规模开源和闭源VLMs。

Conclusion: GenRecal为异构VLMs的知识蒸馏提供了通用解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PhantomHunter，一种专门用于检测来自未见过的、私有调优LLM生成文本的检测器，通过家族感知学习框架捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的共享特征，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，错误信息生产和学术不端等社会问题加剧，现有检测器对私有调优LLM生成的文本检测效果不佳，亟需解决。

Method: 提出PhantomHunter，采用家族感知学习框架，捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的家族级共享特征，而非记忆个体特征。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验显示，PhantomHunter优于7个基线方法和3个工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，为解决LLM滥用问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

TL;DR: SonicVerse是一个多任务音乐描述模型，结合了描述生成与辅助音乐特征检测任务，通过投影架构将音频输入转换为语言标记，提升描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为音乐数据库提供准确的描述，推动音乐AI研究。

Method: 采用多任务框架，结合描述生成与音乐特征检测（如调性、人声检测），通过投影架构将音频和特征转换为语言标记。

Result: 实验表明，结合音乐特征提升了生成的描述的细节和质量。

Conclusion: SonicVerse能生成丰富的音乐描述，并为长音乐片段提供时间信息描述。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Conclusion: OCR语音合成系统为视障人士提供了更便捷的知识获取方式。

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,

(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Motivation: 传统手动处理大规模声学数据效率低下，亟需自动化工具以提高处理效率和准确性。

Method: 利用PNW-Cnet模型开发了pycnet-audio工具，支持检测多种森林野生动物声音及环境噪声。

Result: pycnet-audio能够高效处理大规模声学数据，检测约80种野生动物声音及多种噪声。

Conclusion: pycnet-audio为声学数据提供了一种实用的自动化处理方案，适用于野生动物研究和环境监测。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8
trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture
to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers
that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization
complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

Conclusion: PFMBench为蛋白质基础模型的评估和发展提供了重要工具和参考。

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（如GPT-4）提取经济叙事的潜力，并与专家标注结果对比，发现其表现尚不及专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来经济叙事研究兴起，但现有自然语言处理技术（如BERT）缺乏深层语义理解能力，无法区分经济叙事提取与传统任务。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，应用严格叙事定义，比较GPT-4输出与专家标注的黄金标准。

Result: GPT-4能以结构化格式提取有效经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以应对复杂任务，并为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Result: 在四足机器人和四旋翼上的实验表明，F-MPPI显著提升了控制性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: F-MPPI适用于复杂机器人系统的高频鲁棒控制。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

Conclusion: FEAST成功满足了个性化需求，展示了在真实环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we
examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a

neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps
for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a
crowded street.

Result: 实验表明，RIP在低数据场景下任务成功率至少提高26%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RIP算法有效解决了LLM即时策略的幻觉问题，提升了机器人模仿学习的可靠性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM是一种多相机全向物体SLAM系统，利用环绕视角相机配置在复杂户外场景中实现鲁棒、一致且语义丰富的建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，存在视野窄、遮挡敏感和深度感知有限等问题，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: MCOO-SLAM结合点特征和物体级地标，引入语义-几何-时间融合策略，设计全向闭环模块，并构建分层3D场景图。

Result: 实验表明，MCOO-SLAM在定位和物体级建图方面表现准确，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM为复杂户外场景提供了鲁棒且语义丰富的SLAM解决方案。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a
consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction.
We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building
(17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and
performance enhancements in diverse scenarios. Challenges encountered during
the scanning are addressed through proposed solutions, while we also explore

*Yufeng Zhang,Wenrui Dai,Hang Yu,Shizhan Liu,Junhui Hou,Jianguo Li,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ABC框架通过贝叶斯网络结构学习实现神经图像压缩（NIC）的计算可扩展性，解决了现有方法在计算复杂度控制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIC的计算需求阻碍了其广泛应用，现有方法缺乏对计算复杂度的全面控制。

Method: ABC提出异构二分贝叶斯网络（管理神经网络主干计算）、同构多分贝叶斯网络（优化自回归单元处理）和自适应控制模块。

Result: 实验表明ABC实现了计算可扩展性，同时保持压缩性能。

Conclusion: ABC是一个通用解决方案，可集成到多种NIC架构中，确保计算可扩展性。

Abstract: Neural Image Compression (NIC) has revolutionized image compression with its
superior rate-distortion performance and multi-task capabilities, supporting
both human visual perception and machine vision tasks. However, its widespread
adoption is hindered by substantial computational demands. While existing
approaches attempt to address this challenge through module-specific
optimizations or pre-defined complexity levels, they lack comprehensive control
over computational complexity. We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure
learning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel,
comprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC
components through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC
introduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet
(inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a
homogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing
autoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that
dynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input
data complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that
ABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity
and broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression
performance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with
various NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a
robust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Edge Impulse和深度学习模型的实时糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）检测方法，适用于边缘设备，具有高准确性和资源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是全球糖尿病患者视力受损的主要原因，传统诊断方法耗时且资源密集，亟需一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 研究使用TensorFlow训练多种CNN模型（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet、SqueezeNet和自定义DNN），并通过预处理和量化技术优化模型，部署到边缘设备。

Result: MobileNet准确率达96.45%，SqueezeNet模型仅176KB，延迟17ms，适合实时检测；其他模型在资源效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face是一个基于面部图像的基础模型，通过微调用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测，在公开数据集和癌症患者中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究面部外观作为健康非侵入性窗口的潜力，开发能够准确估计生物年龄和预测生存风险的模型。

Method: FAHR-Face通过两阶段微调分别训练年龄估计和生存预测模型，测试了模型的鲁棒性和独立性，并在临床数据集中验证。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在公开数据集上误差最低（5.1年），FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率，两者结合提高了预后准确性。

Conclusion: 基础模型能够生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，有效捕捉生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究了Transformer模型（UNETR和SwinUNETR）在T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的表现，发现SwinUNETR在标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性方面表现优于传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MRI图像中前列腺分割的读者间变异性和跨站点域偏移问题，探索Transformer模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 比较UNETR、SwinUNETR和3D UNet模型，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列和基于腺体大小的数据集），使用Optuna调参。

Result: SwinUNETR在Dice相似系数上表现最佳，尤其在腺体大小子集中提升高达5分，优于UNETR和3D UNet。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR通过全局和移位窗口自注意力机制显著提升了分割精度和鲁棒性，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

*Paula Feldman,Miguel Fainstein,Viviana Siless,Claudio Delrieux,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于递归变分神经网络（RvNN）的方法，用于生成复杂且多样化的血管结构，解决了现有规则方法无法捕捉真实解剖数据多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解剖树在临床诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但现有方法难以准确表示其复杂的拓扑和几何结构。

Method: 使用递归变分神经网络（RvNN），学习血管的分层组织，编码分支连接性和几何特征，生成新的血管几何结构。

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度等方面与真实数据高度相似，适用于医学训练和血流模拟等用途。

Conclusion: RvNN首次用于血管合成，生成的模型既准确又多样，为医学领域提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态学习显著提升了神经退行性疾病的诊断性能，展示了在真实临床数据中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的分类模型，用于准确分类8种不同的多参数MRI序列，以提高放射科医生的工作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多参数MRI（mpMRI）序列的DICOM头信息常因协议多样性和人为错误而不准确，影响诊断效率。

Method: 使用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet等多种深度学习模型对8种MRI序列进行分类，并比较性能。

Result: DenseNet-121模型表现最佳，F1分数和准确率分别为0.966和0.972，且在外部数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在内外数据集上均能高效分类MRI序列，适合临床应用。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VQGAN和同态加密（HE）的医学图像推理框架，通过压缩图像和多项式逼近激活函数，显著降低计算负担，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像包含敏感信息，需要隐私保护，但同态加密推理计算成本高，尤其是大图像（如胸部X光片）。

Method: 使用VQGAN压缩图像为潜在表示，用低阶多项式逼近激活函数，并引入挤压激励模块优化框架。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上测试，压缩因子为8时性能与计算成本达到最优平衡，HE推理虽慢但实用性强。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时，显著降低了HE推理的计算负担，展现了医学图像中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Result: 在CAMELYON16和CAMELYON17等任务中，FedWSIDD提升了分类性能，同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedWSIDD是一种高效且隐私保护的WSI分类解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对超小型模拟图像传感器的混合去噪系统，解决了内窥镜图像中的噪声问题，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超小型内窥镜传感器因光敏区域有限和模拟信号传输导致噪声问题，影响诊断效果，需开发高效去噪方法。

Conclusion: 混合去噪系统显著改善了内窥镜图像质量，为超小型传感器的临床应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer
classification performance using CNN architectures.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估了LLM（如Llama）在生成描述方面的表现。研究发现，大多数描述基于示例，LLM能准确识别此类描述，但生成的描述仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，研究旨在了解开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估LLM在生成描述方面的能力。

Method: 使用NPM代码片段数据集（185,412个包，1,024,579个代码片段），从中选取400个样本进行手动分类和LLM评估。

Result: 55.5%的原始描述基于示例，LLM正确识别了79.75%的此类描述。生成的描述平均相似度为0.7173，显示相关性但需改进。

Conclusion: 代码片段的文档意图因任务而异，LLM在生成描述方面表现良好，但仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型神经网络架构，用于高分辨率预测三种类型的暴力冲突，并在分类和回归任务中均取得先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测高时空分辨率的暴力冲突是研究和政策制定的核心挑战。

Result: 模型在所有任务中均达到先进性能，并能生成预测不确定性分布。

Conclusion: 该模型具有高度扩展性，适用于早期预警系统和人道主义响应规划。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率需求图（PDGraph）的LLM应用服务系统Hermes，通过优化调度顺序和预热后端，显著提升了服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，无法有效处理动态需求。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模资源需求，采用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并结合PDGraph模型预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes将平均完成时间减少70%以上，P95完成时间减少80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过精确建模和智能调度，显著提升了LLM应用的服务效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足代理应用中依赖外部数据或环境上下文的复杂需求。

Method: 提出代理计划缓存方法，从已完成代理执行中提取计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量模型适配新任务。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，平均降低成本46.62%，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM代理服务提供了高效解决方案，可与现有基础设施互补。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Motivation: 探索自注意力机制的结构特性，以提升模型的可解释性和实用性。

Result: 发现自注意力对softmax激活的不变性，并展示了分层组织在模型剪枝和架构比较中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性分析和网络优化提供了理论和方法支持，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

Conclusion: DrRL在推荐准确性和鲁棒性上表现优越，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 微地震记录了地下流体注入过程中的应力状态和渗透性变化，预测其演化对地热系统、CO2封存等应用至关重要。

Method: 采用Transformer模型，结合水力压裂历史和微地震观测数据，预测微地震数量、地震矩及空间分布。

Conclusion: 该模型能实时推断裂缝扩展和渗透性变化，展示了深度学习在地震风险评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Result: 发现流行语言模型在模拟特定人群（如不同种族、年龄、收入）时表现不佳，尤其是在争议性问题中。

Conclusion: 需改进LLM在社会科学研究中的应用，避免简单模拟人类行为。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Motivation: 解决低收入和少数族裔社区在公共交通可达性方面的不平等问题，尤其是在纽约市这样的高密度城市。

Method: TFA框架包含三个部分：1) 使用区域表示学习预测冷启动站点的自行车共享需求；2) 结合预测需求与传统指标评估公共交通可达性；3) 提出考虑潜在乘客和公平性的新站点布局建议。

Result: 在纽约市的案例研究中，TFA显著减少了与经济及人口因素相关的公共交通可达性差距。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进公平公共交通的实用工具，提升了服务不足社区的生活质量。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在现实场景中面临分布式数据和隐私问题，联邦学习虽提供解决方案，但传统方法因模型规模和通信成本难以实现。

Method: FedNano采用服务器端集中LLM和客户端轻量级NanoEdge模块，通过低秩适配器减少存储和通信开销。

Result: 实验显示FedNano优于现有联邦学习方法，客户端存储减少95%，通信开销仅为模型参数的0.01%。

Conclusion: FedNano填补了MLLM规模与联邦学习可行性之间的鸿沟，支持可扩展的分散式多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Conclusion: 未来将通过与真实医生互动进一步验证MedSyn在诊断准确性和患者结果上的实用性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了视觉数据中的物理信息（如卫星图像的时空背景），导致模型难以有效捕捉这些信息。

Method: PIPE通过物理信息位置索引方案和变频率位置编码机制，将物理变量频率信息和序列顺序信息嵌入模型。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最优性能，台风强度预测提升12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过有效嵌入物理信息，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，用于解决多深度存储系统中异构物品配置的检索问题，通过结合GNN和Transformer模型优化检索延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物流对高效高密度存储系统的需求增加，但多深度AVS/RS系统因车道堵塞面临检索挑战，传统方法灵活性不足。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）和Transformer模型，设计了一种新的神经网络架构，结合物品属性和仓库拓扑结构，优化检索优先级。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化检索延迟方面优于启发式方法，且能适应不同布局的存储系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多深度存储系统中有效解决了异构物品检索问题，展示了深度强化学习在物流优化中的潜力。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Assembly-of-Experts'（AoE）的新方法，用于高效生成混合专家模型的子模型，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）的计算成本极高（每8位权重需要$10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs），效率低下。为了充分利用预训练模型的资源，作者开发了AoE方法。

Method: 通过线性时间内对父模型的权重张量进行插值，增强或抑制语义特征，生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的子模型（如DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera'）继承了父模型的智能，同时减少了40%的输出令牌，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法无需微调或蒸馏即可生成高性能子模型，为模型空间搜索提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 研究智能系统如何在支持广泛泛化的同时保持输入身份的选择性，揭示这一权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了有限语义分辨率下模型的泛化和识别能力，并扩展到噪声和异构空间。

Result: 理论预测了多输入处理能力的1/n崩溃和非单调最优泛化概率，实验验证了这些规律在简单和复杂模型中的普适性。

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深度网络和大脑表示能力的基本信息约束，为泛化-识别权衡提供了精确理论。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，结合语义索引嵌入和样条KAN网络，动态捕捉复杂时间特征。

Result: 实验证明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统Transformer模型。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效且多功能的时间序列预测模型，适合替代传统Transformer架构。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 尽管大型模型在推理能力上有显著进步，但视觉语言模型在计算资源有限时仍难以进行细致的视觉推理。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)训练小规模模型，结合简单奖励结构、工具调用接口优化和训练数据调整。

Result: 在类似规模的基线模型上，该方法在部分视觉问答任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过外部工具获取详细视觉信息，结合GRPO训练，能有效提升小规模模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合双向GRU和多头注意力机制的混合模型（BiGRU-MHA），用于SSD健康状态预测，显著提高了分类准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSD健康状态预测对数据可靠性至关重要，但传统模型存在泛化能力不足的问题，因此需要一种更准确且稳定的方法。

Method: 模型结合双向GRU（BiGRU）和多头注意力机制（MHA），前者捕捉SSD退化特征的双向时序依赖，后者动态分配特征权重以关注关键健康指标。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在训练集和测试集上的分类准确率分别为92.70%和92.44%，性能差距仅0.26%，AUC为0.94，表现出优异的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型为SSD健康预测提供了新技术方案，解决了传统模型的泛化瓶颈，具有实际应用价值，可降低数据丢失风险并优化维护成本。

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Motivation: 现有特征描述方法假设神经元仅编码单一概念（单义性），但实际中神经元常为多义性，导致描述表达受限。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，为多义性和单义性特征提供更细致的描述。

Result: PRISM在语言模型中表现优于现有方法，提高了描述质量和多义性捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更复杂的特征描述，提升了模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is

TL;DR: 论文提出CACTUS工具，用于改进AMD分期分类，解决医疗数据不完整和模型透明度问题，优于标准ML模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据常不完整且ML模型缺乏透明度，尤其在AMD早期诊断中，需综合考虑多种因素。

Method: 开发CACTUS工具，结合遗传、饮食、临床和人口统计因素，提供可解释性和灵活性。

Result: CACTUS优于标准ML模型，能识别关键因素并消除偏差数据，提升决策信心。

Conclusion: CACTUS为AMD诊断提供更可靠工具，支持临床反馈和偏差修正。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的方法LoX，通过外推LLM的安全子空间来增强其安全性，显著降低了微调攻击的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM已通过对齐提升安全性，但微调仍可能破坏其安全保护，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间以增强鲁棒性。

Result: LoX在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时，攻击成功率降低了11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移至平坦区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，有效提升了LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种自动从人类反馈中提取规则并转化为规则奖励的方法，显著提升了强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在实现完全自动化。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集。

Result: 使用AutoRule训练的模型在AlpacaEval2.0上相对提升28.6%，在MT-Bench子集上提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule减少了奖励篡改，提取的规则能捕捉数据集独特价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用控制微分方程（CDE）状态表示来提升脓毒症治疗的强化学习效果，强调训练稳定性和临床相关性是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脓毒症治疗的强化学习方法在状态表示学习中存在训练不稳定的问题，影响策略性能，需解决这一问题。

Method: 采用控制微分方程（CDE）状态表示，结合早期停止或稳定化方法确保训练稳定性，并通过临床评分（SOFA、SAPS-II、OASIS）相关性正则化增强表示。

Result: 实验显示稳定CDE表示能生成与临床评分强相关的表示，并实现高性能强化学习策略（WIS回报>0.9），而不稳定表示导致策略失败（WIS回报≈0）。

Conclusion: 研究为临床强化学习中不规则医疗时间序列的表示学习提供了实用指南，强调训练稳定性的重要性。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

TL;DR: SFT-GO是一种新颖的监督微调方法，通过按重要性分组优化令牌，提升语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法对所有令牌一视同仁，忽略了关键令牌的重要性，导致性能受限。

Method: SFT-GO根据令牌重要性分组，结合最差组损失和标准交叉熵损失进行优化。

Result: SFT-GO在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，且适用于不同数据集和基础模型。

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过分组优化令牌，显著提升了语言模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）用于提取语言模型的可解释特征，但许多潜在特征频繁激活（即“密集”）。研究发现这些密集特征并非训练噪声，而是具有功能意义的模型表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏自编码器中密集潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，以澄清它们是否仅为训练噪声或具有实际意义。

Method: 系统分析密集潜在特征的几何结构、功能分类及其在模型各层的演化，并通过消融实验验证其必要性。

Result: 密集潜在特征形成对偶对，重构残差流中的特定方向，并具有多种功能分类（如位置追踪、语义绑定等）。它们在模型各层中从结构特征逐渐演化为语义和输出信号。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算中的功能性组成部分，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在神经架构搜索和超参数优化中计算成本过高，限制了广泛应用。

Method: SPG通过临时模块扩展基础模型，单次前向生成状态-动作轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能提升0.2%至7%，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: SPG是一种高效且广泛适用的超参数优化方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有参数高效微调方法在推理延迟、收敛性和固定秩选择方面的不足。

Method: 结合Kronecker乘积和张量分解，采用SVD初始化和动态秩选择算法。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SoKA仅需0.99M可训练参数，比LoRA/PiSSA少25%，性能匹配或超越基线，且收敛更快、梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: SoKA是一种高效、稳健的大规模模型适应方法。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Motivation: 现有的后验归因方法对输入扰动高度敏感，导致归因图不稳定，影响了其可信度，因此需要一种能够提供严格鲁棒性保证的方法。

Method: 通过随机平滑技术，将归因图稀疏化和平滑化，并将其转化为分割问题，以认证每个像素的重要性。同时提出了三种评估指标来衡量认证鲁棒性、定位性和忠实性。

Result: 在12种归因方法和5个ImageNet模型上的广泛评估表明，该方法生成的认证归因具有鲁棒性、可解释性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为归因方法提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证，使其能够在下游任务中更可信地使用。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

Motivation: 传统的时间序列可视化方法仅关注点对点对齐，无法传达子序列层面的结构关系，难以理解时间序列之间的位移、加速或减速。

Method: 提出了一种新技术，简化扭曲路径以突出关键变换（位移、压缩、幅度差异），并提供更清晰的子序列匹配表示。

Result: 该方法能够更清晰地展示时间序列之间的子序列匹配关系，提升了比较的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过简化扭曲路径并可视化关键变换，该方法显著改善了时间序列比较的定性和定量分析能力。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多领域表现优异，但其信息传播能力存在根本性限制（如过压缩问题）。时空GNNs中的这一问题尚未被研究，而时间维度加剧了信息传播的挑战。

Method: 论文形式化了时空过压缩问题，分析了卷积STGNNs的信息传播特性，并比较了不同处理范式（时间-空间或时间优先）的影响。

Result: 研究发现，卷积STGNNs倾向于传播时间上较远而非较近的信息，且不同处理范式均受此现象影响。理论分析支持了高效实现方法。

Conclusion: 研究为STGNNs的设计提供了理论指导和实践验证，有助于更高效的模型实现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePCS是一种无需模型访问或重新训练的诊断方法，通过比较两种推理路径的KL散度来检测RAG系统是否依赖记忆而非检索信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统可能依赖记忆的训练数据而非检索的外部信息，导致输出污染，需要一种轻量级方法来检测此类行为。

Method: RePCS通过比较仅使用查询的推理路径和使用查询加检索上下文的推理路径的KL散度，判断检索信息的影响。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC达到0.918，优于之前方法6.5个百分点，延迟开销低于4.7%。

Conclusion: RePCS提供了一种轻量级、黑盒的安全保障方法，特别适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过扩展Gold的归纳推理框架，引入计算观察和受限输入源，研究极限下可计算函数的学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入输出观察不足以学习一般递归函数，需引入更现实的约束条件（如时间限制观察和策略轨迹观察）以突破学习障碍。

Method: 提出时间限制观察和策略轨迹观察，构建计算代理观察的正式框架，并研究其与有限状态转换器推断的联系。

Result: 在策略轨迹观察下，学习可计算函数可简化为学习有理函数的输入输出，但线性时间可计算函数不存在可计算或多项式质量特征集。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的观察类型和约束条件，扩展了极限下可计算函数的学习能力，但也揭示了某些函数类的学习限制。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Motivation: Wi-Fi指纹定位在实际部署中因设备异质性和时间变化导致的域偏移问题，现有方法独立处理这些问题，泛化能力差且易受灾难性遗忘影响。

Method: 提出DAILOC框架，采用解耦策略分离域偏移与位置相关特征，结合多级变分自编码器和记忆引导的潜在对齐机制。

Conclusion: DAILOC通过联合处理域偏移和灾难性遗忘，显著提升了Wi-Fi指纹定位的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Motivation: 现有深度学习框架在室内定位中缺乏可解释性，难以应对环境动态变化和长期可靠性问题。

Method: 引入LogNet，通过逻辑门识别关键接入点（APs）并分析环境噪声对定位决策的影响。

Result: LogNet在多个真实建筑平面和两年时间变化中表现优异，定位误差降低1.1x至2.8x，模型大小缩小3.4x至43.3x，延迟降低1.5x至3.6x。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Motivation: 机器学习中的公平性对构建可信赖的AI系统至关重要，但训练数据中的标签偏差会影响模型性能和公平性评估。

Method: 结合预测置信度测量、基于图的Ricci流优化拉普拉斯正则化和显式人口统计公平性激励。

Result: 实验表明，GFLC在性能和公平性指标之间的权衡上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GFLC是一种高效的方法，能够有效纠正标签噪声并提升模型的公平性。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

*Vincent Roca,Marc Tommasi,Paul Andrey,Aurélien Bellet,Markus D. Schirmer,Hilde Henon,Laurent Puy,Julien Ramon,Grégory Kuchcinski,Martin Bretzner,Renaud Lopes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了联邦学习（FL）在缺血性卒中患者中估计脑预测年龄差（BrainAGE）的性能，并探讨了其与临床表型和功能结果的关联。FL在无需数据集中化的情况下实现了准确的预测，且BrainAGE与血管风险因素及卒中后恢复显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练稳健的BrainAGE模型通常需要大量数据，但隐私问题限制了数据共享。FL作为一种分布式学习方法，可以在保护隐私的同时实现高性能。

Method: 研究使用1674名卒中患者的FLAIR脑图像，比较了集中学习、FL和单站点学习三种策略的BrainAGE预测性能，并分析了BrainAGE与血管风险因素及功能结果的关系。

Result: FL的预测性能优于单站点模型，且BrainAGE与糖尿病等血管风险因素显著相关。BrainAGE还与卒中后功能恢复显著相关。

Conclusion: FL为卒中护理中的预后建模提供了潜在工具，同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与经典机器学习，利用量子力学原理提升性能。本研究通过评估量子神经网络（QNNs），证明其在风力预测任务中优于经典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管QML潜力巨大，但当前NISQ设备的局限性引发对其实际优势的质疑。本研究旨在验证QNNs的有效性。

Method: 构建并评估12种QNN配置，结合两种量子特征映射和六种纠缠策略，在风力数据集上进行实验。

Result: 使用Z特征映射的QNNs在仅四个输入参数下达到93%的预测准确率，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展示了QML在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多源观测降尺度模型（MODS），通过融合多种卫星和地形数据，结合条件扩散模型，显著提高了气象变量的降尺度精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率地表气象条件的准确获取对气象预报和模拟至关重要。现有降尺度方法主要依赖单一卫星数据，无法全面捕捉气象变量的变化。

Method: MODS是一种条件扩散模型，融合了多种卫星数据（GridSat、AMSU-A、HIRS、MHS）和地形数据（GEBCO），并通过多源交叉注意力模块提取特征。

Result: 实验表明，MODS在将ERA5数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率时，具有更高的保真度。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合和条件扩散模型，显著提升了气象变量降尺度的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的作用增强，对可解释AI（XAI）的需求增加，但现有评估常忽视认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Method: 提出CUE模型，研究不同颜色映射（BWR、Cividis、Coolwarm）对热图解释的影响，实验涉及455名参与者。

Result: 实验发现任务表现相似，但视觉障碍用户的信心和努力程度较低，且专为无障碍设计的颜色映射（如Cividis）并未改善甚至加剧了差距。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了感知优化的假设，支持自适应XAI界面的需求，验证了CUE模型，并推动了以用户为中心的可访问XAI设计。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合DALL-E 3和材料数据集的新方法，为AI生成的设计提供可持续性指标和材料使用数据，帮助设计师评估环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在室内设计中能快速生成视觉效果，但缺乏可操作的数据，尤其是可持续性指标。

Method: 通过后处理模块识别AI生成设计中的材料，并匹配CO2e值，结合用户测试评估效果。

Result: 引入可持续性指标能促进更环保的设计决策，但也可能引发决策疲劳。

Conclusion: 平衡设计自由与可持续性约束是AI辅助建筑设计的关键。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

Result: 揭示了六大需求主题及矛盾，提出了AI设计建议。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更可信、以护理者为中心的AI系统提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

across diverse users. Reinforcement learning optimizes interface elements like
menu layouts and interaction modes. Experiments demonstrate a 20% improvement
in task completion efficiency and a 25% increase in user satisfaction for
motor-impaired users compared to baseline AR systems. This approach enhances AR
accessibility and scalability. Keywords: Deep learning, Federated learning,

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的‘共创学习’范式，通过人类与AI共同整合部分感知信息和知识，构建共享的外部表征，即符号涌现。实验基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG）验证了这一框架，结果显示人类与MHNG智能体显著提升了分类准确性并实现了更强的符号系统共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI教学基于单向知识传递，无法解决不同模态信息的整合问题。本文旨在探索人类与AI如何通过动态对齐感知体验实现共创学习。

Method: 采用基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG）的分散式贝叶斯推理机制，设计在线实验，69名参与者与三种不同类型的AI智能体（MHNG、总是接受或总是拒绝）进行联合注意力命名游戏（JA-NG）。

Result: 实验结果表明，人类与MHNG智能体的配对显著提升了分类准确性，并实现了更强的符号系统共享。人类接受行为与MHNG推导的接受概率高度一致。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了人类与AI通过MHNG互动实现共创学习的实证证据，为构建动态对齐感知体验的共生AI系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN的对称和刚性核限制了局部特征的提取，作者希望通过引入不对称核（Deformer）来更好地结合注意力机制。

Method: 在Conformer架构中用变形卷积（Deformer）替换深度卷积，分析其局部感受野和全局注意力图。

Result: Deformer在WSJ eval92数据集上相对WER提升了5.6%（无LM）和6.4%（有LM）。

Conclusion: Deformer通过自适应视图和变形卷积显著提升了语音识别性能，并揭示了特征随网络深度的变化规律。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

Motivation: 传统修剪方法需多次修剪和重新训练，效率低，本文旨在通过动态调整子网络结构，减少语言特定修剪的需求。

Method: 采用自适应掩码方法，动态调整子网络结构，避免固定子网络结构的过早决策。

Result: 在稀疏单语言模型上优于现有修剪方法；Dynamic ASR Pathways通过不同子网络初始化联合发现并训练更好的子网络。

Conclusion: 自适应掩码方法高效且性能优越，Dynamic ASR Pathways减少了语言特定修剪的需求。

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Motivation: 解决低资源自动语音识别（ASR）中数据不足的问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Method: MixRep通过插值隐藏表示的特征维度，并结合时间轴正则化，应用于Conformer编码器和E2E LAS架构。

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集上，MixRep相比SpecAugment基线，WER相对降低了6.5%和6.7%。

Conclusion: MixRep是一种简单有效的低资源ASR数据增强方法，显著优于其他正则化方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

Conclusion: 该方法成功捕捉了文本线索与空间音频之间的关系，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)
with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities.
However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition
and source localization tasks.

Method: HAC通过将瓶颈分解为三个层次，并结合HuBERT和LaBSE的知识蒸馏目标，实现了语音的分层编码。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，有望在下游语音生成和理解任务中发挥作用。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Method: 开发了BMFM-RNA框架，支持多种输入表示和训练目标，包括新的WCED目标，并在CELLxGENE数据集上预训练了四个模型。

Result: WCED模型在零样本和微调任务中性能优于或匹配scGPT等现有方法。

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础，有助于开发更有效的细胞生物学AI工具。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Motivation: 现有群体识别方法未能充分建模用户群体和项目兴趣的协同演化关系，导致推荐效果不佳。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CI4GI通过协同建模双层次兴趣，有效提升群体推荐性能。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的对齐方法，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式规则，自动化程度低且性能不佳，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数，代理根据任务背景和输出格式配置，并通过提示驱动WS-PSO-CM算法进行探索。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM背景的LLM代理能有效找到高性能超参数，提升算法表现。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.
